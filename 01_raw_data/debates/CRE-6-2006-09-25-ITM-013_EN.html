I should also like to extend my especial thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its efforts so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution is and will remain one of the most important public health problems. As a result of air pollution, life expectancy in the European Union today has fallen by 8.5 months. The quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people is reduced every day and the natural environment is in danger, despite the significant reductions in emissions achieved over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to step up our efforts. The strategy we propose defines the steps we need to make in this direction. It lays down new, unprecedented targets for health and the environment. The measures on small suspended particles will bring about a reduction in forecasts of premature deaths from approximately 350 000 today to 160 000 in 2020. That will be the outcome of the combined application of the strategy and other measures already agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the natural environment is concerned, we expect the size of ecosystems at risk of acidification to fall by over 50% and the size of ecosystems at risk due to the presence of excessive nitrogen levels to fall by over 30%. These are ambitious targets, the achievement of which will bring exponential environmental benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy will of course have to be applied effectively. The Commission has promised to propose measures at European Union level to improve ambient air. This will also address the problem of cross-border pollution. The strategy on air describes some of the related Community measures. The Commission has already tabled a proposal to reduce emissions from passenger cars and vans, often referred to as the Euro V proposal, and the Committee on the Environment recently approved its draft report. A Euro VI proposal is expected for cars and vans. Other Euro VI proposals will also be tabled for lorries and buses and the directive on national upper emission limits will also be reviewed, setting new emission limits for the Member States. Other measures for small-scale combustion and farming will follow when the time is right. All these measures are currently being prepared and will of course be evaluated in detail in accordance with the principles of better lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main elements of the strategy is the proposed review of current legislation on ambient air quality. The proposal maintains the current limit values for air quality. The official statistics of the World Health Organisation clearly confirm that these limit values are needed. The proposal introduces for the first time binding limits for small thin particles known as PM2.5, in other words particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 millionths of a metre. Scientists unanimously maintain that these particles have serious repercussions on public health. Maximum permissible concentration limits are proposed for entry into force in 2010. The proposal will, at the same time, require the Member States to start monitoring these thin particles carefully in all European countries. Measures will also be taken with a view to reducing the average levels of exposure to micro particles of the population. Approval of these measures must not be delayed. The repercussions on health are extremely serious and the data are incontrovertible. In the United States, PM2.5 targets have applied since 1995. The statistics included in the study on the repercussions of this proposal prove that the approach we propose of reducing exposure to micro particles will benefit more people at a lower cost that the lower PM2.5 limit proposed by Parliament. The Commission proposal also gives the Member States greater flexibility as far as their compliance with current limit values for air quality is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Uncontrolled emissions from natural sources are not included in the figures. A longer deadline will also be granted in cases where the Member States face acute compliance problems. These extensions must be as short as possible, in order to protect the health of our fellow citizens and not penalise the Member States which have made serious and credible efforts to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment very briefly on some of the basic amendments proposed by Parliament: as regards the possibility of extending deadlines, the Commission proposes an additional five years from the date on which the limit values enter into force, in other words no later than the end of 2009, in conjunction with the facility to exclude emissions from natural sources. With these arrangements, the Member States will clearly be in a position to comply with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment has proposed two five-year periods from the date on which the new directive enters into force. Under this proposal, compliance will be delayed to 2018 for limit values already agreed in 1999. This cannot be accepted. The new amendment tabled before this plenary, Amendment 81, is a move in the right direction, but again cannot be accepted because, if we accept four plus two years from the entry into force of the new directive, this will delay compliance until 2013 for the limit values for PM10 already agreed in 1999. In other words, the Member States already recognised these limits back in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the decision by the Council and Parliament on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, the Commission asked experts from the World Health Organisation to advise if the limit values which currently apply for air quality need to be changed. They replied that they did not. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept any watering down of the daily limit value for PM10. Amendments 46 and 81 increase the number of days on which this value may be exceeded from 35 to 55. If these amendments were to be accepted, then according to the statistics for 2004, there would no longer be any need for measures to combat air pollution in cities such as Vienna, Frankfurt, Bonn, Stuttgart and others. The basic question is: how can we best serve the health of our citizens? By watering down the daily limit value or by taking measures to combat the problem of pollution?</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment watering down the limit values likewise cannot be accepted, unless it is preceded by new Community measures to reduce pollution. It conflicts with the right of initiative of the institutions. It is also impracticable, because it is impossible to predict the results of measures which have not yet been proposed and, in this case, would undermine the right of the citizens to clean air.</p>

That there is not always complete agreement about everything, whether within this House or between one institution and another, should become the norm in European democracy, for what really matters is that we, although we approach it from different angles and with different priorities, should have one single end in mind, that being that air quality in Europe should be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">That many respiratory diseases and the consequences resulting from them are attributable to high levels of air pollution, particularly in densely-populated areas and conurbations in the EU, is not disputed. Polluted air takes no account of borders, and so improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge. The problem of air pollution can only be solved in the long term and in a European framework, particularly by stepping up cross-border measures. In order for the ambitious goals to be achieved, further instruments will be needed in the Community in future: clean air in the Member States can only be achieved if the directives which are in force are transposed consistently and if new EU legislative proposals concentrate on restricting emissions at the point where polluters cause them.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is justifiable concern about the state of ambient air in Europe, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that air quality in Europe has, over the past decades, been improved as a result of stringent legal regulation and technical advances.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the July vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and looking forward to the vote we are about to take in this plenary, all three of the main groups in this House negotiated a package of compromise amendments, which can be summed up as aiming for, on the one hand, ambitious limit and target values, with, on the other, greater flexibility and consideration of the difficulties that individual Member States face with the transposition of the current directive. Let me briefly sketch out the essential points.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with PM10. There is a large degree of consensus in this House about the lack of ambition inherent in allowing the 40 microgram annual average value for PM10 to remain unchanged after 2010. This value is already adhered to in most European cities. The Commission had already announced a more stringent annual average value for PM10 with effect from 2010, but, as this present proposal makes no reference to it, the three big groups propose that the threshold value for PM10 be reduced to 33 micrograms with effect from 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Commissioner, that I find it remarkable, in view of the criticism that these compromises attract, that you continually neglect to make this very point. Where the PM10 annual limit values are concerned, there is a marked downward turn. I would like to point out that this is not an example of the dilution of limit values that has attracted such strong criticism from the environmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The daily limit value for PM10, according to which 50 micrograms may be exceeded on at most 35 days in the year, has come in for forthright criticism from many Members, but the fact is that there is no correlation between the current daily and annual threshold values, and, moreover, the figure of 35 days is arbitrary. Nobody in this House would doubt the importance of carrying out daily measurements and informing at-risk groups of increased concentrations of pollutants. On the other hand, no credible scientist has as yet claimed that the daily limit value is more relevant to health policy than the annual one. The problems cities have with compliance with the daily limit value are no secret, and we abandon municipalities to a sort of organised helplessness. It has now been demonstrated that compliance with daily limit values is completely unrelated to any clean air measures, but rather largely dependent on chance meteorological phenomena.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment and the three main groups in this House endorse the compromise proposal according to which the cities and municipalities affected would, in tandem with a reduction in the annual limit value of approximately 20%, be allowed – albeit only subject to certain conditions – rather more flexibility and permitted to comply with a limit value on a maximum of 55 rather than 35 days.</p>
<p class="contents">There may be those who will have their doubts about the correlation between the daily and annual limit values proposed by this House, but nobody can claim with any seriousness that we are thereby being any less ambitious than the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to PM2.5, the smallest particles, which are, according to all the experts, the source of the greatest hazards to health. However, the data obtained in Europe on PM2.5 are as yet uncertain, and most Member States have had insufficient experience with measurements of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose a two-stage regulation for PM2.5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 onwards, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20 micrograms; this too, is more ambitious than what the Council and the Commission are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority in this House agrees that the 25 microgram annual average value as proposed by the Commission is lacking in ambition and that we should therefore reduce it. In its proposal, the Commission opted for an overall reduction of 20% for PM2.5 without undertaking any further impact assessment relating to the practical actions and costs resulting from it for each individual Member State. Like my fellow members of the committee, I am persuaded that a graduated model, with Member States being treated differently and greater account taken of previous achievements, is in any case preferable to aiming for a reduction across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something about Article 20. I could understand the Commission’s and outside bodies' criticisms of the 5+5 rule – which aims to institute a time delay in order to enable the limit values to be reached. We have put together a new package called ‘4+2’, which represents a move towards the position taken by the Commission, which, as we know, is proposing a five-year period. I would like to reiterate air quality in Europe will be achieved only in the long term and only by means of actions targeting the problem at source, that is, the causes of pollution. I look to the Commission in expectation of the proposals that it has announced for reducing pollution at its source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dorette Corbey (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, whilst I assume this generous gesture applies to the second speaker from the floor today, I shall attempt to keep it brief. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start with a brief word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for this topic, Mr Krahmer, Mrs Weisgerber and Mr Wijkman, along with all other shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this positive outcome. Air quality is a major health problem and when, more than six months ago, I started to look into it in depth, I was shocked by just how great it turned out to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans die some nine months prematurely on account of air quality, and 350 000 people die ten years prematurely. Millions of people suffer from asthma and related disorders. Bad air quality does not affect everyone in the same way. People who live in large cities, along motorways, children and the elderly are the worst affected. In addition, air pollution, and the acid rain that results from it, represent a major environmental problem in large swathes of Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason, Commissioner, that we expect firm policy to curb air pollution and that is why we are disappointed with the proposals you have put forward. Mr Krahmer’s report, and my own, are above all an indictment of the attitude of indifference where air pollution is concerned. We demand, in fact, three political changes. First of all stricter standards; secondly, that more attention be given to implementation; and, thirdly, action to address the problem of air pollution at source.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the standards first, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls, in both reports, for a more ambitious approach, and that is something that is desperately needed. In the thematic strategy, the level of ambition opted for lies between A, B and C and the Maximum Technically Feasible Reduction scenario. All impact assessment studies indicate that even the maximum scenario is still cost-effective and that the ideal scenario lies between B and C. Nevertheless, the Commission, incidentally without any further explanation, has chosen level of ambition A+, which, in terms of public health, is an incomprehensible choice. A higher level of ambition is possible, as the United States has proven, and is also very cost-effective, as is evident from all studies that underpin it.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the proposals that are tabled in my report may be a few billions more expensive, they yield definite health gains. They are also a definite incentive for innovation. In the directive, the Commission proposes a new form for the finer particles, PM2.5. The finest particles are most harmful to health and the standard is also more precise, because the smallest particles contain fewer natural sources such as sea salt and desert sand. PM2.5 is therefore a better measure, although the way in which the Commission has fleshed it out is very disappointing. Parliament has demanded a target and limit value of 20 µg/m3 for PM2.5. This is considerably better than the 25 µg which the Commission and Council back, but still worse than the 15 µg in the United States and the 10 µg recommended by the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, in fact, very interested to see how the Commission will integrate the level of ambition selected for the strategy by Parliament in future legislation and in the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. Would you be in a position to say anything on this matter, Commissioner? Will you now follow Parliament’s example and opt for a level of ambition that lies between B and C?</p>
<p class="contents">Better standards are needed, as I said before, but that is only one of the three pillars. Our second pillar is attention for implementation. To date, efforts on the part of the Member States have not been altogether convincing. Only four Member States are in full compliance with the limit values as specified in the present directive. It is up to the Commission to ensure that these are observed, and that is also necessary, because air pollution is a cross-border problem. Since half of the Netherlands’ air pollution is imported from abroad, it cannot possibly make the air cleaner on its own, and it must be able to rely on the Belgian, British and German Governments making every effort to tackle air pollution. Conversely, the Netherlands exports an awful lot of pollution, and that is why the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Belgium must be able to count on the Netherlands pulling out all the stops to make the air cleaner.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Commission has not reacted very convincingly to Member States that exceed the standards. By introducing new provisions in the directive, the Committee on the Environment is hoping to galvanise the Commission into taking a more active role. Member States will be under a clear obligation to make efforts. Some countries need more time to achieve the limit values than others. I can go along with that, as long as they make the effort, and no exceptions without efforts. Only adequate efforts warrant exceptions. Exceptions are not, as the Commission proposal suggests, a premium for ‘doing nothing’, and Amendment 66 bears this out.</p>
<p class="contents">The third pillar is an ambitious source policy. Without source policy, without policy to make cars, freight traffic, shipping and industry cleaner, it is extremely difficult for the Member States, and certainly for the densely populated Member States, to make the air cleaner. That is why air quality can be improved only by bringing traffic and industry to a standstill. Those are Draconian and, at the same time, not very effective measures. It will be the lower authorities, rather than anyone else, that will be asked to foot the bill, and that, of course, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious source policy has a positive impact on air, the environment and public health, but ultimately also cuts down on energy and benefits the climate on account of reduced CO2 emissions. It is also conducive to innovation: cleaner and more economical cars, for example, sell better. That is why the Committee on the Environment wishes to include in the directive Article 30A, which demands source policy by 2010. That is why the strategy proposes an interinstitutional agreement in which source policy can be enshrined. Moreover, Member States must, if there is no source policy, be able to take their own source measures outside of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution is a serious problem, but the good news is that it can be resolved, provided we are willing to display the political will. The Committee on the Environment has, in my view, laid down a firm basis with these three pillars. In the new compromise, we have also given teeth to matters as they stand and improved them, and I am once again indebted to everyone who has made a contribution, particularly Mr Krahmer, Mrs Weisgerber and Mr Wijkman. With stricter standards, more attention for implementation and source policy, we have made a few major policy changes. This approach stands for a new Europe, close to the people, with a view to implementing legislation by national and local governments, with innovation in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we are to achieve our main goal, that of effective and lasting improvement in air quality, it is vital that we establish limit values, but they, on their own, cannot improve the quality of the air; that can be done only through effective action to deal with emissions, such as the Euro 5 emissions standard that has already been proposed and which makes soot particle filters mandatory for new vehicles. It is primarily from the Commission that we demand further measures, in the shape, for example, of rules on residential combustion sources, Euro 6 for HGVs and Europe-wide limit values for ships’ engines.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, we want to get away from actions that grab headlines but are no more than short-term and temporary, in favour of long-term measures that, by addressing the problem at its source, protect health more effectively. That is why our annual limit values, at 33 milligrams per square metre, are more ambitious than the Commission’s, and why we want more flexibility at the local level when it comes to daily limit values, which have been demonstrated to be largely subject to meteorological influences, since it is a proven fact that it is long-term exposure that is the most dangerous, and that is what we have to focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">By reducing the annual limit values for particulates we seek to create incentives for long-term and sustainable projects such as environmental zones or the introduction of soot filters. More rigorous annual limit values and the effective reduction of long-term pollution brings people more benefits than closing a road for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class="contents">At national and local level, too, everything proportionate and necessary must be done to improve air quality, and we are creating the right incentives for that as well. Local authorities will have their deadlines extended to a maximum of six years only if they can produce action programmes that show that they have, within the bounds of proportionality, taken every step in their power to improve air quality; moreover, this concession will not be granted to all of them, but only to those that demonstrably have to contend with particularly unfavourable meteorological conditions brought on, among other things, by being located in basins.</p>
<p class="contents">These clear messages are precisely what this compromise is about, and it thereby constitutes an even-handed and effective way of giving public health the protection it needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good thing that fine particles, the fine PM2.5 particles in fact, are included in the directive, and that binding limit values are to be set for them. The limit value proposed by the Commission and supported by the Council is 20 micrograms, as has been mentioned more than once here. It has also been mentioned that Parliament is calling for a more stringent value. This is all very well, but if we compare this proposal to the needs which, for example, the World Health Organisation has proposed and which would get us to a situation where we would no longer be causing harm to human health or having an adverse effect on nature’s levels of tolerance, this limit value is just too high. The WHO is proposing 10 micrograms, and, as has been said here, in the United States of America and Canada they have already achieved a value of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in Europe, and people are exposed to it. Here someone mentioned a figure of 360 000-400 000 premature deaths a year. Whatever the figure is, it is very large. The limit value that is set can have a genuine impact on the number of human lives that can be saved. If this recommendation by the WHO were to come into force, the figure would be several tens of thousands. With the limit values now being proposed, we would reach a figure of just a few thousand lives. Parliament, however, is calling for more stringent limit values for these smaller particles, which I endorse. I do not, however, endorse the fact that the deadline for implementation is to be extended. I hope that we will be able to improve on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am rapporteur for the last phase of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. It set relatively ambitious aims, and that applies to air quality too. Its objective was to ensure that we no longer cause harm to human health. Now it has to be said that with this first legislative thematic strategy, which is meant to fulfil the aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, we will not achieve the targets contained in it. This will also water down the targets we settled on in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this legislation – and I am mainly focusing on the draft directive – is therefore commendable, and I am particularly supportive of Mr Krahmer’s attempts to make it as workable as possible. We should nevertheless question, though, whether we in the European Union are on the right track and whether the legislation we are drafting is not symbolic.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I saying this? While we want to impose strict requirements on Member States, they even fail to meet the old air quality standards. Since the entry into effect of the Air Quality Directive in 2005, which specifies ceilings for PM10 dust particles, ten Member States have failed to meet the requirements. Even before 2005, it should have been obvious to the Commission that Member States would not meet the limit values without a systematic source policy involving restrictions on exhaust fumes from cars, lorries and ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 2002 and 2004, approximately 96% of the cities exceeded the daily standards, and the annual standards were exceeded in various regions in southern Europe, the Benelux countries and in Germany, as well as in central and eastern Europe, accounting for some 73% of the cities. Without source measures, that were often announced years ago by the Commission, stricter or less strict values for PM10 or PM2.5 serve no purpose whatsoever, and I am not even talking about nitrogen.</p>
<p class="contents">Without source measures, Member States will be unable to comply with the limit values, and I am of course delighted to hear the Commissioner confirm that they will produce all those source measures, but not just yet. There is phenomenal opposition to this policy in the Commission, and, in fact, also in this House. Local short-term measures are ineffective. Effective policy must focus on long-term measures, and must therefore also include source policy, which this, however, does not. The object of the legislation is commendable, but the path chosen to reach it is questionable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Experts in environmental health have said that the Commission’s proposal was bewilderingly inadequate, but will the European Parliament now give cause for even greater bewilderment? The majority on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are actually proposing that current legislation should be made less stringent. It postponed entry into force by more than 10 years, and would double the number of days when limit values for pollution can be exceeded, from 30 to 55 a year. It offered the excuse that in the distant future yearly limit values would come down from 40 to 30 micrograms per cubic metre. This is only an apparent improvement, however, as the current limit value, if it may be exceeded on more than 35 days, in practice represents an annual average of 30 micrograms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a falsehood that companies with daily limit values would have a negligible impact on health. On the contrary, the hospitals always have more heart patients coming in when daily pollution levels have been exceeded. This scandalous suggestion by the Committee on the Environment was justified by saying that the Member States could not do any better. The Member States themselves in the Council, however, have provisionally agreed on a tougher line, where postponement would only be for three years. Following this preliminary display of agreement in the Council, the three largest groups made a more spruced up compromise proposal, which would nevertheless still postpone the entry into force of norms for longer than that in the proposal by the EC Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been awful to witness how the negotiators in certain groups have taken guidance from the automotive industry. It will be a shame indeed if Parliament’s largest groups succumb to pressure from lobbies in the car industry.</p>

The Commission’s own calculations show that getting on for 370 000 premature deaths per year are caused by emissions into the air. Particulate emissions are the most important cause of these premature deaths, to which should be added all the health problems that affect people with asthma or allergies of one kind or another, children being an especially vulnerable group. Air pollution also creates major environmental problems in the form of eutrophication, acidification and ground-level ozone. There are clear reasons in terms of health and the environment for placing a strict limit on these emissions. Socio-economic calculations lead to the same conclusion. Society would benefit significantly by avoiding these costs linked to emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed thematic strategy and proposal for a directive on better air quality are therefore a disappointment. The level of ambition is very low. Once again, we have been given sad confirmation that an ambitious environmental policy is not a priority for this European Commission. Unfortunately, the draft reports produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are also inadequate compromises. The decisions proposed in them are quite simply not good enough to provide real remedies to the problems. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have therefore tabled a number of amendments with a view to making the proposals for directives more stringent. There are a number of purposes behind these various amendments. Firstly, we wish to remove the very generous exemptions that Member States would be allowed and as a result of which we should have to wait an unnecessary number of years before seeing the directive implemented in practice. Where the exposure reduction target is concerned, we believe that this should be binding, and we believe that it can be increased to 25%. When it comes to the concentration cap for particles, we wish to reduce this to ten micrograms, so putting it at the same level as that recommended for industrialised countries by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We also believe that the same requirements for low levels of pollution should be imposed everywhere, irrespective of natural sources of emissions. Otherwise, environments of different quality would be required for different people, dependent on where they happened to live. That is our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I want to use the last half-minute to say a personal thank you. Tomorrow, I am standing down as a Member of the European Parliament, so this is my last speech in the House. I wish to thank those fellow Members with whom I have worked during the last 11 years. It has been a pleasure to have been able to work in this House. I also wish to thank Parliament’s services and, above all, the interpreters. Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="contents">As a Member of the Committee on Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety I support the strategy on air quality that has been set out by the Commission. That strategy sets out a series of health and environmental objectives and emissions reduction targets for the main pollutants. It calls on the Commission to bring forward a range of sector-based initiatives, including the following: reducing emissions from shipping; reducing emissions of ammonia from agricultural use; the extension of integrated pollution prevention and control measures for smaller units; more stringent emissions standards for vehicles, and the implementation of a national emissions ceiling directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We all recognise the significant benefits that accrue from reduced air pollution and we support cost-effective integrated approaches to achieving improvements in air quality. Undoubtedly greater investment in renewable energies and in the biofuel sector will also help to create a cleaner environment.</p>
<p class="contents">My report on the future of the biofuels industry was recently strongly approved by the Environment Committee. Key points that I made in that report included the following: biofuels emit between 40% and 80% fewer greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels; biofuels offer new sources of income for farmers via sustainable and multifunctional agriculture of the kind the common agricultural policy purports to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be ambitious in the strategies it pursues to promote the use of biofuels. We must stimulate a greater demand for biofuels in Europe and we must guarantee that the seventh EU R&amp;D Framework Programme for the period 2007 to 2013 is geared heavily towards the promotion of the biofuels sector within EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can all recognise the potential of renewable energy as an important means to boost employment and create added value in rural areas. The decoupling of income support from production introduced by the 2003 common agricultural policy reform will help to facilitate the supply of energy crops. The advent of biofuels is good news for the agricultural sector in Europe and in Ireland and it is good news for the medium- to long-term protection of our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We need firm action in the European Union to promote the biofuels sector. We know the importance of that sector. We know of the environmental benefits, so let us now go and collectively meet that challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, the problems that are current in the Netherlands should also be evident in nearly all other Member States, certainly in the urban areas. The agreement that has been reached between the political groups throws open the possibility for delay, rightly so, before the limit values for PM10 start taking effect, and I shall be advising my group to vote in favour of it. I should, in fact, like to draw your particular attention to Amendment 76, because it is my belief that the agreement – and, I think, wrongly – has taken no account of the position of nitrogen oxide. I should like to ask the Members to support that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to Commissioner Dimas. So far, Commissioner, you have always claimed that the Commission cannot agree to the idea of a possible delay in combination with new measures from the Commission. You will notice tomorrow that you have a broad majority facing you. You also undoubtedly read the report last week compiled by the Institute for European Environmental Policy, which states that combining the two would be a very good thing. Is there really no chance of you meeting us half-way in this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, a word of thanks to both rapporteurs.

Air pollution is known to reduce average life expectancy by as much as nine months. More than half of Europeans are living in conditions where the daily concentration limit is exceeded more than 35 times a year. In the European Union the situation is worst in Benelux, northern Italy, and in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution is the cause of multiple respiratory and other diseases. Under Article 152 of the European Community Treaty, public health falls under the purview of the Member States, and the European Union has only limited powers in this regard; hence it is necessary to look for ways to enable the European Union to act indirectly, that is, by means of other policies, in order to improve health. Improving air quality is undoubtedly an example of such policies.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States and, especially, the new Member States for which EU law is still a new legal area and which are facing major economic problems, are required to implement a Framework Directive in their respective legal systems, along with four more pieces of legislation, three daughter directives and a Council Decision, it is clear that implementation will be fraught with difficulties, errors and incompleteness. The public will find it difficult to identify the binding EU standards of air quality. I therefore greatly appreciate the fact that the proposed draft will simplify the existing legislation by as much as 50%. The European Union needs long-term goals, strict controls and checks as to whether the Member States are properly implementing the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the EU should adopt standards that are transparent and that focus more on limiting emissions by polluters. The targets set in the legislation, be it PM10 or PM2.5, or the date on which the Directive will come into force, should be ambitious but realistic. Failing that, we expose ourselves to the risk of non-compliance by the Member States. In this regard it is important to realise that even the most earnest activities on the part of the European Union will be in vain unless the EU is engaged in global cooperation, since air pollution will then be imported, and we will not be in a position to prevent that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An earlier generation was faced with smog and it tackled that with Clean Air Acts, which stopped coal burning in homes, in industries and on railways.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we face the challenge of fine particles and the respiratory and cardiovascular effect that has on our constituents: the extra medication, the millions of lost working days each year and premature deaths. In my constituency, 1 000 people die prematurely as a result of pollution and another 1 000 are sent to hospital. It is now estimated that PM2.5 pollution is responsible for reducing our life expectancy by some eight months. That is the challenge. That is why we need to tackle pollution at source in relation to cars and heavy vehicles, ships, agricultural feed, energy-using products and so forth. However, we also need to tackle it through this directive, simplifying the previous legal instruments while bringing in this new standard for the smaller particles, the 2.5s, because we know those are the most dangerous to human health. We need a robust directive and the Commissioner is right to remind us that we must not go back on things already agreed. My delegation will certainly vote for standards that are challenging, that are effective and that will be implemented sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the two rapporteurs who brought this through the committee to this plenary and I wish the Commissioner well in his work. May I also wish well Mr Sjöstedt, our friend and colleague from the Environment Committee. As he takes his environmental credentials across the ocean, may we hope that he influences the Americans too, to ensure they understand the need for environmental measures of this sort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Air quality is a yardstick for quality of life. Every year in the European Union, over 300 000 people die prematurely as a result of particulates, an intolerable state of affairs that must be brought to an end, and so it is to be welcomed that a strategy is being developed and the directive on air quality and clean air in Europe rolled out.</p>
<p class="contents">The main concern where improvement of air quality is concerned has to do with the limit values for PM10 and PM2.5 particles. On 21 June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety expressed itself in favour of ambitious limit values for these. What is of significance for the EU’s Member States is that not only the limit values for good air quality are defined, but that the means should also be devised for ensuring compliance with them, and I would give the Euro 5 emissions standard for private motor vehicles as an example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the instruments, the time element also plays a vital part in compliance with the limit values; even if more stringent limit values for private motor vehicles are laid down immediately, it will take some time for the number of environmentally-friendly motor vehicles on European roads to increase. The compromises on which we are to vote guarantee more stringent limit values and a realistic time frame, making it possible for the instruments to work and the limit values to be complied with. Laying down ambitious limit values for air quality and developing instruments for ensuring that they are complied with can improve air quality, and hence also quality of life, in Europe for years to come, and that is what we must aim to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must also extend thanks to Mr Jonas Sjöstedt, who, as a shadow rapporteur, worked with me at the end of the negotiations on the Euro 5 standard. I have not been here very long – only ten months – but I can tell you, Jonas, that you have in this time become a dear colleague to me. I wish you much success in your further career, and all the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

London’s air today is still very polluted and is amongst the worst of any city in Europe. EU air pollution limits are significantly exceeded along London’s major road network, in Central London and around Heathrow Airport, where nitrogen dioxide is 50% above the limit, due to a combination of aeroplanes and vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome much that is positive in the new proposals and the Krahmer report, such as the streamlining of the law, greater public accessibility to monitoring results, new limits for fine particulates and stricter ones for other pollutants. However, I am very concerned about the effect in my city of postponing the deadlines, perhaps until 2018 instead of 2010, for hot spots.</p>
<p class="contents">Londoners would be asked to trust the British Government or the Mayor of London to seek postponement when it is genuinely impossible to meet the 2010 deadlines. However, surely it comes down to political will to cut road and air traffic. One barrier between the UK Government and its goal of bulldozing through a third runway at Heathrow is EU air-quality limits, in particular nitrogen dioxide. I fear a long postponement will allow it to wriggle round those limits.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that MEPs are being less progressive than EU governments, at least on the issue of deadlines. It is the first time in seven years in this House that I have found the Council more progressive than the European Parliament. I hope, for the sake of Londoners, that we will stick to deadlines that are as tight as possible.</p>

The poor excuse about certain Member States encountering difficulties in implementing environmental legislation is no longer acceptable, because people’s health is no longer a matter for negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of diseases caused by air pollution is rising on a daily basis. The fact is that it is the authorities that are currently picking up the bill for health care, as the cost of this is not yet integrated into our budgets. What is more, economists estimate that the price of a gallon of oil, which currently stands at USD 3, will have to be increased to USD 10 in order to integrate the cost of health care and climate change. That is what would profoundly change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must not grow weak, Commissioner, on environmental policy, as its cunning game of simplifying and merging the European legal texts would suggest that it has a tendency to do. That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for more binding approaches, particularly in relation to PM 2.5, and for the abolition of the derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat of an environmental disaster that hangs over us, ladies and gentlemen, requires drastic measures, and an example of this comes for once from the United States, where the State of California has provided food for thought by lodging a complaint against the largest car manufacturers for damage to the environment and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words to our dear friend, Mr Sjöstedt. I believe that we are going to miss your perspective on matters at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but we wish you well on the other side of the border, on the other side of the European Union.

I need only say that the cost to the national health of these illnesses exceeds 10% of the gross national product. As far as the derogations are concerned, the best solution would be for there to be none.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to emphasise our support for the relevant amendment, Amendment 73 by Mr Jonas Sjöstedt; if this amendment is rejected, Amendment 54 by Mrs Hassi safeguards the minimum period of time during which derogations will be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">We should emphasise that reducing the upper limit for concentrations of PM2.5 will certainly benefit European citizens. However, recent studies have shown that a reduction in the order of 25 µg/m3 would only reduce premature deaths by 4 500 whereas, if the reduction extended to 15 or 10 µg/m3, as the World Health Organisation proposes, premature deaths would be reduced by 13 000 and 22 000 respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that one of the strongest points of legislation on air quality is that the limit value of 50 µg/m3 for maximum concentrations of PM10 must not be exceeded more than 35 times.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments supporting an increase in the number of days on which the limit may be exceeded from 35 to 55 significantly water down the directive, on the one hand and, on the other hand, do nothing to safeguard protection for public health and on this point I absolutely agree with the Commissioner.</p>

The latter, however, have been implementing methods of reducing emissions of pollutants for a considerable time.</p>
<p class="contents">According to estimates by the Polish Ministry of the Environment, we need an investment in excess of PLN 50 billion if we are to comply with the requirements laid down in the Directive. There would also be a significant increase in social and economic costs. For the poorer social classes, the increased cost of living could neutralise any benefits gained from better air quality. Their standard of living would fall as a result of poor diet, inability to access health care, and inability to maintain basic standards of hygiene, along with other environmental factors contributing to good health.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Cleaner air for Europe’ – other approaches will not deal with the issue in the short term. That is why we are in favour of extending the time period in which the standards are to be met, especially for the new Member States. It is also the reason why we are opposed to stricter conditions for derogations. We shall vote against the restrictive amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a good decision, combined as it is with a statement to the effect that there will be no free rides for those who – even if perhaps not by their own free choice – take no action on this front. The transport industry, for example, is set to grow by 60% over the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone who has spoken today has mentioned the importance of a clean environment, and that is why this does not just concern car manufacturers, but also the builders of heating systems; it has to do with power-generating plant and with loading systems – with, indeed, a really big and wide-ranging area that has to be addressed. The industry must come to understand that standards of this kind are ultimately an opportunity for it to sell modern technology throughout the world, and that is why car industries, and the manufacturers of other industrial equipment as well, must realise that these standards present them, today, with an opportunity to develop new technologies and work at research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will also lead us to ask who, in future, will be researching into better fuels, for renewable fuels are not the only crucial issue; the question also arises of what fuels we are actually using now. If you put that question to the motor industry, the answer you will get is that they are not of high quality, but rather deficient. Heavy demands have been made of the car industry over recent years, but it has always had to run cars on relatively low-quality fuels, and that is something that must change over the next few years. In ten or fifteen years’ time we will be able to drive, using a litre of fuel, five times as far as we do today, and that is what makes innovation and research so significant; that, too, is why demanding environmental standards are called for.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear Jonas, you have been a good colleague and have become a good friend. I wish you all the best for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This principle should be the cornerstone not just of our environmental policy, but of our would-be Constitution as well. People have the right to clean air, and politicians and industrialists have the responsibility to guarantee that right.</p>
<p class="contents">Some decades ago, industry was the main cause of air pollution and the diseases connected with it. With technological changes, industry became less polluting but, as the number of cars increased, the situation did not improve. Eighty per cent of our citizens live in cities and for them the main cause of air pollution is traffic. During the PSE Group hearing on air pollution, we had clear evidence of this. If we want to provide cleaner air for our citizens, we should change our traffic policy in cities.</p>
<p class="contents">In cities with polluted air we have to reduce individual car traffic and improve public transport. The strict pollution reduction targets, as proposed for particulate matter, can only be achieved in that way. That should be the main target, but we also have to reduce dangerous emissions from cars, with cleaner engines, fuels and filters, as indicated in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 proposals. When human lives are at stake, wishful thinking and soft recommendations are not enough. We need binding targets and strict regulations. Annual and daily limit values are also needed. Limit values must be low and strict but, on the other hand, they should reflect reality. It is better to lower them step by step than to set up unrealistic measures and allow them to be ignored.</p>

I am indebted to them all. Mrs Corbey, you are in favour of strict and new source policy. I would like to say to Mrs Breyer and Mrs Hassi that in order to actually meet the air quality standards, we may be able to lay down strict standards on paper, but if we subsequently do not get the opportunity to achieve those technically speaking, then they are of no value. Moreover, the Netherlands is being criticised for wishing to speed up the introduction of soot filters. Well, if all of that is unacceptable, we should not prescribe any strict standards as we cannot meet them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also know, and I am once again addressing Mrs Hassi when I say this – for Mr Blokland and Mr Maaten have said many things with which I am in total agreement – I also know why the Netherlands has voted in favour of this legislation. They did so because it gave them the opportunity of injecting some flexibility into a number of areas. That is the very reason why they voted in favour. What can one see, though, when one compares the Council’s position with that of Parliament? Whilst the Ministers of the Environment may be able to sleep the sleep of the just for having laid down strict standards, they subsequently get home and are faced with an inquiry by the Environmental Agency which concludes that everything that was laid down on paper cannot be achieved at home at any rate.</p>

Our fellow citizens know what effects the quality of the air can have on their health. They are rightly worried when a school is situated near a crossroads with heavy traffic. Parents are demanding that measures in relation to air quality be implemented because they want to know what kind of air their children are breathing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Krahmer report is useful in that it gathers together various texts in just one directive, which should enable us to improve our approach to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore trying to be ambitious faced with this issue of air quality. Yet, in order to know what the quality of the air is, we first have to measure it. That means relying on organisations that are as close to the area as possible, and that are familiar with the geography of the land being studied: they are the neighbourhood networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the displacement of pollution by wind interferes with this. We also know that mountain ranges have a role to play. Pollution moves and reaches areas that are not in themselves sources of pollution. Contrary to what is said in the explanatory statement, high levels of air pollution are not always recorded in densely populated urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">If this European policy is to be clear, however, it must above all be consistent and be part of an integrated approach to combating climate change. It is not enough to set limit values. We also need to know what to do with them. The fight against CO2 emissions is at the heart of the proposed systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to the regulation on motor vehicle emissions, the Euro 5 regulation. The consequences of applying this regulation are already well known. If we solve the emissions problem, on the one hand, we increase CO2 emissions, on the other, and, as we know, CO2 emissions are the cause of climate change. Thus, there are many contradictions in all of that.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to be flexible. There is no use in deciding on strict measures if they cannot be applied in the Member States. We must therefore take as much time as we need. I am specifically thinking about a prevention policy that will hinge on urban transport plans and on the development of clean technologies.</p>

<p class="contents">Of course people want ever cleaner air and a high level of protection. The very same people say, however – and this has been shown in many surveys – that they are not prepared to foot the bill for such a level of protection, and that means that we have to take a balanced view when adopting measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised at the amount of space that the report devotes to agriculture. I sincerely believe that it is far too little for a sector that is increasingly beleaguered and which, moreover, fulfils a number of functions that have a positive effect on the environment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the maritime transport sector, I agree with the aim of achieving a level playing field, but I also believe it is important to work within the International Maritime Organisation to designate the new sulphur emission control areas; otherwise, we shall drive part of the European fleet to register in non-EU countries where controls are virtually non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also have liked to see rather more ambitious measures regarding vehicles, the prime causes of pollution in cities and of dependence on foreign sources of energy. I should like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this, because I believe that cleaner vehicles would dramatically improve air quality in cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is important to continue implementing and developing the directive on the integrated prevention and control of pollution. This directive will allow industries to continue innovating and to control their emissions more effectively, without forcing any plant closures.</p>

My place of work, Brussels, as well as my home, Budapest, both figure among the darkest spots on the map of European air pollution. With regard to suspended particles, for instance, Budapest had already exceeded threshold values within the first four months of the year, and it is not uncommon to see levels rise to 4-5 times the maximum.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been going on for many years, without the least sign of improvement. Yet the harmful effect of fine particles on health is a fact. A European resident loses on average eight months of his or her life as a result. In the case of Budapest’s inhabitants, however, this loss is as high as three years. For this reason, I welcome the new thematic strategy on air pollution, as well as the regulation of fine particles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, regulation does not achieve anything if its enforcement is not guaranteed. We cannot expect local communities to do more than they are really able. But we must expect them to do at least that much. It is obvious that air pollution is strongly influenced by numerous external causes, including the weather, for instance. This does not mean, however, that with proper urban planning and the development of public transport networks, we may not achieve significant improvements. Thus, it is extremely important that only those communities be given extensions on observing the threshold values which have truly made every possible effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that not a single European city should experience what is going on in Budapest today; namely that despite the European obligations in this regard for all these years, the municipal government still does not have a strategy for improving air quality. That is, they do not even have any idea how they might come closer to observing the limits that are so essential for ensuring public health. It seems to me that we have to offer the citizens of Europe a more attractive alternative than the masks that cyclists in China are compelled to wear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a closing remark, I would like to restate the importance of continued action to tackle air pollution. The adverse health impacts, lost economic productivity and damage to environmental quality are still much too great.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have criticised the strategy from one angle, some from another angle. Some consider that the proposed flexibility goes too far, others think that this flexibility is too little. We will be reviewing the strategy to see what progress has been made and how much further we can get towards the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the concern expressed by those who want to see more Community pollution abatement measures so that the strategy’s objective and air quality standards can be met. I think that there is a consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the measures required. In fact, the Commission has already undertaken much of the preparatory work, the fruits of which will be seen in the months to come. As a result, I do not believe that there is any need for an interinstitutional agreement in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments 30 and 81, I understand the concerns of those who call for more flexibility in implementing the existing air quality legislation. However, one cannot have flexibility without weakening the legislation. I think the Commission’s proposal of five years from the entry into force of the limit values strikes the right balance and the Commission cannot support any further weakening beyond that. By way of explanation, according to the Commission proposal, the time extension will go up to the end of 2009; according to the general approach of the Council it will go up to 2010; and according to the rapporteurs’ amendment it will go up to 2013. So there is a difference on this point. It is four years plus two from the entry into force of the new directive. I understand this to be the proposal tabled before this plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments 46 and 82, I should provide some further clarification about the daily limit value of PM10. This protects sensitive individuals against the impact from short-term exposure to particles in the air. It is different from the annual limit value, which provides protection to all from long-term exposure. One cannot simply substitute a more stringent annual limit value for the daily limit. This is what the health experts say. The key to ensuring compliance with both daily and annual limits is to undertake good and timely air quality assessments and to take the necessary steps to reduce emissions. It is clear that many authorities have not done this and now they have compliance problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments 49 and 50, the proposed concentration cap for PM2.5 is set at a level consistent with the stringency of the annual limit value for PM10, which the Commission is not proposing to change. It is also useful to remember that the Commission has proposed two ways of tackling PM2.5: the concentration cap of 25 micrograms per cubic metre and the exposure-reduction approach, where average levels in urban areas will be reduced over ten years. These methods combined will work to deliver health improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our modelling work, which underpins the thematic strategy and the air quality proposal, shows that greater health improvements can be obtained by allowing the Member States to choose where to reduce pollution levels. This is the aim of the exposure reduction targets. This flexibility will be limited if the concentration cap forces Member States to divert resources to ensure compliance in some specific hotspot regions, where few health improvements may be available.
