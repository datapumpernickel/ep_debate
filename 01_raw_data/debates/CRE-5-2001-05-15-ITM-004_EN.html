<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Breyer (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal is based on the common position adopted by the Council for a water framework directive. The common position made no provision either for identification of ‘priority hazardous substances’ or for the gradual elimination of pollution of waters by hazardous substances. We must emphasise once again that the European Parliament deserves credit for ensuring that the OSPAR strategy will be integrated into the water framework directive. Parliament insisted on integration being treated as a key issue in the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to eliminate water pollution gradually, by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, leakage and spillage of priority hazardous substances with the target of complete elimination within 20 years. Under the water directive, the criteria for the identification of such substances focus firstly on their inherent characteristics and secondly on the definitions contained in the existing international, UN, OSPAR and other lists.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 32 substances to which the priority classification has been assigned, the proposal lists eleven as priority hazardous substances, a further eleven as priority substances under review and the remaining ten as regular priority substances. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that the Commission undertake the categorisation of the eleven substances on the ‘under review’ list in the course of the coming year. In this way the Environment Committee seeks to ensure that the Commission does not defer its decision as to whether these eleven substances are priority hazardous substances or only priority substances until the year 2004, when, under Article 16 of the water framework directive, the lists of priority substances are due for revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this proposal, the Environment Committee also wants to ensure that Article 16 is actually applied and that the decision on the categorisation of the substances on the ‘under review’ list is not shelved in deference to industrial or other interests. I believe it is crucially important that we the European Parliament should exert due pressure on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we must always bear in mind is that this report only serves to pave the way for the necessary measures and that the framework directive lays down a 20-year time frame for the achievement of the environmental targets in the realm of water protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee also wants to see changes in the COMMPS procedure. This should be continually developed and improved. In future it should no longer be confined to particular substances. For example, it has not hitherto covered those substances for which no data are available at Community level from national monitoring programmes. This applies to 60% of the pesticides that are available today. Parliament wishes to rectify these serious deficiencies as well as other shortcomings of the present COMMPS procedure, so as to ensure that all substances will be covered in the future. Many of the current deficiencies are due to the fact that our policymakers have no data on certain chemicals. If we wish to protect our waters effectively against hazardous chemicals, we also need a change of policy on the acquisition of data regarding chemical substances. The Commission, in fact, has already set this in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">So you will see that we are striving to reach a solution which the House as well as the Council and Commission will support. The central issue in this discussion will be the results of the categorisation of the substances on the ‘under review’ list. The Committee wishes this categorisation to be effected as soon as possible, as I have already stated. The Commission and the Council see a feasibility problem. That is why I, as rapporteur, have tabled Amendment No 27, in a further attempt to provide the basis for a solution. The proposal is that the measures should not be jeopardised by this ‘under review’ list that the Commission is introducing. This, I believe, is our common objective. This proposal must not be pushed towards the rear of the catalogue of implementable measures, a move which would prevent us from achieving the environmental aims we have to achieve in order to protect our water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the talks that have taken place between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I hope we have now found a sound compromise, which will enable us to conclude this matter at first reading. In other words, it is now up to the Council and the Commission to decide whether they will abide by the outcome of the parliamentary vote, thereby enabling us to start as quickly as possible to introduce real measures for the protection of water resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, however, disappointed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept our amendments that substances in natural nutrients used in agriculture should not be classified either as priority or hazardous priority substances. The Committee on the Environment also did not accept our Amendment No 3 which was to review the procedure for priority hazardous substances. The plant protection products Directive 91/414 already has an established procedure to evaluate those substances and decide whether or not they should be used in the Community. I would submit that the decisions under that Directive ought to be completed under its agreed timetable before an informed decision can be taken under these new proposals. There is no valid reason, given that we are looking at a potential phase-out period of twenty years, for trying to shorten the timetable, and this was the substance of the Committee on Agriculture's proposal. We wanted to allow sufficient time to have a thorough investigation and make sure there was an avoidance of errors. The original Commission proposal was barely in line. Amendment No 20 by the committee and Amendment No 27 by Mrs Breyer run counter to proper investigation and should be opposed. Mrs Breyer ought to have mentioned when she was talking about Amendment No 27 that she was speaking about an amendment tabled by herself on behalf of her group and not on behalf of the Committee on the Environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these amendments, Amendment No 3, relates to one of the major innovations in the Commission’s proposal, namely the management of European water resources using river basins and watercourses that irrigate the European Union’s territory. On this point, Parliament insists that the Commission take into account the fact that many watercourses and even rivers, such as the Tagus in southern Europe, the Rhine, for instance, in central Europe or the Oder, for example, in northern Europe, are border rivers which are the responsibility of one or more Member States but also of riparian States which are not Member States and, in particular, candidate countries. Parliament believes that it is crucial that these non-Member riparian States should be involved in the management process now rather than waiting until they join the EU, which is very likely but will inevitably not happen for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">A second amendment, Amendment No 8, calls upon the Commission to promote the synchronisation of research and of the conclusions drawn within the framework of the two major mechanisms for combating water pollution that have already been implemented. The first mechanism is the OSPAR Convention, which focuses on maritime waters but also covers a considerable area of internal waters. The second mechanism, known as the COMMPS procedure, focuses, on the other hand, on internal waters but also covers a substantial area of maritime waters. In these circumstances, it is easy to understand that the situation could well become chaotic if the Commission does not provide the requested synchronisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third amendment, Amendment No 11, expresses the desire that the Commission, whilst following the COMMPS procedure as a general rule, should not exclude the possibility of the Commission using methods of assessing the harmfulness of certain substances which have already been developed or used in other anti-pollution measures. For instance, measures which have already proven to be effective in systems developed for combating air pollution must be used or adapted for combating water pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a final comment, which is to stress the extraordinarily far-reaching importance of the texts submitted for vote by Parliament. One of the reasons why Europe has shown exemplary development across the board, one of the reasons for this balanced development and for the high quality farming industry which has always accompanied Europe’s economic development is precisely the fact that Europe has always had inexhaustible – in that they are infinitely renewable – resources of the precious liquid which keeps us alive. Both the quality and the quantity of water resources are now at risk from senseless and rapidly increasing amounts of pollution, which has been virtually uncontrollable over the last few centuries. All Member States and all regions must take action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the European Peoples’ Party is in agreement with the proposal from the Commission. All the amendments supported by our group help to bring the text of the annex into line with that of the Water Framework Directive. The rapid adoption of this list is a matter of priority for our group, because only then will the Commission be able to get down to its main task of formulating proposals for the treatment of every single one of these 32 substances.</p>
<p class="contents">This can then mean banning substances and phasing them out or permitting their continued use, subject to certain conditions. The aim, however, is always the same, namely either not to let these substances enter water at all in future or only to let them enter water in weak concentrations. The concept of water in the context of the directive covers all water – groundwater, surface water, rivers and lakes, right down to the smallest stream and even perhaps the smallest puddle, and, of course, the sea. It goes without saying that this wide range of aquatic environments will require widely differing sets of rules. After all, we are not starting from scratch here in Europe, because many of these 32 substances are already covered by the Directive on plant-protection products, the Biocides Directive and the Directive on existing substances. Moreover, when the entire body of EU legislation on chemical substances is realigned, we shall be compelled to subject all these substances to thorough scrutiny once again. For this reason we should take great care to ensure that there is no duplication of effort, and hence unnecessary expense. We can spend the money more fruitfully elsewhere for the benefit of the environment. Our aim here is to determine the impact of these substances on our water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned that the Swedish Presidency is keen to have this matter concluded swiftly. We intend to support its pursuit of that goal. Our group will not stand in its way. Anyone who is seriously committed to the protection of our European waters should adopt the same position. Mrs Breyer has already stressed a point that I should like to re-emphasise, namely that Parliament has achieved a resounding success in the creation of the Water Framework Directive and that its fruits are already being harvested today. After all, its classification of eleven substances out of the 32 as priority hazardous substances has ensured that their discharge into water resources will be stopped within the foreseeable future.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowe (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I must first of all welcome this report. It has taken some time to get it to the plenary session. Mrs Breyer has been persistent, though, and she has worked very hard on it. So I think we can now give it our general support and endorse entirely the principles of what is being proposed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">This priority list of thirty-two proposed substances, ranked according to their known dangerous properties, is the right way to start trying to deal with the problem of water pollution. However, we also need to consider the possibility of adding to this list or simply changing it using the COMMPS procedure or using other additional information we might obtain in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have to consider this list very carefully before action, but that is not an excuse for no action or slow action. It is still bizarre to me that nickel is included on this list and that our approach to families of chemicals has unfairly targeted fluoranthene alongside the other PAHs. So, clearly further work is needed on this initial list. The timetable for action is not really ambitious. 2020? I really think that perhaps we can go a little faster than that.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of getting close to zero emissions of these substances is a fairly vague objective and I think some of the European Parliament's amendments today help to clarify this issue. But I do not doubt for one minute that this is the way ahead, that these are the steps we have got to take to protect an increasingly important resource, the quality of which is vital to future generations. This is a blessing they do not have in other parts of the world. In Europe we should count our blessings and care for our blessings; our water resources are one of those very important blessings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is not all gloom and doom, and within Europe, we are capable of banning the use of chemicals which are toxic, persistent and bio-accumulative and using science to develop safer alternatives, and this directive is good news for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The Water Framework Directive was my first experience of the dynamics of the conciliation process between Parliament and the Council with the assistance of the Commission, and I think that Parliament can claim credit for introducing the category of priority hazardous substances which this Directive now puts into practice, but it is indeed a first step on a long road. I know the Commissioner has herself many times referred to the sheer number of chemicals still being developed and being put on the market, and suspicion is attached to many substances, not identified as yet, and the process of identification and elimination needs to progress rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I refer in concluding to the institutional relationship? The Presidency has indicated to group spokesmen that it would like to fast-track this process and see a rapid resolution, and I think that is welcomed by all parties. We would obviously like to see action sooner rather than later, but hastily arranged meetings with no time for proper discussion and coordination between parties are not the best way of making laws or securing agreement so I hope we succeed and are able to achieve a vote today which the Council can endorse within a matter of weeks rather than years; but if we do, I suspect that it will be more a matter of luck than design, and I hope we can bear this in mind if we are able to work together with the other institutions of the European Union and achieve progress more effectively and rapidly in future years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we take the background emissions into account, this will indeed be impossible. In addition, in the case of natural gas extraction, for example, a small amount of mercury always ends up in the water. Therefore, if mercury is earmarked as a priority hazardous substance, it will be impossible to extract any natural gas in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears preferable to me to have a list of hazardous priority substances, the emission levels of which are reduced by 95% to 99%, than to have just one substance whose emission levels are reduced by 100%. If the objective of reducing emission levels by 100% is upheld, it will in fact be impossible to identify priority hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have already criticised the method used for drafting a list of priority substances in water. The advantage of this method is speed, but this is counteracted by the fact that a great deal of information was missing at the assessment stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly with regard to metals, the outcome of the method applied can be called into question. Nickel is on the list because, in January 1990, it was marked as carcinogenic if it is inhaled in powder form. However, this was never proven with regard to nickel in water. It would be preferable to await the outcome of an extensive study into nickel in water, currently being carried out in Denmark. Furthermore, there are more indications that other metals should be placed on the list of priority substances, such as copper and arsenic.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate how difficult it is to assess metals effectively, since the conditions which affect metals to a large extent, such as hardness and acidity, can vary greatly in the European Union. Maybe we should therefore opt for a regional, rather than a European, approach as far as metals are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, in order to meet the objective of sound water quality, the Framework Directive is not sufficient, and there is, therefore, a Commission proposal before us to draft a list of priority substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to begin by saying that I welcome the Commission proposal and Mrs Breyer’s report with open arms. The list will be a good, first step on the road to the excellent quality of our water. I therefore share Mrs Breyer’s view that, if we want to live up to the obligation under the Directive, we may not, or cannot, make concessions on socio-economic grounds. Neither can we, or should we, allow ourselves to be guided by the fact that certain hazardous substances naturally occur in European water.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make some observations with regard to three substances. I do so as a Dutch person, someone who also wants to be mindful of the fact that our surface water, from the Maas, for example, has to be turned into drinking water at the same time. There are three substances which I would highlight and would like to see included amongst the priority substances to be assessed: namely dyron, isoprothyron and symosyne. In fact, a recent study of European drinking water and water treatment plants has shown that, due to pollution of drinking water sources by pesticides, the concentration levels of these substances in our water are far too high in Europe, and that puts enormous pressure on the supply of drinking water. In my country, it is often the case that wells or springs, or the storage facility in the Biesbosch, have to be closed down.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission is willing to adopt the amendments that we have tabled in this respect, and I also make an urgent appeal to the Council to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us push this through as quickly as possible, I thought, so that it can be implemented without delay. However, when I examined the proposal more closely, I discovered that there was a third category. Alongside priority hazardous substances and regular hazardous substances, we also have the ‘three-star’ category. The Commission evidently has reason to believe that these may be priority hazardous substances but is not sure whether they should be classified as such at this stage. The introduction of a ‘three-star’ category, Commissioner, is surely inconsistent with the Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must press for the removal of this ‘three-star’ category as soon as possible. Either they are priority hazardous substances and must be phased out or they are not. We cannot accept this intermediate category. It covers substances for which there are real indications of serious risk, as in the cases of lead, lead compounds and some herbicides and pesticides. The Commission clearly has certain grounds for assuming, Commissioner, that these may belong to the category of priority hazardous substances. For that reason, the Commission must eliminate this ‘three-star’ category as soon as possible. It is my view that this must be done before the normal review date. Now whether this means that it must be eliminated by 1 July 2002, as specified in the decision we adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, or whether the Commission must table a draft containing supplementary provisions as soon as possible is a question that may be left open for the moment. The crux of the matter is that the ‘three-star’ category must disappear before the review.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, may I ask the Commissioner directly whether she can guarantee that the Commission will deliver a final decision on the ‘three-star’ category as soon as possible, in other words during its present term of office, so that the Council and Parliament can affix their legislative seal of approval? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the list of hazardous priority substances appearing in the annex of the Commission’s proposal should not be altered, and it is necessary to keep it as the Commission drew it up. In order to achieve a consensus with regard to classification, cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council is, of course, essential. In my opinion, only on the basis of the work carried out by the Commission in this field will we be able to create a system of classification which applies clear and comprehensible criteria for the identification of substances.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all agreed on the desire to eradicate water pollution as soon as possible and to this end we must implement a double strategy: in the international field, the ratification of international commitments, especially the OSPAR and COMMPS conventions, although we do not consider it appropriate to expressly mention these agreements in the text of the proposal; at the level of the Member States, to guarantee that the Commission be provided with the necessary means for it to have exact knowledge of the situation of our water masses, so that it can monitor, in a detailed and constant way, the comparable situation between Member States in terms of the development of the quality of our waters. Furthermore, it is important to encourage the future Member States of the Union to combat pollution by taking on board the European objectives, especially those countries which share river basins with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight the exceptional circumstances of certain substances, such as Cadmium and Mercury, whose complete eradication is not possible at the moment, as indicated in Amendment No 2 of the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Money must be targeted where it will have the most beneficial environmental impact. Therefore I welcome this attempt to prioritise substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Testing techniques are becoming more sensitive. Minuscule levels of contamination can be detected. It is therefore unrealistic to talk about elimination or cessation or even 'close to zero'. What does 'close to zero' mean, one, two, who knows? Threshold levels must be set with regard to human health, not using abstract concepts. Secondly, the United Kingdom has a specific problem regarding the categorisation of fluoranthene, which is one of the family of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the top category. We have one hundred thousand kilometres of cast-iron water-pipes lined with coal-tar, which contains some fluoranthene. No-one is suggesting that the levels present are a risk to health, but these pipes will have to be re-lined unless fluoranthene can be moved into the 'under review' part of the list, along with the other PAHs like naphthalene and anthrocene all of which, incidentally, the COMMPS procedure has found to be less toxic than fluoranthene.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a waste of resources to have to replace or reline all these water-pipes on the basis of this priority list when the resources could be better deployed in areas of real concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission has amended its proposal so that, by means of a group of experts, the priority hazardous substances should firstly be identified, and secondly a revision clause should introduced which would apply to some of them and, thirdly, the terminology and final text should be adapted. Of the 32 priority substances identified, 11 are proposed as priority hazardous substances, 11 more as priority substances under investigation – all of this within 4 years of the entry into force of the framework directive. There is no data on the toxicity, persistence or bioaccumulation of the remaining 10 substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose three amendments should be supported, points out that natural nutrients should not be classed as priority hazardous substances and, on the issue of plant protection products, there is already an established procedure: Directive 91/414, which should be respected, as well as the decision that it must be adapted at the same time, not before and not later.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the different definitions should be reorganised, such as the hydrographical district or the management of those districts, since that would prevent the various regulations from having differing effects on the same territories and problems, which could happen on applying the DMA, the COMMPS and the OSPAR agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is less than a year ago that we reached an agreement on a new European water policy, and the decision that we are discussing today is an important first step in substantiating the Water Framework Directive. I am sure that we can agree that one of the main achievements of this directive during conciliation was to make the central political commitments of the OSPAR Convention legally binding and operational. This major success of the European Parliament has within a very short time introduced this visionary objective of a long-term protection of sensitive marine eco-systems into our Community policy. It has always been my position that the Commission is committed to coming forward with specific proposals for measures for priority and priority hazardous substances, and I have done everything possible to allow this to be put in place as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 January this year the Commission presented its proposal for the list of priority substances, including priority hazardous substances, only three weeks after the Water Framework Directive came into force. Despite this short time frame I believe that the Commission was able to come up with an amended proposal which is ambitious and balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me directly to the key issue under discussion in the Committee on the Environment. The identification of the priority hazardous substances and the introduction of a review clause has been discussed intensively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also discuss this list in a more general way, without referring to it substance by substance. The proposed list is not designed for eternity. In fact the Water Framework Directive speaks of a dynamic process which foresees a review of the list, including the identification of priority hazardous substances, every four years at the latest. This implies that the procedure for selection will be continuously improved and the scientific evidence as well as other developments will be taken on board. Indeed the guidelines you have suggested in several amendments will help us to move in the right direction. We will naturally take into account the scientific assessments that are under preparation under various Community instruments at the moment. Thus we must ensure that the substances that we identify as priority hazardous are based on the same criteria and thresholds in both the water and the chemicals policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that Amendments Nos 20 and 27 propose to reduce the deadline for the specific review to 1 July 2002 or one year after adoption of the list. This is a very short time frame and will be extremely challenging, in particular because some of the scientific assessments might not be completely finalised by then, and I do not want to commit myself to unrealistic deadlines. Mr Lange asked me if I could guarantee a review of the list during my term of office. Yes, I reiterate my commitment to this, but the twelve months might be too tight, thus leading to insufficient quality of this first review and I am not interested in that.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I am committed to improving the dynamic instrument for setting priorities and identifying priority hazardous substances, in particular substances of concern that may emerge from other relevant Community initiatives and international agreements in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission is reluctant to accept Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19, as those three substances would not fulfil all the criteria. At the same time the proposed selection of these plant protection products as priority substances will ensure the sustainable protection of drinking water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the deadline for a review of certain priority substances, I reiterate my commitment to review the list as soon as possible. However, Amendments Nos 20 and 27 in their current wording impose too tight a framework for achieving the quality of work that I consider indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked about the candidate countries' involvement, and this is a crucial issue for me. Following my initiative, the Member States and the Commission agreed two weeks ago on a common implementation strategy for the Water Framework Directive. The implementation efforts will not only involve all stakeholders but also candidate countries, just as the meeting two weeks ago involved not only the water directors of Member States and the Commission but also those from candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the other proposed amendments on the recitals and the articles. I can accept these amendments as long as they are in line with the Water Framework Directive. I can accept Amendments Nos 2 to 6, 8 to 11, 13, 15, 21 to 23 and 26. In addition I can accept in part Amendments Nos 12, 16 and 25 and in principle Amendments Nos 1, 7, 24, 28 and 29. I do not accept Amendment No 14 because it is fully and more precisely covered by Amendment No 13.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to say that it is in the Commission's interests that measures for these substances are taken swiftly. Following adoption of this list I will ensure that the ensuing work on measures for phasing out emissions, discharges and losses of priority hazardous substances is carried out according to the environmental objectives and timetable set out in the directive. My services have already started preparatory work on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am seeking your support for this work and I sincerely hope that we show the same speed and determination in the implementation of the new Water Framework Directive for the benefit of the aquatic environment in Europe.</p>
