<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Tsatsos and myself have produced is based on very clear political criteria. Firstly, Parliament must support its delegation in the Convention, which has achieved a good text, an intelligent text, although naturally it is not a perfect text, because no legal text is perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not therefore believe that we need to make proposals to modify this text; we understand that many Members would have liked to have called for improvements on various points, but our approach has been that we should not call for any, but that we should ask the Heads of State or Government not to substantially undo or alter the broad consensus achieved in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not dealing with mere preparatory work, but with an expression of solutions supported by national parliaments and the European Parliament – which represents the citizens of Europe – and by representatives of the governments and the Member States. I repeat: we are dealing with a political consensus which must not be undervalued or sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, on certain points, ladies and gentlemen, some governments and the Commission have expressed reservations. It would be naïve to imagine that these extremely important political problems are not going to be dealt with by the Intergovernmental Conference, or that that Conference will simply rubberstamp what the Convention has done. Those people who maintain this position are naturally expressing an initial negotiating position because, otherwise, we would have to assume they have their heads in the clouds.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced, ladies and gentlemen – and I am obviously speaking on a personal basis and not as rapporteur – that the system according to which only half of the Commissioners would vote would be a crass error. That solution would weaken the Commission at a time when it most needs to be strengthened. This is an error which must be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say equally clearly that it will not be possible to alter the balance of power established in Nice, so that just one or two States pay the price for a new decision-making method. In the Union, consensus can be changed, of course, but on one condition: that the interests of everybody are brought together. Otherwise, new consensus cannot be achieved. A consensus is replaced by another consensus, not by impositions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report intends to stress that dealing with and resolving these specific issues will be legitimate provided that we thereby improve the democratic consensus achieved so far. This, however, must not be a reason for reopening the constitutional negotiations, as if we were weaving Penelope’s shroud. I would say to the Heads of State or Government that that would be a great error.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the main political message of our report, but we had to go further than that, of course. It was necessary to evaluate the ins and outs of the draft Constitution so that the citizens can express their opinion on it when the time comes and so that it may be clear that the European Parliament accepts and supports this draft as a compromise, a realistic negotiated position between the ideal solutions it has been advocating and the possibilities for putting them into practice at this time. We are not abandoning those goals. We are making it clear that the draft represents a step forward, an important step, but we are not giving up the idea of making further progress when the time is right.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not like to end this brief speech without thanking my co-rapporteur, Professor Tsatsos, for his exemplary will to achieve consensus and the high intellectual quality of his contribution to achieving it. I would also like to thank all our fellow Members from the different groups for their extremely valuable contributions and their sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that we have been able to work with such a high degree of consensus because Parliament's representation in the Convention – in agreement with the national parliaments – did such a significant job achieving the consensus on the basis of which we have been able to continue to build.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mentioned this Parliament’s sense of responsibility. Parliament usually demonstrates this sense of responsibility when it comes to taking political decisions of truly great importance. Since it was elected by universal suffrage, that sense of responsibility has turned it into the Union's driving force. I have seen this during successive Intergovernmental Conferences, some of which I have participated in very directly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit of integration, construction and genuine Europeanism, that I am hopeful that the House will vote in favour of our report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tsatsos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history means development. That is why, with the work of the Convention, the constitutional history of the European Union has started to unroll.</p>
<p class="contents">In the draft which we are submitting to you, my distinguished and respected colleague, Mr Gil-Robles, and I propose that the European Parliament take the following three positions:</p>
<p class="contents">First position: Parliament claims recognition of the institution of the Convention as its victory and as <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The preparation of the revision of the Treaties is the work of a political body for the first time in history of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Second position: despite the imperfections and shortcomings in the Convention's draft, the European Parliament, as Mr Gil-Robles stressed, is calling for the Intergovernmental Conference not to reopen the package of basic compromises reached in it. If, on the contrary, the Intergovernmental Conference distances itself politically from the draft, it will damage our institutional victory and the result of the revision will not, I fear, differ from the Nice fiasco. Of course, there are also reasons relating to the content of the draft that impose respect for the compromise reached. For example, fundamental rights, safeguarding the basic values of the European Union, the social state, culminating in the objective of full employment, the upgrading of the European Parliament, the constitutionalisation and simplification of the content of the Treaties, the increased safeguarding of transparency, making full use of the national parliaments, the extension of qualified majority voting and much more besides.</p>
<p class="contents">Third position: the Convention's draft constitution also has serious weaknesses, as my respected friend, Mr Gil-Robles, emphasised. For example: first, the institution of the President of the European Council does not leave the balance between the institutions or the functioning of the European Commission or the parity between the states untouched. It is an institution with a democratic deficit and the corresponding abolition of the revolving presidency damages the parity between the states. Secondly, the constitution of the Commission with 25 commissioners divided, to put it one way, into full and second-class commissioners, is – if you will pardon the expression – a monster in the making. The attempt to extort a ‘yes’ to the introduction of the institution of the President of the European Council by offering more, albeit second-class, commissioners is clear here. Thirdly, it proved impossible to take substantial steps on a foreign policy and security policy which would allow the European Union to restore its political credibility internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, both ‘yes’ and criticism? Perhaps that is a contradiction? I believe it is not a contradiction for three reasons. First reason: constitutional texts are not static. They are based on concepts such as freedom, democracy, fundamental rights, equality, the rule of law, the social state, in other words concepts, the content of which undergoes permanent historic development through political and social struggle. Our criticism should be seen as a contribution to this development. Second reason: the European Parliament, should these compromises be reopened, must have submitted its views. Third reason: we are not calling on the European citizens to support the constitutional text because they will be ignorant of its drawbacks, but in knowledge of its drawbacks and for reasons of its advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Two amendments have been proposed in a bid to expressly emphasise the Christian character of the historic roots of the European Union. By its very nature, this is an historic, philosophic and moral issue with a metaphysical basis which therefore concerns each and every one of us. That is why, to finish, I dare to take a personal stand: I recognise the determining role of Christianity in shaping European civilisation, I recognise the need to safeguard the validity of its teachings; however, it would diminish Christianity and underestimate its persuasiveness if we were to accept that it needs constitutional support. That is why I am voting against urging that the Intergovernmental Conference safeguard it constitutionally.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I wish the Constitution a long, safe journey. I wish it luck in times of storm. I believe that its first port of call should be to restore its political credibility, the political credibility of the European Union. That is what was so badly damaged by the alliance between certain of its members and the United States, who must bear the burden of the illegal invasion of Iraq on the pretext of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I warmly thank my respected rapporteur and chairman, Mr Gil-Robles, the committee's excellent secretariat and all those who cooperated with us.</p>

<p class="contents">Thanks, not least, to the essential contribution made by representatives of Parliament, the Convention has written an historic page in the process of European integration. For the first time, the European Union’s institutions, the governments of the Member States and of the accession countries, the national parliaments and civil society have all taken part in a structured, all-embracing, public and transparent debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has successfully accomplished a gargantuan task within the timeframe set by the Laeken Declaration, achieving substantial consensus on crucial points that had not been resolved during previous Intergovernmental Conferences, such as the division of competences, the conferring of a legal personality on the Union, replacement of the pillar structure of the previous Treaty, strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity, clearer definition of the hierarchy of the Union’s legislative acts, the involvement of national parliaments and a new institutional balance of powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention also demonstrated that it is possible to prepare and negotiate European treaties in an entirely new way. The success of the new method is shown by the fact that efforts to reconcile the positions of all the parties involved on the most controversial points were being made up until the very last day.</p>
<p class="contents">The final outcome was the drawing-up of a draft Constitutional Treaty that has the merit of gathering proposals and suggestions from all parts of European political and civil society, on the basis of an ambitious plan to bridge the differences that had emerged at previous Intergovernmental Conferences between countries with larger populations and countries with smaller populations and between countries which varied in their readiness to proceed towards even greater integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments will now have the final word, in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty. That fact must not, however, make us forget that this is a single constituent process, the first stage of which has come to an end with the Convention; the process is now entering the stage of intergovernmental negotiation and will, we hope, end with the ratification of the future Constitutional Treaty. In essence, then, this is a different kind of negotiation process from that which preceded the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. We will have to take this into account when defining the organisational and procedural aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In conducting the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, starting on 4 October, the Italian Presidency’s primary aim will be to keep to the timetable drawn up at the Thessaloniki European Council. This means pressing ahead determinedly to achieve a positive result in time for the European Parliament elections to be held in June next year.</p>
<p class="contents">This groundplan has dictated one of the Italian Presidency’s main objectives: to conduct the Intergovernmental Conference at a high political level and to a tight schedule so as to reach a comprehensive overall agreement on the constitutional text by December. It would thus be possible for the Constitutional Treaty – a Constitution for Europe, as President Giscard d’Estaing has described it – to be signed between 1 May 2004, the date set for the entry of the ten new Member States, and the European Parliament elections. Prolonging the negotiations on the Constitution beyond these dates would result in two serious problems of democratic legitimacy and transparency: on the one hand the constitutional legacy of the Convention would gradually be lost, and, on the other, the citizens of Europe would be voting in the European Parliament elections without knowing what the constitutional shape of the future Union would be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency therefore intends to safeguard the structure and balance of the draft produced by the Convention. Parliament’s opinion, in the text approved to date by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has provided valuable support for our efforts, as have the speeches given by the rapporteurs who spoke before me and strongly confirmed this intention.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already expressed our views on the inappropriateness of reopening debates that have already been thrashed out in the Convention; revisiting them could only lead to less consensual and less ambitious results. The Intergovernmental Conference must not, therefore, change the overall structure and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty but will, instead, be called upon to improve and add to those parts of the text that need clarifying, completing or supplementing, all with the greatest transparency and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to achieve a quality result that both meets the expectations of European public opinion and can ensure that the enlarged Union operates effectively and democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving the European Union a Constitution is a challenge, and not just for certain Member States or for the Italian Presidency, whose task it is to steer the Council through this phase. It is a challenge for everybody. It is a commitment to our citizens: if we do not succeed in this challenge, as Mr Frattini said to his fellow ministers at Riva del Garda, it will be a defeat for the Union as a whole and a serious setback in terms of our goal of making Europe a respected leader on the world stage as a force for peace, democracy, stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not disguise the fact that the final outcome is not at all a foregone conclusion: the process might reach a deadlock or even break down. I should like to make it quite clear, in this regard, that the Italian Presidency is not willing to make any compromises that do not abide by the spirit of the key elements of the draft produced by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Presidency believes that greater involvement of the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference’s work is essential in order to safeguard the constitutional legacy of the Convention and to avoid falling back into the narrow, nationalistic ways of thinking that produced the obscure agreements at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament took part in the group of personal representatives, where it made a constructive and much-appreciated contribution. The Italian Presidency feels that, since preparatory technical working groups will not be formally set up this time, it makes sense for Parliament to be fully involved in the Intergovernmental Conference meetings at Foreign Minister level.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the meetings of Heads of State or Government, the Italian Presidency undertakes to make every effort to secure agreement on ways of involving the President of Parliament much more and of keeping him much better informed than at previous Intergovernmental Conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Riva del Garda talks did not result in agreed guidelines on this matter. The Heads of State or Government will therefore have to come to a decision on it themselves when the Intergovernmental Conference opens. At that time, the Italian Presidency will work along the lines that I have just sketched out for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are on the eve of a fundamentally important event in the history of European integration. The Italian Government is aware of the role that Parliament has played over the last two decades to achieve a more democratic, more cohesive and fairer Union. It was the Spinelli draft Treaty that reinvigorated that process of European integration which – through the Single Act and the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice – has led to the completion of the single market, the adoption of the euro, and the ever greater sharing of sovereignty in the fields of foreign policy, justice and home affairs. At the same time, your Parliament, speaking directly for the peoples of the Union, has taken on ever greater and more effective colegislative and monitoring powers. Your support will therefore be crucial in the coming months, which will see the enlarged Europe enter its constitutional phase, the crowning point of the long process that was begun by the founding fathers with the Treaties of Paris and Rome and which should lead us to ever closer union between our states and our citizens. This tradition of a shared understanding strengthens the Italian Presidency’s determination to stay in constant contact with the European Parliament: in this spirit, the President of the Republic, Mr Ciampi, will be addressing you next week to express once again the firm belief in Europe that is the joint heritage of all the main political, economic, social and cultural forces in Italy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, together with my friend and colleague Mr Antonio Vitorino, I had the privilege of taking part in all of the work of the Præsidium of the Convention, alongside Mr Klaus Hänsch and Mr Íñigo Méndez de Vigo. We have worked hard together for the last 18 months. I am sure you will allow me to thank them personally and in public, as this is my first opportunity to address Parliament since the work of the Convention was concluded. I should also like to say how grateful I am for the work of all those Members of the European Parliament who served as Conventioneers. Thanks are due too to their deputies and to others who supported them. The oversight exercised by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, under the chairmanship of Mr Giorgio Napolitano, must also be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as was stated a few moments ago, the Convention has now finished its work. It has fulfilled its contract. There is, however, no time for nostalgia. Furthermore, nostalgia is not a good guide in politics, in my opinion. As of today, the Commission and Parliament must again work together in approaching the very sensitive period of the imminent Intergovernmental Conference. We must work just as hard as in the past and face future challenges together. Mr President, I hope the IGC will draft a new and genuine Treaty of Rome. At the end of the Conference, Parliament and the Commission must again work shoulder to shoulder to ensure the text is ratified. This final stage represents a considerable challenge. It entails the citizens or their representatives in each Member State appropriating the text, if I may put it like that.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to reiterate my support for the idea that, when the time comes, the future European Constitution should be ratified on the same day across Europe. Ratification would of course take place in accordance with the specific procedures of each of the Member States. At the same time, a single European ratification day would generate a truly European debate, instead of 25 national debates all taking place alongside each other. This could be a first. It is with this in mind that I come amongst you in the House today, to attend the debate on the report by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said just now, the latest IGC is about to start. It is not, cannot and will not be like previous IGCs. It will not be comparable to the Amsterdam or Nice Conferences. I was deeply involved in those Conferences. They resulted in a measure of progress, but also in many regrets. This IGC is different because it has the chance of building on the in-depth groundwork undertaken by the Convention. Mr Gil-Robles termed this work intelligent and I agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">As a first point of agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I would like to stress that we both want to ensure that this IGC does not revisit issues on which agreement was reached in the Convention. Further, as you said a moment ago, Mr President, the important balances achieved in the draft Constitution must not be disturbed. The second point on which we agree is on what was accepted at the Convention. Briefly, this means that the values, principles, institutions and even, at the request of the Parliamentary conventioneers, the symbols of the European Union are to be enshrined in the Constitution. It also implies the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to which Parliament made a significant contribution. Further, it implies establishing the unique legal personality of the European Union and doing away with the pillar structure. There is also the hierarchy of rules. Other elements are clearer delimitation of the competences of the European Union and the extension of the application of the Community and codecision procedures. Another point of consensus is the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament. Genuine progress was made in the implementation of an area of freedom, security and justice. Real advances were made too in the field of defence. I hope they will be retained. In this regard, I have had the privilege of chairing the Convention group on defence. In particular, we worked on a proposal for a European Armaments Agency and on a draft Solidarity Clause that would allow for mutual assistance in response to a terrorist attack like the one on 11 September that had such tragic consequences for New York and Washington. Attacks of this nature are always a possibility. We also worked on the creation of the post of Foreign Minister of the European Union. This would make up for what the European Union currently lacks, namely a space where a common diplomatic culture can be patiently nurtured. In the event of crises, Europe would then be able to adopt common positions, based on a common geostrategic assessment. I would remind you of the crisis in Yugoslavia and, more recently, the one in Iraq. These are some of the main achievements enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also agree on what is lacking in this Constitution. To quote Professor Tsatsos, we agree on the progress we still need to make and that we must work together to that end. For instance, this draft Constitution does not really reduce the fields where the requirement for unanimity paralyses and will in future continue to paralyse common action. It does not equip the European Union with the instruments and procedures it needs in the key field of economic governance, as is evident at present. The Constitution does not provide for the less crucial of its provisions to be revised in a more flexible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as you are aware, the Commission has considered those provisions of the draft Constitution with implications for its own composition. It wished to propose a better composition than that which currently appears in the text of the Convention. Your two rapporteurs, Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos, spoke along these lines on the issue of the composition of the Commission a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, very many of us here today experienced a sort of enthusiasm throughout these last 18 months of work. I would go as far as to say we were, in a sense, uplifted by being involved in the success of this Convention, thanks to the open and transparent procedure implemented for the first time. Not all the citizens of Europe may actually have felt engaged. Nonetheless, it is at least the first time a great European venture has been prepared outside a secret diplomatic conference. Nevertheless, it is important simply to note today that a new and different stage is about to begin, namely the Intergovernmental Conference. I trust it is clear that the Commission is tackling this new stage in the same spirit with which it tackled the Convention. We are tackling it with the same will to work with you to achieve our common priorities. If we so wish, we do have the opportunity to improve a limited number of the points of the draft Constitution without upsetting the overall balance. We can clarify all the provisions of this draft, especially the scope of their application. This would prevent certain misunderstandings or confusion when the text is ratified. Lastly, we can ensure that this IGC accomplishes the legal revision work entrusted to it by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sincere belief that, setting aside semantic differences, there is broad agreement between our two institutions on the substance of the matter. The Commission indicated recently in the opinion adopted on 17 September that it is essential this IGC does not call into question the major balances achieved in the draft Constitution as a whole. Allow me to emphasise once again how vital this is. I would also like to reiterate that the College of Commissioners, and in particular the President, Antonio Vitorino and I, are determined to lend our support to the Italian Presidency in achieving this common aim.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to say, on behalf of my group, how extraordinarily grateful we are to the rapporteurs Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos, not only because – as was only to be expected – they have done an outstanding job, but also because their work makes political sense, stating as it does that there are things with which we are not satisfied, areas where one could have gone a good deal further, but that considerations of compromise and balance led us to find a way that we should take.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is an important message, identical to that expressed by the Italian Presidency of the Council, and that it is for this reason that Parliament and the Italian Presidency of the Council will be able to cooperate constructively at the Intergovernmental Conference. It must be clear to us that this draft constitution represents a considerable advance in almost every area. Whereas Nice created only the formal conditions for enlargement, this constitution creates the conditions under which the enlarged community will be viable, with its viability made manifest by its greater capacity for action, improved decision-making mechanisms and the extension of the principle of majority decision-making. We could certainly have done more but, I believe, the progress is plain to see.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clear to us that the removal of the pillar principle and the possibility of development inherent in the actual constitution change the fundamental structure. I believe that the democratic principle has also been decisively strengthened. The Treaty of Amsterdam represented a breakthrough for the right of codecision, which we are now on the way to completing in the course of making the European Parliament an institution with real capacity to act and real powers of codecision in almost all areas of Community law. It must also, moreover, be apparent to us that opening up the Council’s legislative process to the public can make a dramatic leap forward in terms of transparency. I believe it to be crucial that we have a transparent EU, one in which the citizen can establish who is responsible for what, and can upbraid and punish the guilty parties. I believe that, if citizens do not understand how decisions are taken and who is responsible for them, they cannot be expected to accept them. I hope that the influence of national ministries will not be so great in this area as to make transparency in it impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it amounts to a decisive step forward that we should have a division of competences that will make it much easier for us to say, in future, where Europe has authority and where it does not. This too is important in order that the nation states do not feel that they are losing their identity and that Europe is drawing everything to itself. If competences are clearly delineated, then they are an area in respect of which one can demand improved decision-making processes and greater capacity to act, and there will be fewer grey areas. This ties in with the principle of subsidiarity. I see this as really substantial progress, as this gives the national parliaments the opportunity and hence the awareness of exerting influence when they believe that the subsidiarity principle has been violated. I believe that it is also extraordinarily important in terms of the Community’s internal health that the national parliaments have gained for themselves this role, without the levels being confused or decision-making processes made complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that Europe should be brought closer to its citizens, for it will be, in future, by way of the European parliamentary elections that the president of the Commission will be chosen. It is on the citizen that the EU is founded, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights makes him also its subject, protected by it and with the capacity to act. I believe that this, in future, will be of great significance. Within the European Union, we must also ensure that the balance between large and small, rich and poor, new and old members is guaranteed, so that the small countries feel that the balance in the EU’s institutions enables them to put across their point of view and defend their identity. The strength of the larger countries consists in their consideration for the smaller ones. I believe that we have to introduce this into the equation, just as we also have to make it clear that, in structural cooperation in defence and in other areas, when some go on ahead, the door must always be open for others who want to join in at a later date, and that we must put no new obstacles in their way. It must be perfectly clear that this constitution may well be the last chance we have to realise a Europe of equal rights, rather than a two-tier-Europe. In view of Europe’s enlargement, it is important that we try to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final observation. The European Union is also a union of values, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the preamble make clear. If we were to be strong enough to associate the religious element – in a spirit of tolerance – with the word ‘Christian’, that would surely be the sort of progress that would be in the public interest.</p>

I still do not understand, after many years, what criteria are used for allocating speaking time in this Parliament, and I believe that Mr Napolitano, as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, deserved time outside of that allocated to the political groups, but this has not been the case. I would ask you to communicate this to the President of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to express the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the Tsatsos–Gil-Robles report. My colleagues will analyse in detail the aspects which we consider fundamental, with greater authority than my own. What I would like to point out at this stage is that, having heard the Commissioner and being aware of the Commission’s document – which I believe fulfils its responsibility, as guardian of the Treaties, to make proposals, and which is important in terms of institutional balance – I believe there is great correlation between what is said in this report, as an assessment of the aspects which are not properly resolved, and what the Commission says. We will have to look for a way to maintain this balance, which we are all claiming to be so fundamental within the institutional triangle.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a more specific reference to the future reform of the Constitution. Commissioner Barnier has insisted that, symbolically, we must all vote on the same day. With the outstanding issues – which are the subject of an evolutionary clause, the ‘<span class="italic">rendez-vous</span>’ clause – it is true to say that it does make sense to seek solutions which allow us to resolve the problems we have. I hope that the Italian Presidency can do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, and having heard the President—in-Office of the Council, I am going to propose an <span class="italic">in voce</span> amendment to the Tsatsos–Gil-Robles text. With the best of intentions, the President—in-Office of the Council has told us that the Italian Presidency wishes to comply with what it promised in this Parliament, but it has also told us, very diplomatically, that in Riva del Garda it did not achieve that. I believe we must state the facts clearly. What would not be acceptable, having had the Convention, would be to hear the words ‘Time for bed, children, now we are going to discuss serious matters’. That cannot be the case. It is not acceptable from the point of view not just of transparency, but of democratic responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, having also seen what was discussed in Riva del Garda – because the document we have seen does not correspond to what the Italian Presidency is saying here: that we are going to be observers on the same level as such respectable countries as Romania, Bulgaria or Turkey is not a way to give the European Parliament a very worthy position – I would propose that, in paragraph 37, the wording be changed and, rather than saying ‘Strongly welcomes the Italian Presidency's assurance’, it should say ‘Expresses its concern and discontent with the lack of compliance by the Council with the assurances expressed by the Italian Presidency to Parliament’.</p>
<p class="contents">This corresponds to reality at this moment. The Italian Presidency has good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. What we need to do is to ensure that our representation is worthy and corresponds to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by making a proposal to the Italian Presidency, so that it can communicate it to the Council. The majority of foreign affairs ministers were members of the Convention. We are inviting the members of national parliaments who were members of the Convention to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I believe this invitation should be extended to the ministers and the Council, so that these issues may be debated in public, which is what European pubic opinion is demanding.</p>

It is gratifying for those of us who were Members of the Convention to see that, despite some initial posturing, most members of the European Council appear now to be accepting the outcome of the Convention with few qualifications. They can all see that if the IGC discards the outcome of the Convention, then it will fall to them to come up with alternative solutions commanding a greater consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Blair should be especially congratulated for apparently discarding previous British Government positions upon defence. At his Berlin Summit meeting at the weekend, Mr Blair seemed sensibly to accept the Convention's proposals for structured cooperation within and outside Nato, allowing a core group of capable Member States to forge forward to build a common European security and defence policy, not as a last resort but as a first call.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a tribute to the Convention process that it stands up to such critical assessment, especially from this House, which is not known for complacency when it comes to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention certainly examined all the options, refined all the arguments, and took a broad political approach with the common interest of Europe very much at the centre of our work. It is for that reason that this resolution properly demands that the spirit of the Convention – transparent, pluralistic, political – should be brought forward to the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the President's proposals that there should not be technical working groups. I very much support their proposals to have stronger representation of the European Parliament at the IGC. Perhaps it will be possible before the summit on 4 October to reopen this issue at the General Affairs Council next week. An IGC with a more democratic flavour and less diplomatic style will be more successful and much quicker in reaching a conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This work must be protected from slanderers and opponents but it must also be further improved upon – it is not true that there is no scope to do this – and we must reject the theories of those who do not want to change anything, or else all the work that has been achieved will come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I share and support, therefore, the proactive view taken by Mr Prodi, who sees the value of the texts but is also aware of the limits and risks that could arise from it. More specifically, I will indicate corrections that I feel are necessary and possible. I am not referring to the inadequate content and inadequate social rights, which, as we know, are the result of the specific balance of powers today. It is no coincidence, for example, that the Constituent Assembly which wrote the marvellous Italian Constitution in the post-war period, had as its President the communist, Umberto Terracini, while our Convention is chaired by the extremely respectable but extremely moderate Mr Giscard d'Estaing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, referring to issues that are purely institutional. Firstly, a full-time President of the Council who is in office for a long period of time, instead of a rotating presidency, would end up overlapping with the President of the Commission and their work would conflict, causing paralysis and crisis in the institutions. Secondly, unanimity voting must be abolished in all areas because the right to veto can, at any time, block any innovative process. Thirdly, there must be a single common foreign policy and it must be accompanied by a European military capacity superseding NATO which would give us not only an independent role but also a stabilising role in the face of the one-sided, imperialist power that is currently present in and threatening the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree overwhelmingly that the best thing about the Convention was that it was not an Intergovernmental Conference. It was largely parliamentary in character, it was held in public, it engaged in dialogue with the public and civil society, and it had many months in which to do its work. The worst thing about the Convention was that it ended up turning into an Intergovernmental Conference after all. Its conclusion was determined by negotiations and haggling behind the scenes, with nations’ own interests being played off against the European interest, and threats of vetoes being used.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention was successful when it was free. It followed constitutional logic in producing a draft on the future of Europe. Out of it emerged the draft of a European democracy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a republican legal order for Europe, capacity to act and the possibility of a new role in the world. Success eluded the Convention whenever it bowed to governmental pressure and lost itself in a thicket of conflicting interests. Hence we have no European social contract, no European social order, too few decisions taken by majority vote and we still, among other things, have laws made by the Council. The question at issue was not what we could do for Europe, but what we could deny Europe. Many governments are now calling for a ‘real’ Intergovernmental Conference; this is a dangerous threat, and one founded on very dubious legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mathematically speaking, a plus and a minus add up to a minus. Where is the sense in forcing as chronically unsuccessful a method as an Intergovernmental Conference upon one so successful as the Convention? The outcome, the end result, of this simple arithmetic will be that of an IGC, a ‘Nice Mark II’ – not the highest common denominator, but the lowest, and were the governments not represented at the Convention, and at the highest level? Did they not brutally force through their positions? Were you not at the Convention, Commissioner Barnier? Did you not agree to a great compromise? Can the Commission really take on the historic responsibility of enabling the governments to unilaterally change this historic consensus for the sake of their own interests? In doing so, are you not enabling the forces of destruction to absolve themselves? Commissioner, your place is alongside the European Parliament as it fights for this compromise. You will have to answer for that; it is perhaps the gravest error in the whole of its period in office for which the Commission will have to account.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Intergovernmental Conference do without demolishing this consensus, without – behind closed doors – perpetuating the same old horse-trading that we saw at Nice? It should accept the Convention’s draft, it should deal, in the spirit of the majority in the Convention, with those issues that the governments blocked, those on which there is no consensus, especially the revision clause. That was something on which the Convention could come to no agreement; the Intergovernmental Conference should make it possible for future amendments to the Constitution to be made by a democratic majority. It should, moreover, resolve the inconsistencies between parts 1 and 3, which are largely the result of governmental intervention. If we promise the people the social market economy in part 1, but the free, untrammelled competitive society in part 3, then we are not being honest with the public. If we promise full employment in part 1, but only a high level of employment in part 3, that amounts to a trick, and it will not build confidence in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If, at this historic moment, we make the wrong choice, we will be leading Europe into a crisis. If, after wrecking the methodology of the Intergovernmental Conference, we go on to wreck and discredit the methodology of the Convention, we will be left with nothing. What will we then be able to do when the crisis strikes? Hard though this compromise may have been for all of us, we should defend the Convention on the future of Europe.</p>

Let us heed Robert Schuman carefully, though! His exact words are these: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a <span class="italic">de facto</span> solidarity.’ I repeat: it will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a <span class="italic">de facto</span> solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let us see what we have on the table. We have a Convention, to produce which, Mr Giscard d’Estaing told us here, 1 800 speeches were made and thousands of amendments proposed. There was not one vote, however. Not a single vote. This process was not democratic either in principle or in practice, and it far exceeded its mandate. What would it mean, then, if the Convention’s conclusions were imposed as final, as the rapporteurs would like, riding roughshod over the powers and responsibilities democratically granted only to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)? It would mean a blow against Robert Schuman.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us cast our eye once again over the Convention’s text, which, say its supporters, should be forcibly enshrined as the Constitution. What do we see there? We see an attempt to make Europe ‘all at once’, upsetting a long-established balance by means of a new ‘single plan’. Another blow against Schuman. Let us remember, moreover, what happened some weeks ago at the IGC planning meeting in Riva del Garda. Various Member States, various countries expressed major reservations about the Convention text. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has incorporated those reservations into the amendments it has tabled to this report, on the composition of the Commission, the Presidency, the role of Christianity, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">These criticisms received a blunt response from Mr Oskar Fischer in the form of the financial forecasts for 2007-13. The press correctly interpreted the German minister’s threat as ill-judged budgetary blackmail. What does this amount to? It amounts to a negation of the ‘concrete achievements’ which gradually ‘create a de facto solidarity’. That was precisely what Schuman was advocating on 9 May 1950.</p>
<p class="contents">The united voices of my group, therefore, urge the IGC to look to Schuman’s method for its true inspiration, never forgetting 9 May. I would appeal to the Italian Presidency, therefore, not to kowtow to threatening language, to restraints, to blackmail by Member States, and rather to encourage free, equal and open debates. Our responsibility is to prevent the haste and pressure of a few from destroying, against the grain of democracy, the magnificent edifice whose foundations were laid by the Treaty of Rome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twelve meeting days have been set aside this autumn for negotiating a constitution that extremely few people have yet heard of. It is to be adopted on 13 December and signed on 9 May, whereupon we can go to the polls and participate in referendums, but not change the Constitution. That is not fair, and it is not at all democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">The peoples of Europe have not yet asked for a Constitution. None of them have been properly involved in the EU elite’s plans to transfer electoral power to Brussels. In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we agreed, with 22 votes in favour and 3 against, to call upon all the countries, where possible, to hold referendums. The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities supports that decision wholeheartedly. Take that decision now, for it is only when people know that they are to vote on the plans that they begin to take an interest. When matters become serious, people get involved in them. If all the EU countries make up their minds to hold referendums at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament in June, we shall have the opportunity to hold the first common European debate. It will then become apparent whether we can also reach a common conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and believe that the voters will reject the draft prepared under President Giscard d'Estaing’s fairly authoritarian leadership, referred to as consensus. I collected 200 signatures with a view to reversing the procedure so that it might begin with openness. My petition was signed by all the elected representatives from the national parliaments and supported by all the Members of the European Parliament apart from Mr Duhamel. What was requested does not, however, form part of the final report. I collected 123 signatures with a view to ensuring that all the countries should continue to have Commissioners. No such arrangement is, however, part of the consensus. We have instead obtained a division into Commissioners with and without voting rights – a proposal that was not submitted to, or discussed in, the Convention until the very end. The main thrust of the draft Constitution is to transfer much more power from our parliamentary democracies to the Brussels of the officials and lobbyists.</p>
<p class="contents">It will soon be impossible for our countries’ electorates to change many decisions that can at present be overturned by voters in elections. Our democracies are being vigorously pruned back, and the national parliaments are surrendering power to a degree not matched by the additional influence acquired by the European Parliament. If democracy is to be cut back, the decision to do so should at least be taken democratically by the voters themselves in referendums. Let us therefore call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to urge all the countries to hold referendums. Why not, moreover, prepare two different proposals, namely a democratic federal constitution and a draft treaty for a Europe of the democracies. In that way, we can safely let the European voters take the decision about our common future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this image is enough to avoid long debates and, above all, to say what this Constitution lacks.</p>
<p class="contents">This Constitution is, without a doubt, the result of laborious institutional <span class="italic">bricolage</span>, difficult to explain and even more difficult to understand and, as a result, little liked. It is a complicated work, complex and, I fear, ineffectual. There are indisputable improvements as regards the internal sectors relating to the citizens of Europe or to our lives – those sectors that have been defined as collateral – but the issue that this Constitution does not address or resolve is defining the role, the responsibility, the resources and the procedures necessary to make Europe not only what it is already – a great economic power – but also what it should be, namely a responsible political player on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not even attempt to respond to this. The Constitution conveys the image of an introverted Europe, of an inward-looking Europe, which is, of course, concerned about the well-being of its own citizens but is not giving itself structures, procedures, commitments or anything at all to help it discharge its responsibilities – which it does have – beyond its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not even giving ourselves the instruments to respond to this need for Europe, this appeal to Europe, this demand for Europe – that is so strong in so many parts of the world, from the near east to the southern shores of the Mediterranean – to this need for European values, to be a partner in essentially fairer development which is based more on human, civil and political rights. We condemn ourselves with this Constitution to always and in all cases being towed along by others – grumbling, of course. It is all too easy, but, above all, I think it goes against the spirit and goals of Europe and, in particular, our duties as Europeans towards peoples that, even although not European, are our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as a longstanding and ever more convinced federalist, for the sake of political realism, for love of the Europe that should be able to draw strength from its own successes to promote other successes, at least in neighbouring countries, I believe that this Constitution is a lost opportunity; an opportunity lost that others will suffer for. It may be that we Europeans will improve our standard of living, but others will suffer for our small-minded actions, our great mediocrity, precisely because we have decided to remain merely a great economic power. That is not enough. This is not what being European means, at least not for me!</p>

<p class="contents">Our opinion sets out a few points from our area of activity on which we would like clarification. The first is that, in line with its institutional status, the Court of Auditors should be included among the institutions listed in the draft constitution, and its functions should be set out more clearly later on in it. Secondly, the giving of discharge – including to the agencies – should be referred to under the Budgetary and Financial Principles, in order to make it clearer that it is Parliament that exercises democratic control. Thirdly, as regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we recommend, on the basis of the original motion put to the Convention by Parliament’s delegation, that the establishment of this public prosecutor’s office be put in clear terms rather than being left as an optional provision, and that the present unanimity principle in the Council be replaced by the legislative procedure, in other words, by qualified majority voting. We believe that these recommendations would help bring about a Europe of freedom, security and justice in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="contents">The draft that we are examining today represents a great step forwards, in particular, in the field of constructing a single European area of freedom, security and justice. It is a step forwards because the Community method is, for the most part, used in this area, a method which should be the only decision-making method in a federal Europe since it respects the values of democracy and the rule of law, both founded on the principle that laws must be approved by representatives of the people, and, consequently, that European laws must be approved by the European Parliament. Furthermore, it respects the criterion that decisions must be taken by qualified majority voting, which enhances unity, whilst unanimity breeds particularism and divisions: where this method is adopted Europe moves towards the future; where the exclusive power of governments remains, Europe returns to its past, its tragic past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly to be regretted that the simplification of procedures even diminishes the status of joint consultation, as the cooperation procedures have been made merely consultative.

<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, though, that we would have liked to see the appointment of a Minister for Economic Affairs, which would, in particular, have enabled us – especially in the euro zone – to make a qualitative leap in terms of how we implement the Lisbon objectives. I also think it regrettable that we have not been able to get the Lisbon process constitutionalised, which means that this new Constitutional Treaty cannot be described as a real European economic constitution.

<p class="contents">In many ways the European Union already exercises maximum powers in the area covered by my committee: we have codecision and qualified majority voting. However, there are certain lessons we can draw from our experience. The main lesson that I would draw – which is not embodied in the Convention text – is that we need to be much more careful that we adopt legislation that is put into force. Therefore we need to build into the Constitution or Constitutional Treaty an absolute requirement for the three institutions – the European Commission, the Council of Ministers <span class="italic">and</span> the European Parliament – to provide cost-benefit impact assessments of the amendments which they propose for legislation. Unless we do that, we shall continue to adopt legislation which all countries agree with, but which in some countries is ignored and which a lot of countries cannot afford. This will become much more important with the enlargement of the European Union to include a lot of very poor countries. As it is, if we go on with the expectations that we are arousing but cannot fulfil, we will not do Europe or Europe's consumers any good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common fisheries policy has been an abject failure: the core objectives of the CFP were to save jobs and conserve fish stocks, but thousands of jobs have been destroyed and fish stocks have collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of conservation, our fishermen have been forced to dump two million tonnes of prime dead fish back into the sea every year to comply with the quota scheme. In the name of conservation, our fishermen have suffered tie-ups, lay-offs, emergency closures, decommissioning and plunging incomes. We are struggling now to reform the CFP and to stop the final collapse of the industry in the North Sea and other key sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of paramount importance that fisheries policy is highlighted. The committee was alarmed that the Convention seemed to attach fisheries policy to agriculture as a mere appendage. For the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the sector throughout the EU, we are not an appendage to agriculture: we are a major sector. Please ensure that our bid for codecision-making powers in the Committee on Fisheries is endorsed. Please also ensure that we can start playing a meaningful role in the future of the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has for years been the view of the majority on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and I might add that I do not share it. The reason for this request is the following: for a considerable number of regions in the European Union, the tourism industry forms an important, if not <span class="italic">the</span> most important, source of income, just as agriculture or industry do in other regions. Many businesses in the tourism industry are small and medium-sized enterprises and would already benefit from regulations for this category. Nevertheless, it is expected that a Community tourism policy would provide extra support for the industry’s sustainable development. Prosperity in the relevant regions would increase, thereby benefiting economic and social cohesion. As such, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would request that a legal basis for European tourism policy be included in the new Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether or not the deputies were counted alongside the members proper, the same result was produced. What is more, the average age in the Praesidium was 53, the members concerned being men. There was only one woman, who might almost be regarded as a female hostage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reservations remained intact when we saw the first draft. There was absolutely no mention of equality, ‘mainstreaming’ or anything at all along those lines. Fortunately, things went well in the end. Equality was made one of the fundamental values, and I should like to take the opportunity also to thank all those who have contributed to the Convention’s success. There is still a lot to be done, and I wish to emphasise that, if the constitutional Treaty is implemented, there are still areas of relevance in terms of equality where matters are not perfect. That is something of which I should like to ask everyone – the Commission, the Council and the representatives of the European Parliament – to be aware. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in ten days' time yet another Intergovernmental Conference will get under way. The European Union seems to be in a state of permanent IGC. Over the last 16 years we have had the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and, more recently, the Nice Treaty. In each case there has been an inevitable process of one-way integration, a sense that the European Union can only be successful if it acquires more and more power. And yet the peoples of Europe meanwhile have been increasingly registering their disillusionment with the European political process, through record low turnouts in European elections. There is a dilemma here for us and cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">This IGC is leading to something quite different from past treaties. It will seek for the first time to create a constitution for the European Union. The draft constitutional Treaty increases the centralising and integrating agenda which has been the hallmark of European development in recent years. We should be going back to first principles.</p>
<p class="contents">At Laeken, the Heads of State and Government called for better and clearer definitions of the EU's competences, simplification of legal instruments, greater democracy, greater transparency and efficiency and for European institutions to be brought closer to the citizens. It is all a far cry from what the Convention has proposed; and now we are being asked to ensure that the IGC does not undermine the Convention in any way. It is back to that same old message: Europe must deepen its integration or risk going backwards. It is time for a reality check and perhaps Sweden warned us of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is in real danger of moving way ahead of what the people of Europe want. For those like me and my party, who believe in membership of the European Union and in a Europe of nation states cooperating closely together, this rush to integration that is represented in the Convention paper risks a backlash from the electorate. I fear that Europe could be facing a crisis of legitimacy. First we were told by the British Government that there was no need for a constitution. Now in Britain we are told such a constitution is essential. Next we are told that the IGC was a mere tidying-up exercise. Then Mr Blair in the UK started signalling furiously that there were redline issues for him in the IGC – on tax, on defence and social security. But according to reports published over the weekend he has sold out on these as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My party has a simple and democratic answer to the twisting and tortured approach of the Prime Minister and his government to the IGC, and that is to give the British people a referendum. Let them decide whether this further leap forward towards a federal Europe is in fact what they want. If a referendum is good enough for the peoples of Ireland, Spain and other nations, then I believe it is good enough for the people of the United Kingdom and polls indicate that 80% of people in the UK want it.</p>
<p class="contents">The IGC will debate a fundamental shift in the power balance between nation states and the institutions of the European Union. I fear that railroading through a constitutional change of such magnitude at such a late stage in the enlargement process could lead to further disaffection and disillusionment amongst the people of the accession states and of the current 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we in this Parliament have a duty to represent the interests of our electors. By supporting the motion for a resolution in its unamended form we send a signal that the political élite knows what is best for our electors. That is a dangerous message in election year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can do this thanks to the careful and impartial analysis provided by the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos: an analysis advocating turning to account of all the innovations, progress and potential offered by the Convention’s draft. It is therefore clear why Parliament is urging the Intergovernmental Conference straight out to do justice to the Convention’s result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that we are particularly sensitive to the importance and the emotion of this historic process: the birth of a European Constitution, which was the dream of Altiero Spinelli. The draft supported by him and adopted by this Parliament almost 20 years ago laid the foundations with vision.</p>
<p class="contents">This must not, however, prevent us from assessing the text issued by the Convention objectively, to take note of its shortcomings, contradictions and uncertainties. Indeed Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Degado and Mr Tsatsos did not fail to mention them in their report, they did not shirk their responsibility to point them out with the necessary critical spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the basic problem is not that Parliament is dissatisfied that certain positions and proposals have not been accepted, but the danger that the EU will not be capable of addressing the challenges awaiting it properly. It is with this in mind that we urge the Intergovernmental Conference to reflect, to look at every possible way of increasing the coherence of the draft Constitution and to prevent any distortion of it, so as to avoid any steps backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, through its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, will follow the Intergovernmental Conference with the utmost attention and vigilance. The approach that we have chosen to adopt is highly constructive, not uncritical and very responsible, and I believe that there must be no contrast between our attitude and that taken by the Commission, although that is not to deny the distinction between the two institutions or their independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency can count on their united efforts to stand up to the pressure from those governments that want to reopen negotiations because, Mr Antonione, there have already been negotiations in the Convention and to reopen them on the fundamental issues would make the Conference unmanageable. I hope that the Italian Presidency will show itself to be consistent and firm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some who criticise the Convention, but I think that most of us in the House today can see that the Convention method has worked. It is a success, and it has come to stay. There is, in actual fact, talk of a democratic step forward, and that is something we should emphasise. It is not perfect, but it is a democratic advance in relation to all the previous Intergovernmental Conferences. Moreover, the fact that we have had this broad debate is a sound foundation for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who thought that the people should have been more fully involved. That is possibly the case, but people cannot perhaps be expected to run around discussing constitutional treaties in the middle of their everyday lives. That is of course, in a way, what they have elected ourselves, as MEPs, to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, devised, in this House, a number of basic conditions that would enable people to be involved more fully. I shall mention a couple of these conditions. First of all, simplification would in itself make it easier for people to take an interest and to understand the Treaty and European development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have now brought about a situation which the basis of values on which we operate in Europe has been defined in detail. This is a very good thing, bringing the EU closer to the people and increasing their understanding. The fact that we have arranged for the practical political objectives of our cooperation to be specified is also of great value to people. I think, too, that we in Parliament can safely say that there are no other regions in the world that have those values and objectives underpinning their political cooperation. It is quite simply splendid.</p>
<p class="contents">The third good thing is that the national parliaments are now being given greater responsibility than they had previously, and the fourth is, of course, that those of us in Parliament are now obliged, in very practical terms, to follow up matters in all our work, irrespective of the subject. I can quote, as an example, Mr Cashman’s report, which we shall be debating later.</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, I wish to refer to one matter that was not mentioned. We found no solution to the problem of our two homes. We did not resolve the basic issue, namely that the European Parliament itself must decide where it will hold its sessions. That, moreover, is an issue that I should very much like to call upon the Italian Presidency to address. I know it is difficult, but we shall never obtain proper acceptance of European work if the Members of the European Parliament chase around as they do at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the Convention, I supported the outcome of the proceedings with its overall content in mind, although, like others, I was unable to assent to all the statements made.</p>
<p class="contents">What will come out of all this is, for the first time in the history of European integration, a European constitution establishing a framework within which many millions of people in over twenty-five states can live together; that is what is really significant. I see it as a positive thing that the EU as a whole will become more democratic, that progress has been made in the separation of the powers, that Parliament will be given more rights and that referendums will be introduced. It is also very important to me that the EU can become more social, although this presupposes that we stick to the goals and values set out in Part I. What that means is that, if we are to have the social mission, as incorporated in the Convention’s draft, the Intergovernmental Conference must resist the European Central Bank’s insistence that this provision be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all else, the Intergovernmental Conference must complete the work that the Convention ended up being unable to do. That is a matter of political and legal obligation. How are the public to understand a constitutional document that presents them – and I know I am exaggerating – with two different economic philosophies: on the one hand, the social market economy, balanced economic growth and full employment; on the other hand, an open market economy with free competition and merely a high level of employment? I might add that the same applies to other aspects. This makes it important that Amendment No 3 be adopted today and that this House should give the Intergovernmental Conference a clear mandate to do away with the inconsistencies between Part III and Part I.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say in unmistakeable terms that I reject all those provisions intended to develop the European Union as a military and interventionist power. That is not Europe’s way of emancipating itself from American hegemony; it will be by way of civil conflict resolution and civil conflict prevention that the European Union will become a respected partner on the international stage. Nor is it acceptable for the Constitution to oblige the Member States to enhance their military capacities at the same time as there is no more money available for social security expenditure, pensions or education, and while new indebtedness is reaching dizzying levels.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should also be guided by the ideals and the spirit of the Convention. It is because the public have a right to see how the second stage of the constitutional process proceeds that the governments should hold their sessions in public and in a transparent manner.</p>

As is stated in the Tsatsos report, it is a major step in the Union’s democratisation process, but we are still not developing into the decisive and transparent Europe that can play a role on the world stage and inspire confidence in its own citizens. Sovereignty only rests with a few Member States that boast their own constitutional structure. The diversity of languages and cultures is only recognised within the Member States that grant this recognition. The regions that have constitutional authority are witnessing the accession to the EU of some ten new Member States, some of which are smaller than those of their own regions that possess constitutional powers, such as Flanders, Scotland, Catalonia, Wales, and so on. These sovereign states may even be less willing to work towards the establishment of a real Union. This will become clear shortly in the IGC. However, the small states are also our allies. I would like to urge them to help defend the result that has been achieved in this convention. At least a certain balance has been achieved in these texts. There is a certain unity in diversity, but we should, above all, continue to uphold these latter aspects together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft Treaty presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki forms the basis for discussions on a final agreed text at European Union level. The vast majority of people agree that the European Union must change the procedures it uses if it is to become a more effective political body in a Community of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions that will take place on 4 October will be the next phase of these important negotiations. The model for decision-making within the Union dates back, in part, to when the European Economic Community was a six-Member organisation in the late 1950s. This is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in the principle of equality between small and large Member States. In particular I believe that representation within the European Commission should be based on a system of strict equality between small and large states. I support the continuation of each Member State of the Union having the right to appoint a nominee as a full voting member of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also that the precise role of the European Union President / President of the European Council is clearly specified in the new Treaty. Equally I welcome the fact that the new Treaty will define the powers between the European Commission itself and the individual Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some reservations in the context of the negotiations in the IGC. The issue of taxation must remain the preserve and remit of the individual Member States' governments. I do not believe that support from the citizens of the Union for the EU extends to the area of deciding taxation levels in Europe. Ever since the European Convention was set up, however, extensive negotiations and discussions have taken place across all elements of European Union society. Over the coming months we must approach these negotiations with firm determination so that an agreement can be secured on a text for the final Treaty, which hopefully would govern the operation of the Union for the next 50 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will not, I fear, succeed in stopping the process that seeks to cancel out national and regional potential but, rather, it will advance the construction of a European superstate governed by a stateless technocracy which will go wherever globalisation takes it.</p>
<p class="contents">A European Constitution, especially today with the serious challenge represented by China – which, in addition to its products, has succeeded in imitating even the logo of the European Union – should, instead, provide for the reintroduction of customs duties and limits to protect our production, in particular to protect the system of small and medium sized enterprises and our agrifood production. It should, first and foremost, enshrine the value of the protection and development of our cultural identities to preserve an ethno-cultural, historical and linguistically unique heritage in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">For us citizens of Padania, it is unacceptable that a European Constitution should, instead of drawing its inspiration from the historical root of Charlemagne, appear to take the euro–dollar relationship as its only spiritual guiding principle. It should, instead, lay claim to its own Christian roots with pride, in particular in the face of the grave danger of creeping Islamicisation. Furthermore, it is unacceptable that there should be no specific reference to the rights of peoples, even though those rights have been confirmed in various UN resolutions, or, in particular, to the principle of self-determination of peoples – inalienable for us citizens of Padania – and that has called forth legitimate protests from representatives of non-Italian ethnic groups in the Italian State, including the Sardinians and the people of the Valle d’Aosta and South Tyrol.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty years on from the Declaration of Chivasso, the historic document marking the birth of federalism drawn up 19 December 1943 – particularly difficult times for Europe and for our country – by representatives from the Valle d’Aosta, the Waldensians and the people of Provençe to protect the regional cultures against centralism from Rome, we cannot endorse a Constitution that ignores the rights of peoples and regions if we want to respect the ideals of these fathers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be an extremely serious political error to allow the IGC to fail and not to give Europe its first Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am an optimist and I am personally convinced that no one will want to be responsible for undoing the work of the Convention and for wiping out the hope of having a Europe that is politically strong and independent at last, a Europe that can play the part of the power required to balance an international situation dominated today by the United States, with the prospect of an increase in China’s power in the future. Let us be clear: we believe in a more influential Europe which is independent from the United States but, at the same time, a friend and ally of a country and a people that have also made a decisive contribution to ensuring freedom and democracy in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the opinion of the Italian Presidency and those who believe that the structure adopted by the Convention cannot be radically changed. Perfection is the enemy of good: pursuing unfeasible projects would mean not achieving the goal towards which we are all striving. It would be very serious, as you have said here, Mr Antonione, to accept substantial compromises and I welcome this opportunity – as a Member of the European Parliament – to thank the Italian Presidency for its endeavours to ensure that this House is represented in the Intergovernmental Conference. I therefore endorse the line taken in the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgrado and Mr Tsatsos regarding the need for the European Parliament to play an important role, and I hope that other countries will follow the advice of the Italian Presidency and rally round to support the commitment taken in this House by President Berlusconi.</p>
<p class="contents">Some corrections will, of course, have to be made to the text adopted by the Convention, such as, for example, an increase in the number of areas where decisions can be made by qualified majority voting and the need to reach agreement on the number and role of Commissioners. Then, it would be a serious historical error, Mr President, to exclude any reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian roots. I am not saying that we should renounce the secular nature of the institutions; on the contrary, we would be reinforcing this inalienable characteristic, remembering the command given in the gospels to ‘give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God’s’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is appropriate here to recall the words of many laymen – I am thinking here of the philosopher, Norberto Bobbio, the philosopher, Benedetto Croce – who insisted on the role and the importance of religions in the history and growth of Europe. How can we fail to mention a great painter such as Marc Chagall, a European painter, Jewish, who also devoted himself to depicting the spirituality of Europeans, and who confirmed that painters have dipped their brushes into that colourful alphabet of hope that are the Sacred Scriptures. Turning now to those who are forming ranks to oppose this choice, I would also like to recall the words of Chancellor Schroeder, who stated in the <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> that he was not against inserting the reference to Judaeo-Christian roots into the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe that wants to explore new horizons, called upon to bring together new citizens of different religions, really cannot afford to erase its own roots. Mr President, we cannot explore new horizons if we do not know where we came from.</p>

<p class="contents">The great challenge facing us now is to get the Constitution through the IGC without it being dismantled bit by bit. That is why we welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution which we will adopt is not calling for significant changes to the draft Constitution. Of course it rightly expresses some criticisms: it highlights shortcomings in the Constitution. However, this is done to show that we too have compromised to achieve this result. The package that has been agreed in the Constitution is, nonetheless, one that takes the European Union forward in a number of ways as regards democracy, efficiency, transparency and understandability of the Union. It therefore deserves to be adopted by the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">There are dangers lurking. There are governments – Spain, for instance – which object to the system of double majority in the Council and want to revert to the Nice system, which is complex, not understandable and not a very sensible system. Why should we accept a retrograde move to allow one or more governments to preserve what is, frankly, an unfair system? There are governments that want to reopen the question of the composition of the Commission. I, too, have some doubts about the formula of the Commission. However, I recognise that it is part of a wider compromise that was achieved in the IGC. The key question is: what is the remedy for this? If we move to one Commissioner per Member State and one vote per Commissioner, would we not be turning the Commission into a sort of Coreper, an intergovernmental body? That is not what the role of the Commission should be.</p>
<p class="contents">I also oppose those who wish to make a reference to religion in the Constitution. We are a Union of diverse religions, of religious pluralism. There are people in our Union who are not religious. We should not impose a particular view on religion in the Constitution. That would be a form of cultural imperialism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the issue of a referendum. It is not up to the European Union to tell its Member States what procedure they should use internally to ratify a treaty setting up a constitution. That is a matter for each Member State in accordance with its Constitution and its traditions. Therefore I oppose the position taken by Mr Evans and others that this Parliament should tell Member States what procedure they should use to ratify and we will be seeking to amend that paragraph accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The weakest link in the proposed new Treaty is the proposals concerning the Council. Although many objected beforehand to the establishment of new institutions, the Convention is actually proposing that two new institutions should be created. The European Council is to be considered as a separate institution, and it is being proposed that it should have an external President. Both proposals are the wrong ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must be considered in the new Treaty as a single institution, and a prime minister or president who is in office must be elected as its long-term President. The Presidencies of Councils of Ministers for the various areas of policy must be shared among the representatives of more than one country. The Presidencies must be for two and a half years, and the Member States must be treated impartially when assigning them.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a reform of the Council would correspond to the proposals that Secretary General of the European Council, Javier Solana, made over a year ago. They must be given consideration in the Intergovernmental Conference, as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes in Amendment No 28. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As they themselves said, there are negative points and there are obstacles which we shall find in our path towards unification and which we shall have to overcome in order to cast an informed vote.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these is the reform process. It is impossible for half the Treaty, 150 articles in part three, to have a non-revisable status, because that is where we shall end up with the provisions which we are planning; in other words, policies will be regime. That is impossible. It goes against every political development of Europe in every direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot proceed with the budget as it is being configured today. We are making a clownish trick here of what we teach our first-year economics students. How can we have a budget which says, ‘here is your money, now decide what policies you are going to introduce’, instead of saying what policies we want and then seeing what budget will serve them?</p>
<p class="contents">Third point: the Convention itself did not accept nor, I imagine, will the Intergovernmental Conference proceed with the concept of the Ministers for Finance. Where is the cohesion of the eurozone, the symmetry between economic and monetary policy, to come from? Where will the real hard core of the European Union come from, if not from here? I think that it is a huge mistake and we shall find that too in our path. The same applies to the timidity on issues of security and defence. My honourable friend Mr Cossutta said as much, I shall not repeat him.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment on one last issue, the reference to religions. I fail to understand which religions they wish to cite as being of value. Or why we need to refer to what is indeed the important history of Christianity but not, for example, to the history of free thinking? Or even of anti-clericalism, which inspired the Enlightenment, which inspired revolutions and intellectuals and policies in Europe. Or why we should not refer to the big names? For me, the face of Europe is Aristotle, it is Erasmus, it is Mozart, it is Marx, it is Freud. Are we going to impose them on our citizens? Let us allow our citizens a pluralistic choice for their future lives and careers. Perhaps this pluralism will be the real face of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The equivalent in our draft Constitution is 473, that is Section 4, Article 7, paragraph 3. This is the revision clause. It could be termed the ‘in perpetuity clause’ as henceforth double unanimity will be needed to dot any I or cross any T. I refer to unanimity at the IGC and at the level of ratification. One might as well say that this is impossibility set in stone. I would also like to highlight that no consensus has been reached on this article, as it was not debated in depth in plenary at the Convention, given the time pressure of the last few days.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to whether this Convention text is a treaty or a constitution. The terms of a treaty can be amended if there is the unanimous agreement of the contracting parties. The terms of a constitution can be amended by a qualified or overqualified majority. Constitutions are never amended by unanimity, however.</p>
<p class="contents">If the aim is to create a constitution, an adjustment is certainly called for. A new clause will be needed to facilitate progress. This could be some kind of enabling clause, for example. The draft Constitution already has many such clauses. The report itself is extremely weak on this point. Even so, our rapporteurs themselves state there is a danger of collapse if no changes are made. We have no right over the future of others. Article 4.7.3 must therefore be amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also indebted to the Italian Presidency for its constructive approach, and Commissioner Barnier, who, together with Commissioner Vitorino, played such a key role in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the work that I have done on behalf of our Parliament in the Convention is the single most important piece of work that I have done in my career in the European Parliament that has spanned twenty years. To work on a constitution for twenty-five, and soon perhaps thirty, European Member States, is to work on an important part of our common history. When we consider Europe’s violent past, we realise all the more that it is a very big step in the right direction, one that should bring peace and development to present and future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this now mean that the work that has been done is complete? No, but perfection is not in any case within the grasp of human beings. We can, however, establish that the Convention has achieved more than the amendments to the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice together. This is why the model of the Convention should be preserved also in future. We now know that a Convention achieves a great deal more than the normal IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">I will quote five positive elements: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has been incorporated in the constitution, which also includes a sound anti-discrimination clause. The Union’s constitutional standards and values as a community of law have been laid down effectively. In the relationship between the Council, Commission and Parliament, transparency and democratic procedures have now taken centre stage, and Parliament has been granted sound powers in terms of codecision legislation whereby decision-making by majority has become the rule. The whole legislative system and process have become a lot simpler and more transparent, with more openness in the Council, as a result of which the Council has now, in my opinion, taken on the character of a Senate. The concept of subsidiarity is expressed far more effectively through the national and also regional parliaments being given their own roles to play in the European decision-making processes, so that the Union’s activities can be carried out a great deal closer to the European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the result is good, but it is not perfect. The shortcomings I should like to mention are the lack of a qualified majority in the decision-making process on foreign policy, trade agreements and financial perspectives. Furthermore, I take the view that every Member State should retain its own Commissioner. These shortcomings, however, are not so serious that we cannot be positive about the document. I sincerely hope that the Heads of Government will reach agreement about this Constitution before Christmas, so that we can equip ourselves with this document for the European elections, and can add the positive judgments of the European citizens to it.</p>

<p class="contents">The Convention was a success. In a transparent fashion, it enshrined a broad consensus in the draft Constitution, a solid balance which involves this Parliament, the Commission and the national parliaments and governments, which undoubtedly moves the European Union forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We are undergoing a Constitution-building process, of which the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) must be one stage, and it must not dilute or reduce the fundamental content of the main progress made in the draft Constitution. These include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of a binding nature, the legislative procedure as a general rule, the extension of the qualified majority, the creation of institutional figures – such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs – who are clearly useful, the progress on justice and home affairs and, of course, the Convention as an essential method for future constitutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked more progress: for example, greater extension of the qualified majority, for there to be no exceptions to the legislative procedure, a strengthening of economic and social government, or more flexible constitutional ratification or revision procedures, but we can achieve all of this through future constitutional development, on the basis of a co-relationship between clearly Europeanist forces.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the IGC to be a success, furthermore, it must properly resolve the problems which are still on the table. One example of this is achieving an institutional balance within which each country is suitably represented. All the governments must contribute to achieving this, doing so with the same agreement-seeking spirit which existed in the Convention, strengthening the consensus in it and in the whole of the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and we, in the European Parliament, must send a positive message to the citizens so that they support this Constitution and, if possible, do so by means of a referendum. There is no doubt that the text of this report sends this message; we therefore congratulate and support the rapporteurs and their text.</p>

However, we Catalan Members from <span class="italic">Convergencia i Unió</span> will abstain.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is that an aspect which is fundamental to us, and I believe also to many European citizens, has not been considered as fully as we had asked for. The peoples of Europe who are identifiable as stateless nations, or in regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, have not been associated in the manner we called for.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the draft Constitution takes up certain principles which we believe to be valid, but it does not include the guarantees we called for in order to associate the regions with full legislative powers with the European institutions, nor does it guarantee that they have access to the Court of Justice, nor does it ensure the inclusion in its linguistic system of languages which are official in the Member States. That means that a language such as Catalan – which will be the eighth most widely-spoken in the enlarged Union – lacks and will lack the Union’s official recognition and there will be no guarantee that it will have it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that we recognise the positive elements of this Constitution and the inclusion of the principles relating to cultural and linguistic diversity and the principle of subsidiarity for the regions, which we believe to be very important, and a modest degree of progress in terms of the competences of the Committee of the Regions. However, for the reasons I have given, we shall reserve our definitive vote for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how to discover the will of states. It is represented by governments and national parliaments. The will of the people is not always the same as the will of states, and, to learn what it is, there is no alternative but to have a referendum. The fairest course of action would be to arrange one in each Member State separately but on the same day.</p>
<p class="contents">If the subject of a referendum were the Convention’s draft Constitution without any amendments to it, I would vote against it and I would urge others to vote the same way. The reason is that the Convention worked undemocratically. It had a Praesidium, a Politburo-style dictatorship, and the Convention did not vote on the more than 6 000 proposed amendments made by its members or the final outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention brought about a redistribution of power that favoured the big countries and the Union was militarised. The Member States lose their right to a permanent Commissioner with voting rights, and in future will not be able to choose their own Commissioner. All candidate Commissioners must be committed to the Europe issue, but what is this Europe issue? It is the issue of federalism. The EU is to be made into a federation, and on the last night the Convention, acting against the mandate for a Constitution presented at the Thessaloniki Summit, even adopted the symbols of a federation, with its own flag, anthem and national day.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Constitution the EU will become militarised. That means a new type of military structural cooperation and a declaration under the Constitution that Member States will give each other collective defence guarantees. A commander in the Finnish army said that acceptance of this declaration would take Finland into NATO, and that is something our nation will not agree to. These are the reasons for saying no to such a constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I deplore the weakness of the political message delivered by Parliament’s report. Clearly, the draft Constitutional Treaty represents an improvement over the Treaty of Nice. It is, however, appropriate to highlight its serious deficiencies. If the IGC does not rectify these, they will pose a considerable handicap to the government and future development of a European Union of 27 Member States. Maintaining unanimity for decision-making on crucial issues and the procedure for the future revision of treaties are particularly problematic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the IGC, and in view of the positions adopted by governments wishing to renegotiate certain articles of the treaty, the European Commission showed political wisdom. In its remarkable opinion, the Commission underlined the weaknesses of the text and the need to improve it. The Commission is sending out the right political signal whereas Parliament is sending out the wrong one. This is why I will vote against the European Parliament report.

We are all aware and appreciative of the high quality and lofty ambitions of those responses. They are not desultory, but form one body, whose feet are firmly planted on the ground and which is prepared, with great pragmatism, to imagine a responsible and challenging future for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The thinking behind the draft on the table is not short-termist or experimental. As a Constitution, this text aspires to permanence. As the work of human hands, however, it is not perfect or polished. It can and should be fine-tuned, as long as its basic equilibrium is maintained. The Gil-Robles – Tsatsos report is very clear in that regard. The Intergovernmental Conference can and should make the text of the Constitution more coherent, and improve some of its proposals. In this connection, I would like to support what the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, and the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, have already said about the problems of the two-tier regime for the composition and functioning of the Commission, which, to my mind, is undesirable because it is inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier spoke to us a moment ago of nostalgia, warning us that it is not a good guide in politics. I can think of no better advice to give the Heads of Government charged with approving the Constitution at the next Intergovernmental Conference, for the process they are currently overseeing is not like previous revisions of the Treaties. The Convention was not simply a preparatory phase, as its predecessors were. It led to very important political balances and consensuses being achieved, and they should remain intact. The Heads of Government, therefore, are obliged to do much better. The responsibility they bear is thus much greater. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Intergovernmental Conference is only an assembly of all the governments. It is quite clear that, in this historic process of giving Europe a constitution, it is no longer the Intergovernmental Conference that enjoys the greater democratic legitimacy, but the Convention. I would therefore see it as quite utterly unacceptable for the Intergovernmental Conference to wreck the political substance and hence the political compromises that the Convention arrived at.</p>
<p class="contents">Few are saying this – although Mr Voggenhuber has done so in very clear language – but the thought is in the minds of many that the issue of whether the Intergovernmental Conference should alter what came out of the Convention, is also a power issue between the governments and parliaments of the European Union. It has to be made perfectly clear that any change in what the Convention produced would be a vote of no confidence in the parliaments, which made up a majority in the Convention. That would certainly have an effect on the process of ratification, whether that be by the parliaments or by referendum, and hence on public acceptance of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, you always took a very progressive line in the Convention. We did a lot of work together, and we did it well, but now I am disappointed in the Commission, which accepts the position of certain governments rather than that of most of the parliaments, which do not want any alterations to the Convention’s draft. As I see it, this indicates that the Commission is not up to date. Nor do I know what the IGC is meant to produce by way of a positive outcome. You can just imagine how they will again be haggling, the sort of cattle market it will turn into, and things can, in fact, only get worse. I am not very confident about all this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and I were rapporteurs together in Nice, when Parliament demanded much and got little. With the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report, we are now asking for little and hoping to get much, by which I mean that we are hoping that the IGC will change nothing, and that would be a great deal. I congratulate Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos on having formulated this in such exact terms in the historic period in which we find ourselves!</p>

We would obviously have preferred the text proposed by the Convention to be more advanced in terms of the process of integration but we realise that the compromise reached is the only one possible, and it is this that we need to admit by agreeing with President Giscard d'Estaing’s statement when, opening the work of the Convention, he said that our unity is the reason for our existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a text that has such broad backing cannot easily be modified by the Intergovernmental Conference, except in some minor aspects. There is, however, only one issue, the most important issue, on which we need to put pressure on the Intergovernmental Conference, namely the rules for the revision of the Constitutional Treaty. If every single amendment to the Constitution is to depend on the unanimity of the 25 or 27 – or, in future, even more – Member States, then the risk is that this great step in the history of Europe will ultimately serve to constrain on Europe’s future and put an end to its hopes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need look no further than the overwhelming vote against the euro in Sweden and the stinging defeat suffered by Commissioner Lamy at Cancún. There is also the faintly ridiculous arm-wrestling between the Commission and France over both the Stability Pact and the Alstom affair.

<p class="contents">For my part, I would not lose sleep over whether to align myself with Parliament, the Commission or the Member States. It seems to me that the problem does not concern relationships between the European institutions. Rather, it concerns the relationship between the European institutions and the people of Europe.

I regret that the Tsatsos report does not make a clearer reference to this.</p>

Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos have done good work, and so we should endorse what they are basically saying, that is, that the consensus achieved by the Convention should not again be unwrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">There was, though, one area of the Convention’s work where consensus was no longer sought, in which a number of the ‘more equal’ in the praesidium ruthlessly forced through their interests and those of Europe’s ‘big boys’. The issue to which I refer is that of the composition of the Commission, the outcome of which was one to which the small and medium-sized states in the EU cannot say ‘yes’. A Commission in which not all the Member States were always fully and equally represented would lose the political legitimacy that meant that all the previous Commissions were fully-fledged players in the European Union. It might well survive as a perhaps more efficient body, albeit one consisting exclusively of technocrats. The Council would then cease to be part of the present balance and would start to assume supreme power. That cannot happen; it must not be allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of all Europeans, not only of those from the small and medium-sized Member States, we need the IGC to give a different answer on the one point where the Convention’s praesidium no longer sought the consensus of all. In the interests of all Europeans, we will need, in the future too, a representative and fully-fledged Commission with one Commissioner from each country, one that will carry political weight and really give every one of the EU’s citizens the feeling of being equally represented in all the European institutions. That is what the IGC must ensure; it should not do much more than that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite initial scepticism, the Convention has managed to strike an admirable compromise. The constitution will certainly contain things that we in this House would have preferred differently. However, the result still deserves our support. First of all, I should like to express my surprise at the fact that some, including the Dutch Government, argue in favour of including God – Christianity – in the European constitution. If this were done, where would that leave the separation of state and religion, on which modern democracy – the very foundation of our united Europe – is based? Is God not above the law? How can Liberal government parties endorse this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we indicated in the resolution that all Member States should hold referendums on the constitution, where possible, according to the constitution, on the day of the European elections. I myself am a great supporter of a referendum. I think that an important decision about the European constitution cannot be left to Heads of Government alone. Such a referendum is likely to take place in my country, the Netherlands, and I am delighted at this, especially now that it transpires that more than 80% of the Dutch population intend to vote. Unfortunately, the Dutch Government appears very divided about the referendum and lacks a clear European profile.</p>
<p class="contents">That does nothing to help our citizens; on the contrary, it puts them at a distance. Europe achieves too little, is insufficiently transparent, has to contend with a democratic deficit and sometimes interferes in matters that can be dealt with nearer to the citizen. These are precisely the areas that we intend to improve by means of this constitution, which allows the European Union to function more effectively and more democratically and which, moreover, gives the EU a social and political dimension, and this is why we ask for the support of our citizens in the referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I urge the Heads of Government, and certainly also the Dutch Prime Minister, not to engage in backroom analyses where the constitution is concerned. Basic values, social fundamental rights and more democracy must be defended and not weakened by alleged national interests, which would send us back to this cursed backroom in Nice, where the government produced something of little consequence. I should like to thank both rapporteurs. Let us give Europe back to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first remark relates to the identity of Europe. I would mention the words of a great historical liberal: ‘Why we cannot help calling ourselves Christians’. The reference to Christian roots could help to strengthen the secular nature of a policy which continues to be undermined by indifference and love of power. Nevertheless, what we are calling on to unite Europe must not divide it. I am, in fact, convinced that the references to the human person and to peace, freedom and democracy, to human rights and to pluralism represent the synthesis in constitutional form of Christian and democratic values that inspired the actions of the founders of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The second remark concerns future revision of a compromise that the Intergovernmental Conference may be able to improve on, without reopening the debate on the institutional balance proposed by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The report condemns the fact that the unanimity of the States continues to apply to the Constitutions’ revision procedure, and continues to do so even in the future. I believe that the Commission’s opinion – mentioned here by Mr Barnier – must be supported, in other words that the IGC should pave the way for more flexible revision procedures that do not allow the right to veto, at least where the non-essential provisions of the Treaty are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two possible solutions. Either nothing is changed or everything is. In the light of the possibility of negotiations being reopened, everyone is hoping to improve everything and running the risk of ruining everything. I am aware that in this role-play, some people, including some Members of Parliament are ready to invoke God as a way of obtaining more concessions on other subjects. I will let them make their own decisions on this. I do not share this approach to organising our earthly life.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is coming to this forum with the 10% they want to change. I also have 10% I would like to change. I would like to see more qualified majority voting on social and fiscal matters. This would be the only way to put an end to tax havens and dumping. I would also like to see real coordination of economic policies and majority decisions in the field of foreign affairs. President-in-Office of the Council<span class="bold">, </span>there may actually be another way of tackling these negotiations. I shall now test it out. We need to establish what we are determined to retain, what we are not prepared to give up. I would now like to outline five such issues I am not willing to compromise on.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the fact that I think it is essential to retain the option of those countries engaged in strengthened cooperation to use the enabling clause. This is a technical point but it is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the status of the Charter. In my view it could be improved but not a great deal. It is therefore best to leave well alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is that of God. God has been left out of the scope of the Constitution. Unlike Mr Elmar Brok, I want God to be left where he belongs. This means he should be left out of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth issue is the legal basis for public services. This is a crucial point. I do not want any concessions to be made on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the issue of price stability. The ECB seems to have taken up the offensive on this again. In this regard, I believe the consensus that has almost been reached on Article 3 on the objectives of the European Union is a reasonable one. I therefore propose that God and price stability are left out of all this. I wish you good luck.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to suggest that transparency is the key to success. If you publish the proposals made by all the parties concerned, you will enjoy more widespread support than you could ever gain with the wheeling and dealing between the representatives of the Heads of State or Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as a planet’s gravitational pull captures everything that draws close to it, the courage of six states has resulted in a process of cooperation that has been spreading and becoming more profound right up to the present day. No end to this development is in sight, even though we have started to think about where Europe’s boundaries lie.</p>
<p class="contents">In business, there is the rule that ‘to stand still is to go backwards’, which, metaphorically speaking, is also true in politics. Thank God we did not stand still as Europe developed politically in the second half of the previous century. All our efforts were and still are rewarded by the reunification of Europe in peace and freedom. Despite many and varied economic problems, Europe still has the power of a planet to attract others, and many fine words have been said about this already today. By means of the Constitutional Treaty, Europe is meant to – indeed it has to – make a qualitative leap if it is to be able to get the better of the challenges that lie ahead. This House was right to denounce the outcomes of Nice for failing to do that, as they were entangled in national egoisms. The Convention was rightly described as ‘constitutional’, for its work shows the way ahead, over and above economic cooperation. It is on this basis that the Member States’ governments can and must show, at the Intergovernmental Conference, whether they are working with the future in mind or are trapped in the behaviour patterns of the past in clinging to national egoisms and national patronage.</p>
<p class="contents">The present text of the Constitutional Treaty points the way to the future. It should be changed only to improve what already exists. Many of us are concerned that what came out of Nice will not be enough to cope with the imminent enlargement, and that is why – whilst being obliged to the Presidency of the Council for what it has said – I urge the governments to do everything in their power to facilitate the new Treaty’s speedy entry into force, so that not too much time elapses between the governments giving their consent and the Treaty’s final ratification. It is now for you, Europe’s Heads of State or Government, to decide whether you want to take Europe forward or stand in its way for your own egoistic and nationalistic reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I acknowledge that the method has proved successful and that real progress has been achieved in comparison to the current treaty. Nevertheless, I would like to examine critically the three innate deficiencies of the draft Constitution identified in the Gil-Robles and Tsatsos report as requiring closer scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The election of a President by his or her peers on the European Council marks an unexpected strengthening of the intergovernmental structure. The latter should actually be weakening as Europe moves forward. This sort of monarch-president, accountable to nobody, could considerably weaken the Commission and call into question the responsibilities of each institution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has appreciated the danger. In its communication, it lashes out with a damning statement: ‘Someone who is not accountable for his/her action to any parliamentary assembly cannot exert influence over the <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> of the Council, which is supposed to be transparent and democratic’. Mr Barnier, it is for you to act now.</p>
<p class="contents">The second innate deficiency, highlighted by many, concerns the future Commission. It seems that no longer would all Commissioners enjoy the same status. It would be a complicated, confused system, and impossible to operate. It would undermine the collegiate system within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The third obvious deficiency is the failure of the Convention on the reform of the CFSP. On this matter, the conventioneers have patently failed to meet the expectations of the citizens. No doubt the conventioneers were under extreme pressure from those Member States wishing to deny Europe the right to follow an independent foreign policy. The totally unsatisfactory <span class="italic">status quo</span> remains. It is to be hoped that the IGC will dare to correct this obvious flaw in the new constitutional edifice. At the very least, it will be necessary to facilitate strengthened cooperation between those Member States who do not believe the United States of America is their overlord, with control over their bodies and souls. The lesson of Iraq must be learnt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All too often European citizens do not feel that this is actually the case. In fact, they feel as though their national identity is being forgotten. There are many ways in which this can be rectified and I personally feel the Convention could and should have gone further in this area. However, on a practical level, I believe it is essential for MPs and MEPs to work more closely together to ensure the correct transposition of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Gold plating is a phenomenon which affects every Member State to a greater or lesser extent. In the UK it is particularly harmful, harmful to our agriculture for instance. The Abattoirs Directive left the Commission as a twelve-page document, was reduced by the French to a manageable seven pages and expanded by the British to an unreadable ninety-five pages. Sadly, there are many other examples of gold plating in the fields of business and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">So why does gold plating affect the UK more than any other Member State? One important reason is because the UK, unlike other states, does not involve MPs in the transposition process. Belgium has a Federal Advisory Committee on European Affairs, made up jointly of MPs and MEPs. The German and Greek legislatures have similar arrangements. As an MEP who has been an MP in the UK, I now realise how little my colleagues and I knew about the regulations coming from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems have deteriorated under the present British Government as it reduced the powers of our House of Commons. The way forward is for joint committees of members of national parliaments and MEPs to oversee the transposition of legislation into national law in every Member State. This would be a small but significant step in the right direction and, by increasing cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament, it would allow national MPs a real say in the workings of our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Which draft, though, do we see before us? Will this draft by the Convention give us fair and, above all, truly transparent decision-making structures? Will it bring about the unmistakeably clear separation of powers? Will enough decisions be taken by majority vote? Did not the governments brutally force through their positions, as one of the previous speakers, Mr Voggenhuber, put it? Will the small Member States lose out? Will only a few of the large ones gain anything, Mr Rack? Will the European Parliament become fully representative of the people? Can it now call individual Commissioners to account in any real sense? If we cannot, then can, at least, the voters? Are they able to directly elect the Commissioners? Will voters have direct influence on the decisions of the Council? In essence, will there be more direct democracy? John Palmer, of the respected European Policy Centre, and numerous German provincial prime ministers of varying political colours, have for years been saying over and over again, that if a country were constituted in the same way as the European Union, it would not be able, by reason of its lack of democratic legitimacy, to qualify as a Member State of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Will this new draft now do away with this fundamental deficit? Are our much-valued European regions not left out? What about the right of appeal? Will we now at last have the proximity to the citizens that we have so often invoked? Is the draft so clear and comprehensible that young people will be able to get to grips with it and get some idea of what Europe is? Will it not result in incessant wrangling and party-political horse-trading? A strong social market economy is the key to social peace in Europe – does the constitution contain any of the framework conditions on which that is dependent?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to too many of these questions has to be ‘no’. That is why it now makes sense to convinced Europeans, among whom I number myself, to say ‘no’ to the text that is before us. In any case, there can be no democracy without transparency, and, to this deception, we have to say, ‘no, thank you’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There was a lengthy debate on whether it was necessary, appropriate and right to introduce a reference to Christian values – or even to God – in the text in question and in the text that will be adopted. I believe that, over and above the formal aspects – and I would not be sorry if a reference to Christian values could be included – and over and above the terms used, it is important to note that the text that has emerged, and is emerging as it develops, respects these values. I believe that the text shows considerable respect for Christian values: respect for human life and respect for the dignity of human life are, indeed, points of reference on which there has been much work in the Convention. I feel it is important to emphasise that, over and above the actual words contained in the text, there is a reference to our history, to European life, that has, of course, been influenced by and associated with Christian values.</p>
<p class="contents">The different stages in achieving a Convention, a Constitution, new Treaties, have, I believe, been useful. I am not a pessimist: on the contrary, I believe that the work that has been carried out, although slow, has, overall, been fruitful, even if there is still room for some more development.</p>
<p class="contents">I often think of what Europe could have been like without the Institutions that there are today, and I remember what our continent was in essence 60 years ago. I must say, therefore, that what has been done – in terms of the direct legitimacy of the public, the quest for ways of achieving consensus and the management of the institutions and consensus – can be considered to be positive overall.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people maintain that there is still a great divide between the institutions and the citizens. Perhaps these very citizens should be involved in the evolution of Europe to a greater extent; perhaps it falls to us to recognise rights and to ensure that, through an important principle – justified expenditure, effective and appropriate bureaucracy – the divide between the institutions and civil society can be bridged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They might have laid greater emphasis on our satisfaction with the draft Constitution for Europe, and at the same time warned the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of the responsibility it will assume if it tries to replace the Convention’s political consensus with a different, governmental consensus. We all share in that responsibility, in that risk, especially those who, in accordance with the will of the citizens, cannot accept an enlarged Europe lacking a common legislature, or one strictly governed by an obsolete Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous representatives of the 28 Member States spent 16 months considering all the options in their quest for a reasonable consensus. I do not believe, Mr President, that European diplomats can do any better in little more than two months. In any case, those diplomats were involved at every stage in finding solutions on behalf of their Member States, which makes them partly responsible for the results achieved in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, I do not believe that any amount of political modesty can hide our pride in affirming clearly that, at the end of the European Convention, the highest honours went to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can any nationalist neuroses make us forget how valuable European unity is for governing Europeans, and, of course, for curbing the supremacy – and very often the stupidity – of other parts of the world. Our unity has thus become an essential tool in the service of peace. No delusions of grandeur or mediocrity can jeopardise the challenging mission which is Europe’s destiny today.</p>
<p class="contents">The text submitted to the IGC is a broad and profound compromise. It may rouse the whole gamut of emotions, but it will not be denied its role as the precursor of a new Europe, based on democracy, human rights, equality and European solidarity. That fact alone gives us the mettle to champion it, and to convince the citizens to confer on it the title ‘Constitution for Europe’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are a project, on which work must be in continual progress. The codecision procedure is becoming the rule and unanimity the valid exception. The citizens’ parliament’s legislative competence is being extended more than twice over. The way in which the national governments share responsibility for European decisions is being made more transparent, so it will be harder to make accusations, and the information given to the public will need to be more honest. Two of the constitution’s fundamental pillars of governance are the subsidiarity principle and the environmentally responsible market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, criticism. Aspects that have been criticised and cry out for amendment include the current proposal on the composition of the Commission, unanimous voting on taxes relevant to the internal market and on the Common Foreign Policy, as well as the absence of a common information campaign and of any requirement that the public be involved in the process of ratification. It is because Europe needs European awareness, an awareness that only information can create, and because we need our citizens to be informed and involved, that I advocate – even though the legal basis for it is not yet in place – a Europe-wide referendum, to take place at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament. It is because we have to inform, because we have to make citizens participants – and what could be more vital than to pro-actively tell the public about the European constitution, with its fundamental rights and civil liberties for citizens and to enable citizens to participate? I call on the members of the Intergovernmental Conference to hold a Europe-wide referendum to introduce the process of ratification, and I call upon my fellow Members of this House to endorse my statement to this effect.</p>

<p class="contents">The work of both the Convention and the rapporteurs is certainly positive; therefore – in answer to the pessimists and to those who always say no – I would say that, in terms of a complete Constitution, we are obviously only half way along the road but, compared to Nice, we have made steps forward that were and are giant steps. It is, however, necessary to make some changes to this report, as President Prodi, whose opinion I share, stated before this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point that I would like to mention is unanimity. I believe that, in requiring unanimity for constitutional amendments of minor importance too we would certainly be closing the door to future developments. We must endeavour to be more farsighted and more open, and, to this end, I, too, endorse the spirit of Amendment No 20, for which I will vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding my second point, the reference to God and Christianity, I find the uncompromising position of certain sections of this House incomprehensible; indeed, it is in conflict with the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the population. As regards Christianity, above all, if we do not include a clear, firm reference to it in the Constitution it will be tantamount to disowning our age-old history.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns linguistic and cultural diversity and the rights of minorities, referred to in Amendment No 22, recital H. I believe that the minorities that were referred to in the Copenhagen criteria should have a place in this report as well. I urge the Italian Presidency to make every endeavour to this end, both before and during the IGC, and to ensure that these minorities are mentioned in the Constitution too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just want to thank all the Members who spoke and made a valuable contribution to the debate which sees us all committed to creating a new, effective European Constitution: I would therefore like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what will be a precious contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Presidency is right not to discuss the merits of each individual issue, for the issues will, of course, be reflected upon and discussed during the Conference itself. I believe, on the other hand, that it is right to take on board the general sense of direction and the suggestions relating to transparency, first and foremost, and, from this point of view, I can assure you that the Presidency will make every endeavour to ensure the participation of the entire European public, not least by setting up a special web site.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the fundamental issue, which concerns the European Parliament and on which there was also an oral amendment from the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, namely the direct participation of Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I can only confirm what I said in the initial report, to the effect that the Presidency is in favour of making this possible. This does not, of course, depend on our own will; we could propose it again and try to support it with conviction because we are certain that the European Parliament can make a decisive contribution to achieving a positive result when the new European Constitution is drawn up. Since we, ourselves, are not, however, able to impose it, we can only take the message on board, make it our own and genuinely try to achieve a good result, in the hope that we will all be able to be present and to contribute to the achievement of this major, important objective that is the European Constitution.</p>

Parliament would hope that all the possible proposals would have been debated openly and that its conclusions would reflect the political will of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is considerable doubt surrounding all this, however. As I stated in the minority opinion attached to the Gil–Robles–Tsatsos report, the Convention was in fact nothing more than a think-tank set up by the Council. It was not representative and it did not have a democratic decision-making mandate. In addition, it exceeded its terms of reference, insofar as it was never asked to draw up a draft Constitution. This has now been universally recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the wish expressed by most governments to have what they describe as a genuine IGC, is therefore fully justified. They are calling for an IGC where meaningful discussion takes place, and where the original mandate is addressed. This concerned how to overcome the democratic deficit. The supranational proposals of the Convention would simply increase it still further. The way to overcome this deficit is rather to ensure European integration is better anchored on national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">National governments are the genuine representatives of their people. This therefore is the task they should set themselves at the IGC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
