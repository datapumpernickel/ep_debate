<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Donner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Thank you, Mr President. I would also like to thank you for the invitation to the presidency to exchange ideas with you about the multi-annual programme on Justice and Home Affairs. Not only have contacts already been established, but there is also a satisfying level of interest in the subject; for example, Mr Bourlanges and Mr Gargani attended the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 30 September and 1 October, which was entirely devoted to the multi-annual programme. The presidency has, of course, read the report that Mr Bourlanges has, as rapporteur, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. As I have already told the Council, this preparation offers the opportunity of distancing ourselves somewhat from current concerns and of considering the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency believes that the core questions are: ‘What should we in the European Union be capable of in five years’ time?’ or ‘What should the area of freedom, security and justice look like at that time in order to meet the then requirements of our citizens?’ The latter is crucial. The Area does indeed exist for the citizens and not the other way round. Thinking back to the discussions that have been held in the Council and to Mr Bourlanges’ report, it is evident that the Council and the European Parliament are, by and large, giving their attention to the same items. Accordingly, I can report to you that the proposals for political guidelines currently being submitted for discussion by the presidency deal with a considerable number of items mentioned in the resolution. It is indeed important that we can, in that way, give due consideration to this resolution when we reach the final stages.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to run ahead of this discussion. To date, only an informal meeting has taken place. I would, though, in this connection refer to such matters as the extension of the scope of the codecision procedure, civil rights, training police and judicial authorities, mutual recognition and, linked to this, common minimum standards, contingency plans, reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust and also the items concerning immigration, combating illegal immigration, asylum, repatriation and border control. Those items are also addressed within the meaning mentioned in the resolution. Needless to say, preventing and fighting terrorism is also an item on the agenda. At the same time, although – as I also said in the Council’s introduction – terrorism is at present an acute threat, cooperation in the framework of the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be based on that. It will instead need to be founded on the positive interests and added value that it brings with it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resolution, I should like to mention one more point, namely the proposed extension of jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The presidency has deliberately not adopted this item, the reason being that with the already increased workload as a result of enlargement, it would be irresponsible to burden the Court now immediately with the jurisdiction across the board of Justice and Home Affairs. As you all know, preliminary rulings at present take more than two years. By accepting the decisions in the field of asylum and possibly also in the field of criminal cases, preliminary rulings can be sought about the interpretation of Community directives in current policy matters. It is unacceptable that in those procedures, two-year timeframes should apply to legal proceedings where these involve people being detained for that time. The Constitutional Treaty allows for these eventualities by insisting, in Article III-369, on the prompt handling of cases involving detained persons or aliens in custody. It follows that the presidency is of the view that additional measures will be needed to enable the Court to implement this provision. This necessity has also been mentioned in the draft conclusions. It is therefore not a question of whether or not extending the Court’s jurisdiction is rejected but rather about making a different choice with regard to the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I have read with much interest what the resolution specifies about the decision-making by qualified majority in the fields in which this is already provided for in previous treaties. There are proposals that go in a direction that is certainly backed by the Netherlands and the Dutch Presidency, and I hope that it will be possible for the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and possibly the European Council at a later stage, to make an important step in that direction. The discussions about the draft conclusions will be held in the next few weeks. The intention is for the Council, composed of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers, to reach a political agreement on 26 October on the whole package, upon which it will be possible for the European Council to finalise matters on 5 November. Perhaps I might be permitted to end my introductory speech at this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its chairman, Mr Bourlanges, for its constant support in developing the Tampere Agenda over the past five years.</p>
<p class="contents">My participation today in this debate is extremely simple, because I could limit myself to saying that I welcome the resolution tabled by Mr Bourlanges, virtually in its entirety. This would help me beat the brevity record to which you referred, Mr President, but being so brief would naturally set a terrible precedent for my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall add just three brief points. The first of these, to which you have just alluded, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that I feel that the next European Council should celebrate the decision that Article 67 of the current Treaty can be implemented in full, so that a range of issues can be put to the vote, by codecision and by majority, as the Treaties already allow at the moment. This decision will raise Parliament’s political profile, and will safeguard the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is crucial to introducing provisions in such sensitive areas as immigration policy, asylum policy and policies involving the citizens’ fundamental rights. I welcome the initiatives taken by the Dutch Presidency in this regard and I hope that they will be successful at the European Council of 5 November.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the question of priorities. A five-year multi-annual plan runs the risk of gradually taking on the appearance of a Christmas tree; everybody wants to see in it a little of what is closest to his heart. This programme needs a clear political profile, and that political profile must be the result of setting out a crucial number of priorities in such a way that people can understand them. I feel that Mr Bourlanges has touched a raw nerve.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that the main priority at the moment is to step up cooperation at operational level – cooperation between security forces, between police forces and between judiciaries – in the fight against terrorism. We shall only be effective if we can build up an atmosphere of trust between the 25 Member States, which will help the security forces to cooperate more effectively in preventing terrorist attacks and in the fight against terrorism in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the second priority is the question of transposing legislation that has been passed into national legislation. A significant body of legislation has been produced over the past five years. The deadlines for transposing that legislation into the national legal order of each of the Member States must now be met and the mechanisms for ensuring the quality of that transposition must be safeguarded; in other words, national laws that give practical form to European laws must remain faithful to the spirit of the European laws and be subject to necessary and adequate quality control.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for Parliament to send out a strong message to the Members of the European Council. Indeed, the Commission, for its part, set out its priorities clearly in the communication that we sent out in June of this year. In the dialogue with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were able to enter into greater detail on these matters. What I should like to reiterate, therefore, in this final debate, is that what the Commission has found – based on the public consultation that we have carried out, and in the process of tabling our own proposals – is that the citizens have three fundamental concerns. The first is that priority should be given, on the one hand, to civil and commercial justice, to cooperation in the field of criminal justice, and to the fight against terrorism, and, on the other, to joint criminal trials that ensure compliance with the values of the democratic rule of law and to pro-active action in protecting all victims of crime and, in particular, victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern is a strong desire to see the completion of the second stage of developing a European asylum system based on common procedure and on a common statute for recognising refugees and asylum seekers. Thirdly and lastly, there is clear concern over security issues. While the citizens have shown that they recognise Europe’s added value in the fight against terrorism, there is work still to do as regards demonstrating the importance of certain common instruments that have been created, such as Europol and Eurojust, and the need to ensure that, in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, the legislation that has been introduced guarantees that the general public’s fundamental rights and personal information will be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that probably one of the areas in which the past five years have been less productive is that of regulating legal immigration. I appreciate that, with regard to this question, we are still a long way from creating the conditions needed to approve joint legislation. Let us be under no illusions, however; over the next five years priority must be given to common regulation and a common legal immigration policy for the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore like to leave you with the message that I am sure that, with the acknowledged efficiency of the Dutch Presidency and with Parliament’s extremely substantial and welcome contribution, the multi-annual programme for the next five years will be taken forward successfully by my successor, whom I wish every success in building Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Dutch Presidency, which ever since it came into office has demonstrated a very great capacity to listen to the European Parliament, and in particular Mr Donner who has shown himself to be very sensitive to the arguments we have put forward in favour of using Article 67(2), for the purpose of extending qualified majority voting, codecision and, I hope, the guarantees associated with the Court of Justice to the whole of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Mr President-in-Office, that, where the Court of Justice was concerned, we should have to wait a little. I understand your reasoning and the difficulty you are in, but allow me to point out to you what a strange argument this is. Just because a hospital is overcrowded, are people told that they need only go elsewhere to die? The Court of Justice does indeed have problems. Fine, let us try to solve them but, in the meantime, this does not signify that people awaiting trial are not entitled to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us acknowledge, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the report I am presenting to you is evidence of the considerable unity of the committee I chair, a unity that has not always been in evidence. The central point of this report, and the one we are emphasising, is the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community. We think that qualified majority voting is a guarantee of efficiency, and we think that codecision is a guarantee of democracy. We would add that supervision by the Court of Justice is a guarantee of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, what is the Council’s position in this case? With the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, you have the legal option of implementing the extension. The political will would also seem to be there, since all the governments have agreed upon a draft Constitution or Constitutional Treaty that provides for this extension. If, then, both the option and the political will are available to you, allow me to say that you have a duty to implement the extension, unless – most untypically for you, Mr President-in-Office – you are to give way to heaven knows what schizophrenic tendencies that are apparently causing worry within the Council. If, at institutional level, you have a great many things to do in support of the Constitutional Treaty, you therefore have something specific to do in this particular area, in order, as you have said, for this momentous change to take place in April.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the issue of transparency in the Council. There are a lot of things I could emphasise, for example the protection of fundamental rights. This Parliament sets great store not only by the protection of fundamental rights, but also by their promotion. All European legislation must be aimed specifically at extending these rights and at their not simply being perceived in the light of any distortions that they might undergo. This is a change of direction that also makes us want to see the human rights agency quickly put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding asylum and integration – highly sensitive subjects at the present time that, much more than other topics on the agenda, have certainly been at the root of a number of worries on the part of the members of my committee – let me state very clearly, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that, if there are to be detention centres for asylum seekers, the central issue, on which everything depends, is that of being clear about what is the administrative and legal authority that has jurisdiction over these asylum seekers. It is inconceivable, as far as our committee is concerned, that it can be any authority other than that of a Member State or of the European Union itself. In this context, a wide variety of solutions must be considered, provided that there is no desire to impose upon people placed in these detention centres conditions of semi-imprisonment such as are seen in certain places. In any case, we are convinced, where this point is concerned, that the problem will not be resolved without increased financial solidarity. Mr Vitorino thus appealed to the ‘Justice and Home Affairs’ Council as follows: if solidarity is to be exercised, money is required.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude with a few words on terrorism and fundamental rights. I would highlight the following paradox, which surprises me. Now, at a time when everyone would like police forces to be able to exchange information but when, however, prudence is the order of the day when it comes to the transmission of data, the following situation arises: police forces clearly have a lot of difficulties exchanging information, whereas data is spread to every corner of the world under unsatisfactory legal conditions. We are expecting the November Council to restore some logic to the matter and to ensure that people’s fundamental rights will be guaranteed where data protection is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his report, Mr Bourlanges is right to demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be made the pillar of future policy and, to quote him, that they – that is, the fundamental rights – should be ‘applied everywhere and at all times with the same rigour’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of many Members of this House, however, these lofty principles fail them when it comes to decisions at home. Freedom of opinion? – yes, that is self-evident, but the opinion must accord with the views of the Member in question. If not, then the dissidents can expect, at least, to be banned from any participation in the work of the European Union. They are then left, at best – if I may use our President, Mr Borrell’s words – to look after beetroots.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of religion? – of course; it is one of our fundamental freedoms, but you should, if at all possible, be a Shintoist, a Confucian, a Moslem, a Buddhist or a Wahhabi. If you are a Christian, or a Catholic, then Social Democrats, Liberals, Greens and Communists will declare that such antiquated thinking makes you incapable of implementing the values of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-discrimination? You are allowed to be incapable, but not to be a Christian. If that is not discrimination, what is? It is a tragic irony that certain members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, while fondly imagining themselves to be a bulwark in defence of fundamental freedoms and rights, are at present treading these rights underfoot. Mr Bourlanges’ fine report should encourage us, for we may demand much, but it is for each of us as individuals to act in accordance with the standards we ourselves set.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roure (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, at the 5 November Council, the Member States are going to decide upon new political directions in pursuit of the area of freedom, security and justice. Given Europeans’ growing expectations in this area, it is essential for us to be ambitious in defining our new priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have arrived at a crucial moment for the area of freedom, security and justice. What is certain is that many advances have been made since Tampere. The ambitious objectives then set enabled the European arrest warrant to be adopted, albeit with difficulty. This is an essential tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. We have also managed to define minimum standards in the field of asylum, even though we might lament the fact that these are bottom-up standards. Even so, the overall outcome is still unsatisfactory. The results obtained fall well short of what we might have expected following the Tampere Summit. There is a striking lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and the unanimity rule has, in many cases, reduced us to paralysis. As a result, the Member States have failed to transpose European decisions in good time. Implementation of a large part of European legislation has, at best, sustained unacceptable delays.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of asylum, the unanimity rule has reduced us to settling for the lowest common denominator. The European context should, on the contrary, permit upward harmonisation, particularly when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights, asylum procedures and the fight against forms of discrimination. Finally, European immigration policy has been reduced by the Member States to its repressive apparatus. Thus, the Council has adopted, against Parliament’s advice, provisions for joint flights for the purpose of removing refugees. As we have all said, insufficient efforts are being made to permit legal immigration. Unfortunately, the last ‘Justice and Home Affairs’ Council does not augur well. The EU’s part in supporting the creation of national asylum systems in Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya again conveys the impression that the Member States’ priority is to push the problems back outside their borders. Nor must the debate on the handling of asylum requests and on transit camps outside the EU ever lead to asylum being dealt with externally.</p>
<p class="contents">The new priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice must, above all, enable all the European decisions adopted to date to be implemented. The new objectives that have been set must, among other things, do more to promote fundamental rights and genuine harmonisation of asylum. I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what has become of the directive relating to minimum standards concerning the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status. Steps should also be taken in future to ensure that the Member States are forced, within the period allowed, to transpose European decisions into national law. It is, finally, essential that the European Parliament be fully involved in the area of liberty, security and justice. I would thus appeal to the Council to follow the lead of our rapporteur and chairman of our committee, who asks the Member States to take the decisions necessary for codecision to be applied in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make use of the few seconds remaining to me to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the work of very high quality that he has undertaken and pursued with the European Parliament. It is customary to say that no one is indispensable, but when someone is right for the job, they are missed when they are no longer there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the next five years of constructing an area of freedom, security and justice, we need effective and coherent action, democratic legitimacy, legal certainty and respect for fundamental rights. That would be a great improvement over the last five years. In spite of the valiant efforts of Mr Vitorino – whom I salute and will greatly miss – even he cannot work miracles on the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at effectiveness. As the Commission’s communication said, the justice and home affairs dimension is now firmly identified as one of the Union’s priority policies. However, when the Commission cites the volume of justice and home affairs business being done in the European institutions and the regular appearance of such items on the European Council’s agenda as evidence of their vital importance, I fear the wrong benchmark has been chosen, for while justice and home affairs generates 30% of translation work in the Council, it only produces 5% of the decisions. We also know that intelligence and police liaison is inadequate: the German and Spanish authorities had different bits of information that could have identified the 9/11 terrorists, even if it could not have prevented that atrocity.</p>
<p class="contents">The record of implementation of EU decisions that are taken is poor. Italy, the country in which Mr Buttiglione is still a minister, has not implemented the European arrest warrant. Meanwhile that country is breaching the UN Refugee Convention by deporting migrants to Libya and preventing their access to an asylum determination procedure. Therefore, coach and horses are being driven through the rule of law by the government that purports to supply the next Commissioner for Freedom, Security and Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU record on upholding fundamental rights, already fragile, is at risk and needs to improve radically. The measures on asylum and immigration in the last five years are incomplete and unbalanced and have incorporated some of the worst aspects of national policies. In particular, we have made almost no progress on avenues for legal immigration. No wonder the smugglers and traffickers are laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We face increasing threats to privacy from various directions, including proposals for traffic data retention, transfer of air passenger data, profiling, merging of various databases, etc. Meanwhile, data protection authorities are under-powered and under-resourced and there are no European rules specifically for the criminal justice area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must uphold our standards and values in future, not erode them further. The EU should seek positively to raise standards of protection of citizens’ rights and a culture of respect for fundamental freedoms in order to create the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition. The Human Rights Agency, which I hope will be set up soon, should monitor and evaluate against the standards in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but certainly not least, we urgently need transparency and democratic scrutiny. Why, as Mr Bourlanges said, is the Council dragging its feet and defying the Treaty of Nice, which requires a semi-automatic passage to codecision as well as qualified majority voting? The myriad of arrangements on judicial and police cooperation between national officials – not eurocrats, let us note – need to come within the ambit of parliamentary scrutiny, as do the activities of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That being the case, I cannot believe, listening to you, Commissioners and members of the Council, that we are heading towards reinforcing our common asylum policy and promoting fundamental rights, when we allow to take place, under our very eyes and without any reaction on our part, what is nothing but a wholly illegal act of force, seriously damaging our desire and our efforts – laborious as they of course are – to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy. Which country, moreover, does the EU nation concerned choose as a place to which to send those who have been expelled? It turns to a country that is notorious for attacking human freedoms, for acting outside any legal framework in arresting and persecuting people, for giving immigrants the worst possible welcome and for carrying out acts of torture. This country is, moreover, regularly targeted and cited in international reports. There are therefore many ways in which it breaches several European and international undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not genuinely think that our desire to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy could survive our silence – and, in my view, a culpable silence – regarding what is happening. Any Member State could see such silence as an opportunity to put in place bilateral agreements that would totally undo our laborious efforts to devise a common policy. I would therefore ask you, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, to express your total disapproval of this type of agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report’s nicely polished exterior is, however, a legal ‘Potemkin facade’. Firstly, the whole project of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice is, first and foremost, a device for bringing about a federal EU. It is that outcome, and not a concern for justice, that gives the project impetus here in Parliament. Federalism in conjunction with supranational power means, however, a weakening of the legal systems that have their democratic basis in the Member States. Secondly, the report overlooks the threats to the rule of law presented by the construction in recent years of huge police and monitoring systems – Schengen, Europol etc – which cannot be monitored and of which it is impossible to take an overall view. There lies the real threat to the state governed by law. There is nothing in the report about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the report fails to restore the balance between security imperatives and respect for human rights, in favour of the latter. That is a quotation from one of, in all, eleven amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which, together, serve to remedy the report’s striking deficiencies in one practical field, namely respect for immigrants and asylum seekers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have the impression that the new African leadership has far clearer ideas on the subjects in question than someone who talks about such problems from a rather theoretical viewpoint. They can see with their own eyes the activities of criminal and Mafia organisations, which organise illegal immigration and carry it out, and which in fact devise ways of exploiting the methods and rules which lay down the right of asylum so that they can organise illegal immigration. The African leaders alert us to such manoeuvres and activities and say that they are ready, provided that they are supported by the European countries from the social and economic point of view, to activate control procedures and policies, including police procedures, on African territory. That is what the new African leaders are saying, and they are clearly more realistic and take a much more practical and serious view of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore do not agree with many aspects of this report, particularly where, as supporters of the sovereignty of individual Member States, we hear requests, even on such a sensitive issue, for a qualified majority vote and even for it to be brought in early before the Constitution enters into force. We believe, in contrast, that Lampedusa actually demonstrates the importance of the role still played by the countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to conclude, I ask myself where the European Union was and where the Commission was when we needed to set up an emergency office to protect the victims of terrorism. Where was Mr Prodi’s European Commission when European citizens were, as they are now, in the hands of terrorist criminals, at the mercy of their blackmail, their assassins’ methods, their threats and their barbarous actions? Where was the European Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, it is thanks to a thirst for freedom that the European Union exists today, as freedom provided a basis for its creation. It is thanks to the thirst for freedom of seven of the new Member States, which for half a century were subject in turn to German and Communist domination, were able to join these institutions and become fully fledged members of the European Union. The two main threats to freedom today are terrorism, and immigration, in that order. These threats, may also be perceived as a challenge. We must rise to it, find a way forward, and deal with the issue of immigration once and for all. Rising levels of crime represent the next obvious threat to freedom. I would also like to draw particular attention to the threat to freedom posed by the intrusion of the state into areas of life to which it should not have access, namely areas of private life. This is an extremely serious problem, because it really is a major threat to freedom. New technologies also pose a great threat, as they make it possible to monitor citizens to a much greater degree than has previously been possible. The challenge facing the European institutions and all Europeans is to strike a balance between the desire for a peaceful and safe life and the wish to live in freedom. I would like to ask whether some of the members of the Commission who voted against Mr Buttiglione were not by any chance guided by religious criteria, thus violating the extremely serious issue of religious freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A very novel and original concept was thus concocted by way of a criterion for accession to our area of freedom, security and justice. So it is that torture is allowed these days, provided that it is not carried out systematically. It follows that in the Commission’s opinion, there is no longer a fundamental human rights problem in Turkey. According to the recommendation, Turkey respects priority being given to international law, the rights of the Kurdish minority are finally respected – albeit only verbally – and the Turks finally enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms. What happens now, though? On the very same day on which the Commission qualifies Turkey as a constitutional state, the Austrian newspaper <span class="italic">Der Standard</span> reports that 14% of the asylum applications from Turkey are recognised, and as Reinhard Müller stated only two days ago in the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>, refugees are people who have fled their countries of origin out of reasonable fear of persecution. It follows that these asylum applications are either justified and human rights are still being violated in Turkey, or Erdogan is right in his cynical claim before the Council last week that organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are indeed linked to international terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to restrict myself to two comments on what this new stage in the development of the European policing area of freedom and justice may mean.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that, in the field of security of the Tampere Summit, I would stress two initiatives which I believe have been very significant in terms of creating this area. Firstly, the European arrest warrant, which was undoubtedly the consequence of the horrendous attacks of 11 September, and secondly, the action plan against terrorism, which was also the consequence of the horrendous attacks in Madrid, initiatives which we owe largely to Mr Vitorino. Today, I believe, is a good day to acknowledge this.</p>
<p class="contents">An area of freedom and justice, however, cannot be built on the basis of responses or reactions to attacks and we do not want to see the third significant initiative relating to this area being taken following attacks. We must be capable of replacing reaction with initiative and replacing isolated measures, although they may be part of a plan, with a genuine political plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The second consideration must provide us with a methodology on which to base this second phase in the development of the area. Firstly, diagnosis: the Council must ask the governments what the main security problem facing those countries is and we need to identify the main problem affecting the security of the Europeans. Like Mr Vitorino, I believe that today it is Islamist terrorism and that, in my view, is the main security problem facing the Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following this diagnosis, we must understand that a political project is more than an action plan; it is not simply a series of measures, it requires effort by the governments, the Council and the Commission in order to deal with the problem. Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion. We have to decide how we are going to deal with a specific terrorist organisation in a specific way. And, after the diagnosis and after the political project, we will then know exactly how to shape and define a European police and judicial area. But that is the order in which we must do things, not the other way round, as is the case sometimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that a European area of freedom, security and justice must be twinned with the diagnosis of a problem and must be efficient in order to resolve problems. And if we are not capable of being efficient and if we do not relate the area to the resolution of the problem, there will be no common police and judicial area.</p>

<p class="contents">My main aim in addressing this House is to inform you of our basic demands in the light of our new political agenda. Firstly, I think it essential that a genuinely proactive policy on legal immigration finally be adopted. As, moreover, Mr Vitorino sincerely acknowledged a few minutes ago, it has, until now, been mainly the repressive side of asylum and immigration policy that has been given prominence and, as a result, many aspects of this legal immigration policy have been left on one side. Matters absolutely cannot continue in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words about the plan to construct, at the gates of Europe, so-called assistance centres for refugees, which are out-and-out camps. Let me tell you how totally opposed I am to such a project. It would in fact be an unprecedented retrograde step in Europe’s exercise of its responsibilities towards populations fleeing from conflicts and would show complete contempt for human rights, something that is absolutely unacceptable. Nor, certainly, can we be reassured by the recent declarations made by the Commissioner-designate, Mr Buttiglione, nor, for that matter, by those I have heard made this evening by Mrs Klamt. Beyond the strict rules for administering migratory flows, there are equally elementary rules concerning respect for individual rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the priority given to the fight against terrorism, there is of course agreement concerning the basis and essential features of this fight, but there are two things we expect from the Council. The first is that it implements genuinely effective measures that go beyond mere statements of intent in the manner of the appointment, following the Madrid bombings, of Mr de Vries who was provided with no resources for taking action. Secondly, we want the fight against terrorism to involve seeking a balance between people’s security and people’s freedom and for us not to imitate our American friends who, in their battle against the terrorist enemy, flout the most fundamental of essential rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that the demands we are making seem to us to be absolutely indispensable and that we hope that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will finally give these demands a genuine hearing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The course of justice and security in Europe took a backward step when internal border controls were abolished. This has encouraged large-scale movements of people across the continent, not to say much illegal immigration, all of which provides a perfect cover and condition for those you fear most: criminals such as the traffickers in human beings, and terrorists. They are now free to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Independence Party will re-establish Britain’s border controls and take back the right to say who shall enter our country. For centuries we accepted people from all over the world, but in small numbers so that they could settle peacefully and productively. Now our crowded islands are full and we seek to balance the number of those coming in against the number of those leaving.</p>

Following the ceasefires in Northern Ireland, we have seen a marked diversion of terrorist muscle and effort, both Loyalist and Republican, to organised crime. The Provisional IRA is now a key player in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime has become the main source of income and wealth for Sinn Féin/IRA. IRA Army Council member 'Slab' Murphy is a leading crime boss in Ireland presiding over a border empire built on fuel smuggling. The IRA stands exposed by the Dublin Justice Minister as deeply implicated in organised crime centred on Dublin port. Serial hijacking of huge consignments of cigarettes is acknowledged to be the work of the IRA. The inescapable truth is that Sinn Féin, which masquerades as a democratic party and has two shameless Members in this House, is largely funded by organised criminal activity. Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland. Loyalist terrorists have also made organised crime their forte, particularly in the despicable drugs trade. They too stand exposed as the grubby gangsters that they are.</p>
<p class="contents">My call in this House is that across Europe, under the aegis of each nation-state, organised crime should be relentlessly pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Donner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Thank you, Mr President. In response to your last remark, let me say that I did my level best to do this and ascertained beforehand how much time was needed, and was given that amount of time, as a result of which I was able to plan my other engagements accordingly. I am truly sorry that the time factor prevented things from going as planned, but it is too late to make amends now. So I need to go. The Dutch Presidency will in any event still be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is not my last meeting with Mr Vitorino, I think it is appropriate to take this opportunity of thanking him warmly, also on behalf of the Council, for the cooperation between the Council and Commission in this whole issue. Thanks to his commitment, the European Union managed to make much progress. It was not least thanks to his personal charm that it was possible for the Council to reach compromises, and his insight has led to innovative solutions. I am indeed of the opinion that he was a sound Commissioner for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of freedom, security and justice, which we are in the process of building, has been the subject of all kinds of comments from various quarters. It was described as a step towards a federal Europe that would prejudice freedom and democracy, because the latter is established from the bottom up.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from a country where democracy was invented some time in the Middle Ages and took an awfully long time to prevail. One condition for democracy is that our communities can live in safety, which is what we are trying to achieve here. After all, cooperation among the countries of Europe implies that an alternative is found to guarantee that our citizens can exercise their rights in freedom and can live in safety. This freedom and safety are under threat, not primarily by governments, but mainly by those who are our fellow citizens. In a well-organised society, governments are the first guarantee for citizens’ freedoms and rights. Needless to say, these governments will need to be monitored and their powers will need to be curtailed, but the absence of an authority is generally the best guarantee for chaos in which the citizens’ rights are the first to be sacrificed. If, however, government action is based on fear, the rights are often also the first to suffer. It is becoming evident, however, that it is increasingly difficult for individual countries to deliver on those guarantees, so we are obliged to pool resources, provided that diversity and tradition in this regard are respected. As already stated, the most important freedoms that are liable to be pushed aside are the freedoms that are sacrificed in the face of crimes against the life of our fellow human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of terrorism has been mentioned in this connection. I have already stated in this respect that this is an important item at present, but that we should not make the mistake of using fear of terrorism as a basis on which to cooperate in this area within Europe. We must build on the added value of cooperation, on the actual interests and needs of society. It goes without saying that, in the short term, no effort should be spared in combating terrorism. Following the attacks in Madrid, the Council drafted a long list with the necessary measures. At a given time, the Council showed determination, albeit in another capacity, and adopted a directive and various measures in the area of safeguarding personal privacy. Those rules apply and are also enforced within the Union. In addition, there is cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs on the one hand and wider cooperation within the Union, on the other. Those two should not be kept separate in a schizophrenic fashion which would mean that in the area of justice and home affairs, everything should be duplicated in respect of what has already been achieved in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address a number of remarks that have been made here about the development and future of asylum and immigration policy. That is undoubtedly a key item and your Commission representatives who were present know that the presidency intends to make good progress on this score too in the coming months. Initially, this will inevitably involve striking a compromise and finding a basis that some will, at first sight, regard as a lowest common denominator. Taking that as a basis will, in fact, enable us to make progress at a later date by going into the detail of the matter. I have already indicated, and admit wholeheartedly, that the Dutch Presidency intends to put decision-making by qualified majority in place, precisely to make this possible. This can only be done, though, if the initial basis has been laid by unanimity and that we can continue to build on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Various things have been said in this House, about such things as what has allegedly been decided during the informal Council on reception centres in North Africa. Let me point out that our first responsibility and first priority are dictated by the fact that even now, people are still drowning in the Mediterranean on a daily basis in their attempts to reach Europe. Europe has regulated legal migration, but has failed to regulate illegal migration, which is what is at issue here. As has also been discussed during the informal Council, it is up to the Member States to find an answer to the question as to how we can solve this matter. In this connection, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council, talks were held with the High Commissioner for refugees, Mr Lubbers, but Commissioner Vitorino also gave his view on the external dimension of asylum and migration policy. The concern to find an effective and suitable solution to the issue in the Mediterranean was evident in these three speakers. This was also recognised by the ministers present. At the same time, it became clear that existing initiatives can be used as a basis for many things. Statements have been made here about the Italian State, and the presidency has in any case asked Italy about its approach to the issue and what action is taken in the case of people submitting asylum applications. The presidency has received the guarantee from the Italian Government that those people are admitted to the national asylum procedure and that the High Commissioner is involved in dealing with this. It is the case, however, that if no asylum application is submitted, people can be returned to the country of origin, or at least of transit. If people are picked up on the high seas, they can be taken back to the country of transit. It is then our responsibility to ensure that reception is possible in those countries of transit, which can also be done under the remit of the High Commissioner for refugees. This is not by definition an issue for the nation states. There was also the question about the directive for minimum standards with regard to the asylum procedure. The Dutch presidency aims to complete the decision-making process before the end of its term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few separate observations, particularly with regard to Mr Bourlanges’ initial remarks further to my comment about the Court of Justice. It is not the case that by extending the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in a field where absolutely no judges operate, judges will only now act. Immigration law and criminal law are fields in which there has been quite extensive legal protection in all the Member States from the earliest times. In this respect, the key function of the Court is therefore the uniform interpretation of provisions. I have noted that if the Union uses decisions to step on the areas of immigration and criminal law, this will necessitate a uniform interpretation. It is then the Union’s prime responsibility to ensure that the interpretation of those provisions in the procedures in which the freedom of people is at stake, is done promptly. If not, it will be true, as the saying goes, that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’. That is the Union’s first responsibility and that is the reason why I have highlighted this.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your remarks about decision-making by qualified majority, I have already indicated the presidency’s minimum ambitions on this score. In this connection, we will need to await the further course of events. With regard to your remark about the Human Rights Agency, I should like to say the following. As you know, the European Council took a decision on this in September, and the Dutch Presidency will ensure at the earliest opportunity that …</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 were the first to have to meet demanding requirements with regard to the protection of external borders, and in the course of accession negotiations the European Commission gave a very positive assessment of their efforts. Since 1 May 2004, these ten countries have participated in cooperation measures under the Schengen Agreement, yet a fundamental obstacle to their equal participation in such joint measures is lack of access to the Schengen Information System. This hampers reciprocal implementation of the commitments entered into under the Treaty with regard to legal assistance in criminal matters, such as the European arrest warrant, police cooperation and a common immigration policy. Consequently, for example, the new Member States are prevented from issuing uniform Schengen lists, and, most importantly, the time period during which checks must be carried out at the EU’s internal borders has been greatly prolonged. This problem is viewed in a negative light by the majority of citizens of Poland and of the other new Member States. It is difficult for them to understand why the pre-accession strategy, which the EU and the candidate countries took nearly ten years to implement, could not have ensured that the information system was ready to accept additional users on 1 January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, the European Commission and the Member States set a date of late 2006 for completion of the second-generation Schengen Information System. Currently, however, the estimated date is given as 1 May 2007. I believe the Commission and the Council should keep to the original deadline of 31 December 2006 as the date when the second-generation Schengen Information System must be ready for operation. Integration of the new Member States’ IT systems and transfer of data from the old system to the new system must also be completed by that date. The European Commission should make available to the Council the report containing positive evaluations and assessments by EU experts based on objective indicators of the situation at the eastern external border. I regret to say that press reports still uphold the stereotype and myth that the new Member States do not provide satisfactory protection of the EU’s common borders. I believe dissemination of appropriate information by the Commission would not only encourage recognition of the efforts made by the new Member States, but also help to ensure their positive impact was appreciated. During a hearing before our committee, Professor Buttiglione gave a very positive assessment of the state of preparedness for implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System at the European Union’s eastern border. At the same time he committed himself to accelerating operational measures in this field. I hope that, in planning the future of the area of freedom, the Commission and the Council will rise to the challenge of ensuring that freedom of movement for European citizens, one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms, is implemented as rapidly as possible without discrimination. This would be the fastest way of achieving the highest possible level of security. It would also enable us to combat terrorism more effectively. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a threat we have to face in addition to the threat from the nationalist terrorism of ETA, which is weaker than ever, it is true, but which still has the capacity to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">Islamic fundamentalist terrorism shares both ETA’s objective of destroying democracy and the fanaticism with which ETA takes action against its victims, who are always innocent, but they differ in terms of their strategy, their organisation, the way they act and the support they receive. So, in order to combat both, we must create this area of freedom, security and justice with a shared objective: to defeat them, arresting and bringing to justice the instigators and authors of these crimes and by matching our tactics, and also our strategy, to the size, the context and the structure of each terrorist organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent history has shown us that we are capable of acting together after an attack, but on the other hand we are incapable of mobilising all the instruments of the Rule of Law in order to prevent them. I will give you an example: the Council has adopted a series of framework decisions which have yet to be transposed into the national legislations of certain countries and, therefore, apart from the fine expressions of solidarity from their Heads of State and Government, they are not operational. What are they waiting for? What has got to happen? How many more trains have to be blown to bits before they understand that the fight against terror is our responsibility, that it is a tragedy for those who are victims of it, but that the policy for preventing it and destroying it must be European?</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder, ladies and gentlemen, whether the time has come, if such a case arises, for a State to be penalised for endangering the security of its neighbours by not applying common rules in the fight against terrorism. I know it is the third pillar, but it depends on political will. This situation can change. I would insist that it only requires political will. Should we penalise a State which does not comply with the Stability Pact but not a State which jeopardises the lives of its neighbours by not applying Community legislation? This is the tragic paradox.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it would be very useful if the new Commission could produce and present to Parliament an assessment report on the way framework decisions have been transposed into national legislations and on the added value they have provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am coming to an end, but please allow me to address Mr Vitorino very briefly: I know that, from our desks, we sometimes forget that the ultimate beneficiaries of political action are real citizens. I know you are not guilty of this, and I would like to say that, as a result of your tenacity, your work and your intelligence, many European citizens, many of my neighbours, have felt freer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know what it is, we know what it says. It is the reaction – multipartisan, objective, rigorous – of the politicians of a society trying to protect that society, trying to be self-critical of their own institutions and to identify what was not working within them.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, if we turn to Europe, we find these documents, one of which was produced yesterday by the Council. It is the Council report, dated 12 October, following the report by the Commission dated 8 June 2004, and it tries to fill the gap. What has happened with the framework decision on terrorism? These documents are almost clandestine, because big political decisions are made in public, yet this one is not. This is depressing. It shows that not even the Netherlands Presidency has given the Commission the answers it needs in order to produce these documents. But the Netherlands Presidency is not alone in this: only 13 countries out of 25 have done their homework.</p>

One after another, speakers have affirmed their belief in the Union and in its splendid achievements. What indeed can be more splendid than equality, freedom, brotherhood and an area of freedom, security and justice? But where is this area, I ask myself? Where is the justice and where are the equal rights, if you cannot even manage to provide interpreters during committee meetings, something all Member States and Members of this House are entitled to under the Treaties? Where are the justice, ethics and morals, if you fight against child pornography on the Internet, but at the same time promote access to pornography in general in the name of so-called citizens’ freedoms? Is this not a case of split personality and a peculiar schizophrenia? In my opinion, the European Union is currently at a crossroads. It is trying to build on quicksand, having rejected the principles of civilised ethics and Christian ethics, which have acted as a foundation for millennia. It is claimed that the spirit of the old foundation is being retained, as it is replaced by a new one, namely law and human rights. Yet at the same time I have sat through worrying debates, even within my committee, which is actually called the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I have heard of the need to combat the criminal actions of paedophiles on the Internet. Simultaneously various sexual deviations are being allowed to proliferate in the name of this very freedom. So I wonder, Mr President, whether this whole edifice is not set to come tumbling down. In the name of these principles, I would like to end by referring to a Polish poet who said that anyone who dares to take sparks from the devil’s forge to scorch the devil’s power blasphemes against eternal wisdom and forces the world into outer darkness.

The EU now faces the difficult challenge of successfully devising common legal rules for the newly enlarged EU and, soon, the even more enlarged EU. The demand for the rule of law must be the same in an EU both of 30 and of 25 countries. We Swedes are expected right now to extradite a 21 year-old, Kalle Jonsson, to Greece in accordance with a warrant for his arrest. Kalle Jonsson has been waiting to be tried since 2001. Is it fair that a young person should have to wait three years?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s legal system is based upon mutual trust: trust in each other’s legal systems. Most people in my country believe that the EU is about trade and the internal market. They have no idea that we have to recognise each other’s court judgments, and to do so also in the further enlarged EU of the future, irrespective of, for example, the circumstances of such recognition. The EU already has – and will have more – problematic areas within its own external borders. People need, at the same time, to be given the necessary confidence in the legal systems in all the Member States. That is more difficult than obtaining popular support for the treaty. If no such popular support is successfully obtained within the scheduled time, enlargement will be delayed, legal cooperation weakened or the rule of law even tampered with. Quite simply: how is the Commission successfully to carry out this task, or is the idea of its doing so utopian and a mere dream?</p>

We have to ensure that the EU continues to stand for openness to the world, for liberality and tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed that we must act decisively against international terrorism and organised crime, but the measures we take to deal with them have to be appropriate. To take one example, we set great store by the European arrest warrant, but, unfortunately, not everyone does. We, on the other hand, have no desire to take action for the sake of it, nor any headlong zeal for collecting every conceivable item of data about people, storing them for unspecified periods of time, and passing them on to every official body. The greater security this promises is illusory, and civil liberties and the protection of the individual, for which we have struggled for so long, must not be sacrificed to it. These values must underpin everything we do in the sphere of justice and internal affairs. Tampere I made that clear, and to that we must hold fast.</p>
<p class="contents">We still need a common asylum policy and a policy enabling us to bring illegal immigration under control and to prevent people-trafficking, without diluting or even abandoning the principle of solidarity.</p>

For Members to attack the purely personal views – and the right to express those views – of Commission candidates because they do not comply with their own is an example of intolerance which demeans our Assembly and the parties concerned. If those are the principles of socialism and liberalism, they are deeply undesirable in this place.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the main issues, we do not need a prescriptive envelope. It benefits us sometimes, in our area of freedom, security and justice, to have more bilateral and multilateral agreements, such as the agreement on joint investigation teams, an initiative I was proud to be involved in at the time. However, we do not cooperate enough. It is arguable that if we concentrated on more cooperation between Member States and organisations, instead of creating complex and over-reaching structures, we would achieve more practical results for our citizens and we would thereby encourage greater acceptance of the sort of Europe that they can really accept and benefit from.</p>

However, I want to make it clear that I think he has been an extremely effective and cooperative Commissioner and that he respected this House. That, in my view, certainly puts him into a top category and I wish him the very best for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe it is essential for the European Union to commit itself to a common anti-terrorist political strategy which is able, unhesitatingly and with the determination allowed by the law, on the basis of reason and the desire to protect lives, to neutralise any terrorist organisation that acts within our area of freedoms or from our area of freedoms. In that way we will enhance the credibility and trust in our democratic institutions amongst our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we cannot promote or enhance our freedoms or rights unless we are able to defend them. And those rights and freedoms are our greatest heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in order to contribute to this aim and this inescapable obligation we also need to respond to certain problems, such as the problem of asylum. We need a common procedure and effective measures to protect refugees and to tackle the mafias who run the cruel traffic in those refugees. We need common management of our external borders and, finally, it is essential to make great progress on judicial and criminal cooperation, particularly in the criminal field.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at the level of agreement between the Council and Parliament, despite the reservations on the competences of the Court of Justice. I would like to praise the Dutch Presidency for its sensitivity and to correct it: yes, terrorism is our principal and fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by congratulating Mr Bourlanges and particularly Commissioner Vitorino, with whose speech I agree entirely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In some respects, the situation we are facing in this plenary is a snapshot of what we have experienced over the past five years. The Commission has always been present, with Mr Vitorino’s intelligence and tenacity – and I wish to extend my greetings to him – and the Council, when it has not been absent, has proved incapable of making decisions. I look at the Council’s empty chair and I have the image of what has happened over the past five years in the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to believe that the European Council of 5 November will be what Parliament was asking for in Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s resolution. What we proposed was a Tampere II to evaluate the area of freedom, security and justice and to set fresh targets and timetables, with urgency and determination. I must say, Mr Vitorino, that I feel that the agenda for the 5 November Council, to which the Commission also contributed greatly, is a highly practical approach. I agree with the overall principles of the political guidelines for the multi-annual programme. The main priority must be to fight international terrorism by means of an across-the-board anti-terrorist strategy, at both EU Member State level and on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there must be a policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights and freedoms. Special attention must also be paid to aspects such as controlling migratory flows, running the Border Management Agency, starting up the Visa Information System (VIS) and the second generation of the Schengen Information System, and stepping up security in the area of travel documents and visas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to say to the absent Council that if setting up this area of freedom, security and justice is really one of the EU’s main political priorities, this must be clearly reflected in the allocation of sufficient funding in the coming Financial Perspectives. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an official language of the European Union and yet the interpretation booth up there is empty. These are shortcomings that are quite inconvenient and frankly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to take the floor to draw attention to the very serious situation that my country is facing on the issue of illegal immigration. During the first nine months of this year alone, 1 200 boat people landed in Malta. Some may think that 1 200 is not such an extraordinary number, but when you consider the size of Malta and its very high population density, one would immediately acknowledge that the situation is indeed very grave. To give you a clearer picture, 1 200 immigrants landing in Malta are roughly equivalent – in terms of impact – to as many as 140 000 people landing in Sicily. And this in the first nine months of this year alone. Therefore, the impact is massive and it is clear that my country needs support to be able to cope with this serious situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of illegal immigration, it is very easy to point fingers at others. It is less easy to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with a constant influx of boat people when you have insufficient means to cope with them. Therefore, as a minimum, we must acknowledge that this is not just one country's problem, or that of a few countries: it is a common European problem. As such we should seek a common European solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should therefore put its money where its mouth is and help the affected countries equip themselves better to cope with the situation. In particular, adequate financial resources should be allocated to help them improve their infrastructure and services to be better able to handle the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We say the European Union is built on the principle of subsidiarity. On this issue the time has come to move from words to action and to express solidarity in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This area of freedom and justice must justify its name in the coming years, not just on paper, but also in practice. The citizens of the New Member States in particular will not feel themselves to be full citizens of the European Union until borders are actually removed for all EU citizens. Unfortunately, the present documents do not adequately deal with existing problems regarding the implementation of the freedoms of European Union citizens, including the application of the so-called ‘variable geometry scheme’. I believe that existing divisions also need to be addressed more clearly in the European Council’s Tampere II programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We should avoid situations where citizens of third countries, for whom special regimes and regulations apply, are in a more favourable position compared to citizens of the New Member States. In the near future, one practical question requiring serious work is the enlargement of the Schengen system to include the new members as quickly as possible. We need to concentrate our political will, so that this opportunity can be created by 2007, not in theory but in practice. The Council and the Commission need to allocate funds for this, in order to set up the necessary visa information system and ensure the availability of experts to carry out missions to the New Member States. This process also involves targeted policies on the part of the European Union, which aim to bring to a conclusion the process of border agreement negotiation between the New Member States and their neighbours, for which the new members have done everything in their power.</p>

<p class="contents">In this area, too, our enlarged Union is facing new challenges, simply because our external borders have been moved, and we have to be able to guarantee that these will be well secured. A coordinated border policy is a priority, and the securing of our external borders must be jointly funded, but I regard with some scepticism the establishment of a Corps of Border Guards for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Our future objective must be the creation of common asylum law and clear rules on migration, with the fixing of quotas being reserved to the Member States. In this context, it is important that action be taken against illegal immigration. Sacrosanct though the right to asylum is, immigration cannot be a right. We also have to work towards greater cooperation with the states bordering the EU in dealing with asylum and migratory flows. The protection of our citizens demands that we take action against terrorism and organised crime, and, in the area of data protection related to this, it is important that we come up with a good compromise between counter-terrorism, our economic interests and the rights of citizens. Our policy must increasingly focus on combating child pornography, the traffic in women and drugs, corruption and on stabilising the Balkans.</p>

The European Union’s enlargement in 2004 was accompanied by a significant rise in applications for asylum in the new Member States. According to the predictions of the UN High Commissioner for refugees, who recently paid a study visit to Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, numbers will continue to rise at the present rate in these countries for at least the next few years. For example, following the escalation of the conflict in the North Caucasus, Poland is currently accepting the largest number of Chechen refugees. Since mid-September their number has risen by several hundred per cent. Every day, around 50 Chechen citizens cross Poland’s eastern border. Most of them are mothers with children, and a great many are unaccompanied children. Work on a common asylum policy needs to be stepped up, and measures should and must be taken to set up a joint funding mechanism based on solidarity between Member States, as well as an organisational mechanism for the integration of persons granted refugee status. An integrated system for border management and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders also need to be created rapidly. The Agency should commence its activities as soon as possible in order to establish common standards for protection of the European Union’s external borders. The most suitable place for the Agency to be located is Poland, as Poland has the longest land border in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that the new Member States will make maximum use of the Schengen facility to prepare themselves for the important moment when internal border controls are abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is about the Lampedusa situation. We recognise that the Italian authorities are under enormous pressure, but we have been reassured by the Italian Government that all those who arrive at Lampedusa asking for asylum are treated in accordance with international conventions, in particular the Geneva Convention. Therefore, their requests for asylum have been analysed by the authorities in the field. I would emphasise that it is up to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to verify the situation there.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to reiterate that the pilot project that the Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intend to develop in Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya does not include anything about camps. There is confusion on this point: the aim of the project is to strengthen national asylum systems. It does have anything to do with camps.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the views of several Members of the House who have emphasised the need to guarantee that in the next financial perspectives there are sufficient financial tools to improve solidarity in the management of internal borders and in the management of migratory and asylum flows. I hope that we can count on the support of the House on the Commission's proposal on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like very much to thank several Members of the House for the very kind words that they addressed to me. I left this House as a Member of Parliament ten years ago, and I am now leaving as a Member of the Commission. Goodness knows in what capacity I might come back!</p>
