<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's proposal for the extension of the Community action programme on civil protection for the years 2005 and 2006. I very much appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, in particular the work of Mr Papadimoulis, the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I go into detail on this report, I think it is worth recalling the work done under the auspices of this action plan since its adoption in December 1999. The objectives of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensure better protection for people, the environment and property in the event of natural or technological disasters across the Community. The action programme has funded a range of useful projects, exchanges of experts and workshops that build invaluable cooperation and also mutual assistance between the Member States' civil protection services.</p>
<p class="contents">The action programme supports and supplements efforts at national, regional and local levels. Emphasis has been put on major projects concerning prevention, information of the public, crisis management, disaster medicine and networking among the different volunteer associations active on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years we have seen major disasters. You will recall the floods in central and eastern Europe in the summer of 2002, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> oil spill, also in the same year, the unprecedented heatwave and devastating forest fires in southern Europe in the summer of 2003. This year we were shocked by the violent terrorist attack in Madrid and saddened by the earthquakes in Iran and Morocco. These events clearly illustrated the need for further action to strengthen prevention and preparedness measures and also to enhance our ability to respond rapidly and in solidarity as a European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection. The rapporteur has rightly highlighted some issues in the report, and these are both valuable and constructive remarks that we will take into account in our future work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to react immediately to a number of points. The report recommends 'better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies and practices at national level'. The Commission agrees that our database of resources should be further upgraded and contain more data on responsive capacities, associated costs and available equipment. The Commission is currently working with Member States on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The report argues for an improved operational framework for volunteers and for the establishment of guidelines for their work. This is a helpful suggestion and echoes the emphasis that the Commission is now putting on the work on this subject, which was and will remain a priority for financing in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the issue of financing assistance during emergencies. This is an issue of concern to us, but depends on having a sufficient level of funding available. For the time being the budgetary resources available only permit financing of experts who travel to the scene of disasters to assess needs for assistance. Additional financing depends at present on the donating and receiving Member States. I should like to add that there is also, as you know, the possibility to use the EU Solidarity Fund to provide compensation to a country suffering severe damage from a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report asks the Commission to provide a report on the programme in 2006. We have no difficulty in accepting this request.</p>
<p class="contents">With these remarks, I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thoughtful and constructive opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add that my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, sends his apologies for not being here. He is in Buenos Aires and asked me to replace him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this report comes, as the Commissioner noted, after a series of major natural disasters in recent years which raise the question of the need to strengthen the Community action programme: floods, heat-waves, forest fires, earthquakes, serious pollution incidents from toxic waste or oil spills, such as that from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, as well as serious industrial accidents and also terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Greece, is currently experiencing immense anxiety as the result of the hijacking of a bus with several hostages whose lives are in danger. These dangers and these disasters have many victims and cause ever greater economic losses; they disrupt the economies of the countries affected, hitting in particular the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the population. That is precisely why action also needs to be taken by governments, preventive measures need to be strengthened and response capacities need to be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community response to this problem is the Community action programme in the field of civil protection. This programme expires in a few days, on 31 December 2004, and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared, in order to avoid a gap until such time as the new programme is prepared. That is why I support the Commission proposal to prolong this programme for the next two years, just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annually, which was the amount in 2004, to EUR 2.4 million annually for the next two years. You may say it is not a big increase. I agree, but it is absolutely essential in order to finance increased needs due to enlargement and to finance the action programme to combat marine pollution which has been decided in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perception as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission, and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation. Otherwise, we shall not be consistent in our obligations towards the citizens and it is precisely at times of natural disasters that those who voted for us and sent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by their side. This programme therefore needs to proceed and, at the same time, certain points in it need to be improved on the basis of experience obtained to date.</p>
<p class="contents">In studying the problem, I have identified seven sectors in which improvements are needed in practice, because on paper the system looks good, but on the ground experience to date has shown that it has serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">One, better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies at national level. The database, its data and the capacity for fast communication and coordination need to be improved, in other words the computer database needs to be upgraded.</p>
<p class="contents">Two, more training for intervention teams. Experience has shown that more regular training is needed for better cooperation and interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, better communication, coordination, in-time information systems for the prompt information of the public and links with other networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Four, funding: not simply increasing funding but safeguarding speedier response with the release of the source of funding and concentrating all the appropriations needed under one heading.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities. Increasing the number of volunteers.</p>
<p class="contents">Six, empowerment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">And seven, implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and reinforcement of the drawing up of national plans for emergency coordination, a sector in which numerous Member States have serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons which I have described to you and so as not to be too longwinded, because it is already quite late, I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the greatest possible support, as did the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which approved my report almost unanimously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cross-border cooperation and a cooperation culture are fundamental, because the security of the countries in the European Union is closely linked to what happens on their borders. To that end, we must invest heavily in volunteers. In addition, we agree on the seven areas that need to be strengthened, in view of the deficiencies revealed at the level of individual nations. The European People’s Party also believes that the Commission ought to evaluate the implementation of the current programme before it ends and prepare a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the Community action programme is being extended to the years 2005-2006 without Parliament having been sent the mid-term report or the final report provided for by Decision 1999/847/EC establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. To date we have not even received any justification for the delay. That is a very serious failing, because it violates Parliament’s prerogative to give its opinion and forces it come to a decision without seeing any qualitative or quantitative information on the actions taken or the results achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Our confidence in the new Commission, however, leads us to hope that these reports will be forwarded by the requested date of 30 June 2006, precisely for the purpose – and in the hope – of promoting full cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission. Those documents should give us an evaluation of the extent of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection, together with the actions planned under the other two ongoing Community programmes, which will provide Parliament’s Committee on the Environment with useful suggestions for inclusion in the single action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 2007-2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel that it is crucial to extend this action programme and we also deem it important that in the two years concerned, 2005 and 2006, the Commission can make an accurate assessment of the current programme and can prepare a new and more ambitious instrument of action, taking account of the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013 and any needs identified in the meantime. New problems require new solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, therefore, endorse Mr Papadimoulis’s report – and I compliment him on his work – and we naturally support the Commission’s proposal to extend the programme. We do feel, however, that, bearing in mind the programme’s objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries, funding should be stepped up even further. The importance of civil protection continues to grow. Persons and property must be protected and this is an area that requires greater resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, as has been pointed out in this House, a number of natural disasters and criminally-motivated disasters have occurred, which have affected both the people and the economies of the countries concerned. Such was the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, the floods in the South of France, the terrorist attack on Madrid and the forest fires in Spain and Portugal. Coming from Portugal as I do, I am particularly sensitive to this issue, as you will understand.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, greater funding would be desirable so that we can better prevent and remedy situations of this nature. In Portugal alone, for example, in 2003, 400 000 hectares of forest were burnt and approximately 170 000 hectares in 2004. It is therefore essential that the next action instrument provides for greater financial support. The environment is priceless and our forests cannot continue to disappear. We have an obligation to preserve them so that we can leave them to future generations. We cannot forget that the Earth does not belong to us, it has been borrowed for our children. We must therefore step up measures aimed at prevention and cure. As far as prevention is concerned, there must be greater EU involvement, in conjunction with national, regional and local administrations, along with technical and financial support, to prevent these disasters, which occur year after year.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention is better, and indeed more effective and cheaper, than cure. With regard to restorative measures, coordination and monitoring must be stepped up, particularly in terms of reforesting the areas affected by the fires. It is worth remembering that the restoration of the Mediterranean forest has taken almost a hundred years. There are sectors in which we cannot make savings. As for civil protection, making savings might mean becoming irredeemably poorer and our collective future being severely compromised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me it seems not so much a free choice as a mandatory solution, without any alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached the end of the current programme without a lasting, concrete solution to the problem. That very fact shows just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is. I feel I have developed some modest experience in this field, as I chair the civil protection committee in Catania, the province of Italy most exposed to seismic and volcanic risk, and also because I coordinated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terrible eruption of Mount Etna in the summer of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agreeable topic for a round table or a pleasant, convivial get-together, but is a subject that is indissolubly linked to people’s safety and, as you know, safety is a physiological right before it is a constitutional right.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and scandalously dragging its feet in this area. The subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in theory but in practice suffer from serious deficiencies – as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself, whose work I admire. In fact, the approach seems schizophrenic not only at a logistical level but also because of the inadequate financial cover.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what results have the information monitoring centre, the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk forecasting and prevention, rather than of emergency and post-emergency management? What qualitative results have they had on European Union territory? Can we find out what their effect has been? Can we have a detailed report? Will people understand that a disaster may not always coincide with the borders of an individual state, thus becoming a supranational problem, as the oil slick from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> demonstrated? How can civil protection capabilities in Europe be allowed to remain fragmented among the areas of responsibility of the environment, health, territory, agriculture and internal affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">A European civil protection agency needs to be set up, something I asked the Commission to do two years ago. Apart from the fact that an operational structure can undoubtedly increase involvement, especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem, such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territorial level to develop and harmonise procedures and methods for analysing and mitigating the risk of natural and technological disasters, and it would establish a proper task force.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volunteers and to support it with structured training, equipment and funds, so that it can become an essential resource for dealing with emergencies and natural and other disasters. I hope that the Commission will find the strength, the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His proposals on integrated management and more efficient operation of the relevant mechanism and the extension of the programme, which we support, are also to the point.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienced disasters with the broadest, direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole. In response to these events, we adopted the Community action programme. As we all recall, we were overtaken by events and reacted after them. Let us take proper stock today, quantitatively and qualitatively, and let us look with the experience we have acquired at how we can improve the existing mechanism in all its functions and at all stages, from prevention to combating of disasters and the restoration of and return to social life. This relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes better exchange of information and best practices, more training for intervention teams, mobilising volunteers and better coordination between the agencies involved at European, national, regional and local level. As far as increasing the budget is concerned, it is necessary but, at the same time, the procedure also needs to be simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the issue we are debating tonight will receive the assent of the Council, because it is a very important issue. It not only resolves daily problems, but is also of major symbolic importance. The citizens feel the European Union in their lives with this sort of intervention. European nationality thus acquires a specific and deeper meaning. This sort of programme brings European institutions, national and local agencies and local authorities into direct cooperation, something in which we are lagging behind, both at national level and in terms of coordination between the European Union and the national agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">To the outside world, this sort of programme gives the European Union visibility and, more importantly, projects an efficient and humane face, something which, listening to you on the previous report Commissioner, you intend to make a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Coming from a country which has benefited in the past from EU funding in order to cope with natural disasters, I fully appreciate the importance of the programme. Indeed, as a former minister in my own government, I visited Brussels in 1995 seeking assistance to alleviate the effects of substantial flooding throughout the length and breadth of Ireland. I succeeded in obtaining considerable financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the increase in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 2005 and 2006 but, like other speakers who have contributed to this debate, when I examine the increase I note that it is a mere EUR 0.9 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006. I read the report in some detail and the justification for the increase is 'EU enlargement'. When one considers the fact that we are increasing the size of our Community and welcoming the accession of 10 new Member States to our Community, in real terms the so-called increase is actually a decrease; that is without factoring in inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see an emergency fund – I know you mentioned the Solidarity Fund – for civil disasters, where direct aid would be given to the regions of the new accession states, in the same way as Ireland was helped in the past. These states have freed themselves from the iron grip of Moscow. They all qualify for Objective 1 status; their economies are still largely embryonic. Just as Ireland found itself in civil disasters, these new countries will inevitably find themselves in situations where natural disasters will occur. I fundamentally believe that we should set aside each year a substantial fund to assist such countries by way of direct relief aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the rapporteur for his systematic approach and recommendations. He went through each area in detail. Prevention, where possible, is desirable; preparedness is vital; protection, emergency measures and recovery are all essential. I believe the scheme that he has prepared is excellent, but it is totally underfunded. We cannot foresee earthquakes, floods or forest fires – they are natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion,</p>

First I wish to thank you all – the rapporteur and all the Members of Parliament who have spoken – for your support for this programme for civil protection, which we all feel is <span class="italic">very</span> important. I also thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the question about how will this go forward, I can tell you that there will be no problem, there will be a prolongation. Coreper discussed the Commission proposal on 15 December, and it will go as an 'A' point – that is, one where there are no problems – to the Environment Council before Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that, in the meantime, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a new legal instrument with a view to its entry into force in January 2007. That means that this new proposal will be based on the provisions of the new constitutional Treaty for greater possibilities to develop European cooperation in the field of civil protection; and thus we will be working particularly in the field of prevention that you all mentioned, but also in the field of response.</p>
<p class="contents">The next two years will be a transitional period to prepare in the best possible way the venue for the new Treaty, which will include many of the items and elements mentioned here. You all spoke about prevention and nearly all of you mentioned the importance of contributions of volunteers and also of social partnership and the question of financing, which depends on the financial regulations. Again, we are ready to make the preparations, and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal. I hope that my colleague Commissioner Dimas will then be able to discuss this very closely with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
