<p>The Council and Commission are working closely together to tackle the current problems on the beef market. Decisions taken in recent weeks include action in the public health arena to restore consumer confidence and market measures aimed at reducing the impact on farmers.</p>
<p>It is the Commission's task to propose further market-related measures, such as the measure which the honourable Member proposes. At its meeting of 29 January 2001, the Council welcomed the Commission's intention to submit a package of measures, before the next Council meeting, towards resolving the problems caused by the imbalance on the EU market in beef, both short and long term, while at the same time improving quality on that market.</p>
<p>The Council will consider these measures promptly within the framework of the budget agreed at the European Council meeting in Berlin.</p>
<p>As you will be aware, on 12 February 2001, the Council drew up the proposal for supplementary and amending budget 1/2001 for the funding of a package of measures relating to BSE, which was agreed by the (agriculture) Council at its meeting in December. The package includes measures for additional costs of EUR 971 million, EUR 726 million of which are made up of funds from the margin available under sub-heading 1a of the budget. Those EUR 726 million will be entirely covered by the surplus from previous years. The remaining EUR 245 million are obtained from adjustments to the estimates of agricultural expenditure as a result of an adjusted euro/dollar exchange rate in line with Article 8 of Council Regulation 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 on budgetary discipline.</p>
<p>The Council has also noted and welcomed the seven-point plan presented by the Commission yesterday. The Council hopes that the Commission will soon submit the proposals officially so that it may begin to consider them and draw its conclusions. The European Parliament will, of course, be consulted in accordance with the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0063"></a>

<p>In crossing Western Sahara without the prior authorisation of the Western Saharan government, the organisers of the Paris-Dakar rally risked in an irresponsible and criminal way contributing towards bringing about a resumption of the fighting in a conflict which has still to be settled after 25 years. The event gave backing to the Moroccan Government which claims sovereignty over Western Sahara in defiance of international law. The cease-fire which has held since 1991 is now fragile. The situation could flare up at any moment and degenerate into war, destroying all the efforts made to achieve peace and harming the country's future for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Because they are similar in character, all of the questions relating to Western Sahara shall be answered at the same time.</p>
<p>The Council fully supports the United Nations Secretary-General and his personal envoy, James Baker, in their endeavour to find a solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. The parties are urged to continue their efforts, under James Baker’s supervision, to solve the countless problems in implementing the UN’s settlement plan effectively and to agree upon a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>All the parties have approved the principles behind the UN process. The Council is therefore convinced that this process constitutes the best framework for a lasting solution which would also strengthen the stability of the whole region. Every possible solution must be based upon full respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights.</p>
<p>The Council is willing to contribute actively to this process and help bring about a climate of trust and confidence between the parties concerned which can facilitate a settlement. In close consultation with James Baker and through contacts with the countries’ representatives in New York, the Council has, in this spirit, urgently called upon Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario to put a number of humanitarian principles into practice by returning prisoners of war and allowing visits from relatives. The Council has emphasised the importance attached by the EU to confidence-building measures, especially those based upon the latest report by the United Nations Secretary-General. As a result of these approaches, 201 prisoners of war were released, and there was a positive response regarding visits by relatives. We hope that the United Nations’ Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross will be able to arrange such visits.</p>
<p>The EU also addressed the question of Western Sahara at the first meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council in October and at the Association Committee’s meeting in Rabat on 6 February 2001.</p>
<p>Finally, I should like to emphasise that the European Union is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to refugees from Western Sahara. EUR 20 million was paid out through the Commission’s ECHO office between 1999 and 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0068"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member states, at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, the European Council emphasised that the transition to a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based economy was especially important and urged the Council and the Commission to draw up an action plan for eEurope in order to exploit this opportunity to the full. The action plan, drawn up by the Commission and the Council and adopted by the European Council at the Feira Summit in June 2000, includes measures for greater Internet safety and the development of a coordinated and uniform approach to Internet-related crime before the end of 2000.</p>
<p>The European Union has already adopted a series of measures to combat damaging and unlawful material on the Internet, to protect non-material copyright and personal data, to promote electronic commerce and the use of electronic signatures and to improve the security of transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently submitted a communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions under the heading of ‘A Safer Information Society – Safer Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime’.</p>
<p>The various alternative measures available to the EU for combating computer-related crime and referred to in this communication are based upon the study’s analysis and recommendations, the conclusions from the consultation process, the new opportunities offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the work that has been done within the EU, G8 and the Council of Europe (which is expected to complete its work by producing the Convention on Cyber-crime this year). At Community level, the solutions chosen ought not to mean that the internal market is impeded or fragmented, nor should they entail measures that undermine the protection of basic rights.</p>
<p>The House ought also to be reminded that, for a long time, the EU has supported projects aimed at promoting the safety of information infrastructures and electronic transactions and at increasing public confidence in these. Research projects and operational projects aimed at promoting the special training of staff in crime-fighting organisations, together with cooperation between crime-fighting organisations and industry, have also received support within the framework of the programmes within the third pillar; for example Stop, Falcone, Oisin and Grotius. The Swedish Presidency is arranging three seminars this year on these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0072"></a>

<p>Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) play a very important role in support of infrastructure projects in the South and in Eastern Europe. During the 1990’s, ECAs’ financing through loans, project guarantees and investment insurance averaged USD 80-100 billion per annum. Roughly 60% was channelled in support of energy-intensive projects: fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas development, transportation, etc. While a few – most notably the US Export-Import Bank – weight environmental impact in deciding whether to make loans, most do not. This means that taxpayers’ money is being used to subsidise investments in carbon-based technologies. Given the seriousness of the climate problem – and EU commitments to the Kyoto Protocol – it is remarkable that so little attention has been paid to the critical role played by ECAs.</p>

<p>According to a report which has been drawn up by Barcelona University as part of the ‘Farewell to Arms’ campaign (whose participants include Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Intermon and Médecins sans Frontières) and which concerns the criteria for granting or withholding authorisation in respect of arms exports, 42% of Spanish arms exports contravene the criteria laid down in the EU’s relevant code of practice. In particular, weapons are allegedly being sold to countries which violate human rights, which are involved in conflicts, which are subject to UN embargoes or sanctions or which resell weapons to third parties. These facts are serious ones which reveal the Union’s inconsistency in this area and undermine its international efforts to secure peace and protect human rights – and which are regarded by the author of this question as totally unacceptable. Is the Council aware of this situation? Is it intending to contact the authors of the report in order to seek their opinions? Will it demand an explanation from the Spanish Government regarding the above facts and, where appropriate, immediately adopt a policy which meets the strict criteria laid down in the code of practice?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union's position on arms exports is reflected in the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports adopted on 8 June 1998. According to the operative provisions of the Code, "each Member State will assess export licence applications for military equipment made to it on a case-by-case basis against the provisions of the Code of Conduct". Decisions on whether to grant an export licence are consequently taken by each Member State individually and it does not lie in the Council's purview to exercise any judgement on such individual decisions. The Code itself and the increased dialogue and exchange of information concerning national export policies are expected to contribute to a convergence of the arms exports policies and procedures of the European Union Member States. The annual assessment of the functioning of the Code which is reflected in the annual report is an important step in this process.</p>
<p>The second annual report which has been adopted by the Council and published in the Official Journal confirms that the Code has ushered in a new degree of transparency between governments in the area of arms export policies and has enabled the Member States to enter into dialogue when considering national arms licensing decisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0079"></a>

<p>The honourable Member is reminded that policy towards minority and regional languages is to be considered, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as falling primarily within the responsibility of Member States. However, the Council fully recognises the importance of the linguistic diversity of the EU, as exemplified by the Council's conclusions of 12 June 1995 on linguistic diversity and multilingualism in the European Union and, more recently, by the fact that the European Year of Languages 2001 (jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council) is aimed at the promotion of language learning in general, as is clear from article 1 of the Decision designating that event. The Council has, moreover, noted the Commission's call for proposals during 2000 for measures to promote and safeguard regional and minority languages and cultures (OJ C 266, 16.9.00, p. 15) and would also examine with interest any future proposals submitted by the Commission in this context.</p>

<p>1. The EU and the Member States are fully aware of the difficulties many poor countries, and in particular the least developed ones, face because of their excessive debt which affects their development prospects and undermines their political stability and progress towards democracy. The EC development cooperation places a special focus on the situation of the least developed and other low-income countries. In the joint declaration of the 10th of November 2000, the Council and the Commission confirms the overarching goal of EC development cooperation: the reduction – and eventual eradication – of poverty. This objective entails a determination to eliminate inequalities and support a gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy. In this context, the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC) is of outmost importance.</p>
<p>2. In order to alleviate the debt burden, the EU and the Member States have actively taken or participated in initiatives at various levels, in conformity with their competencies.</p>
<p>- On 6 July 1998, the Council decided to participate fully in the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) initiative launched by the IMF and the World Bank. This initiative was based on a commitment by the international financial community to reduce countries' debt burden to a sustainable level, provided that the country completes a period of strong economic policy performance.</p>
<p>- At the Cologne Summit in June 1999, Ministers agreed to an "enhanced HIPC initiative that will provide faster, deeper and broader debt relief".</p>
<p>- The European Council of Cologne in 1999 highlighted the importance "of finding a lasting solution to the debt problems of the poorest countries. The European Council welcomes the common European position on improving the debt initiative for heavily indebted poor countries and supports a faster debt reduction process for the poorest countries and ambitious aims as regards the extent of debt remission. It emphasises the debt relief should be more closely linked with a strategy for poverty alleviation. The Member States are prepared to support an increase in the remission percentage on commercial loans to 90% or more at the Paris Club and will seek to promote further reductions for debt from official development aid. Within this framework, with appropriate burden sharing, Europe is ready to bear its fair share of the cost of an improved debt initiative."</p>
<p>- At the annual World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington in September 1999, the donor community took an ambitious set of political decisions closely linking poverty alleviation strategies, structural adjustment programmes and the debt reduction initiative.</p>
<p>3. Following these decisions, the EU-ACP Joint Council decided, in December 1999, that unallocated programmable resources from the EDF might be used in the form of grants for meeting the outstanding debt and debt servicing obligations to the Community of the first ACP countries which qualify under the HIPC initiative (EUR 320 million), and for contributing to the overall financing of the HIPC initiative by providing up to EUR 680 million for the HIPC Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.</p>
<p> In July 2000, the EC disbursed the first tranche of the contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund amounting to EUR 250 million to the African Development Bank. In early September, the EU disbursed from its budget its contribution of EUR 54 million to the HIPC Trust Fund in favour of eligible Asian and Latin American HIPCs.</p>
<p> Similarly, a first payment of EUR 100 million was made at the end of 2000 to the Special Trust Fund established with the EIB to alleviate the burden of debt owed by the ACP HIPCs to the Community in the form of special loans and risk capital.</p>
<p> The mobilisation of the remainder of the up to EUR 1 billion contribution to the HIPC Initiative will depend on actual needs and contributions from other donors.</p>
<p> The EC stresses that debt relief is closely linked to the aim of poverty reduction: decisions and completion points of the enhanced HIPC initiative now depend on the definition of Poverty Reduction Strategy papers, to be elaborated and initiated by the beneficiary countries.</p>
<p>4. In the framework of the Africa-Europe Summit in Cairo, 3-4 April 2000, a number of Member States announced their willingness to write off most, if not all, debts of HIPC countries.</p>
<p> Additionally, at this summit, parties:</p>
<p>- agreed "to support African countries in channelling the amounts of resources from debt relief to poverty eradication strategies and programmes, including in social and infrastructural sectors."</p>
<p>- reaffirmed the commitment to achieve the globally agreed target of poverty reduction by half by the year 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0110"></a>

<p>The Council is aware of the permanent evolution of agricultural structures in the European Union following the implementation and subsequent Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in a competitive international environment and the rapid evolution of science and technology in a society more and more concerned about environment protection, food quality and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The decrease in employment in the agricultural sector in average terms is the natural consequence of this evolution and, to a certain extent, it represents a positive trend allowing a better use of the production capacity through sustainability of family farms following the European model of multi-functional agriculture. The Common Agricultural Policy until now was indeed capable of following this process in an orderly manner and of ensuring a reasonable comparability of average income from farming activity with other economic sectors. In many cases, the decrease in agricultural employment in primary agricultural activity was followed by an increase in employment in the area of transformation and processing of agricultural products.</p>
<p>With the recent adoption of Agenda 2000 reform, the Council has started to drive the traditional Common Agricultural Policy from organisation and protection of markets into a new rural development policy taking into consideration not only the traditional agricultural activity but also encouraging alternative economic activities in rural areas through facilitating investments for the maintenance and reinforcement of viable social fabric in rural areas, the development of economic activities and the maintenance and creation of employment with the aim of ensuring a better exploitation of existing inherent potential and the removal of inequalities and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women, in particular by supporting projects initiated and implemented by women.</p>
<p>Of course, setting up schemes to help young farmers, to support vocational training and to implement early retirement schemes also contributes to the turnover between generations and to the improvement of the occupational skills and competence of farmers and other persons involved in rural activities.</p>
<p>According to Regulation 1257/99, it is up to the national authorities to implement those measures and elaborate programmes and projects ensuring the cofinancing of such opportunities.</p>
<p>The Council pays great attention to the simplification of the application of the Common Agricultural Policy, in particular to making the administrative burden easier for farmers to get the FEOGA payments which represent a substantial share of their income. The Council is, at present, considering a proposal of the Commission for the modification of certain provisions of Regulation 1259/99 establishing the rules for direct support schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy on which the Parliament European has been consulted and which would introduce a simplified system for paying limited amounts of direct aid to small farmers for a trial period under necessary controls.</p>
<p>The Council is politically committed to conduct a mid-term review of Agenda 2000 by the year 2003, on the basis of Commission reports. It will, of course, devote all its attention to any new Commission proposal to increase employment in agriculture, or to promote increased agricultural incomes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0113"></a>

<p>It is thanks to the Community measures that have been put in place that more cases of BSE are being discovered. If Member States fully apply the ban on feeding of MBM to ruminants, the removal of SRMs and are vigilant in their surveillance programmes, then BSE can be brought under control in the EU.</p>
<p>The implementation of Community legislation on BSE by Member States is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission. This monitoring takes the form of on the spot inspections in the Member States involving examination of premises, facilities, protocols and records. In response to the developments in BSE in the latter part of 2000, this programme of inspections has been stepped up. A new series of missions to the Member States will start in March 2001 in order to verify the implementation of the legislation recently adopted by the Council and which came into force on 1 January 2001. In relation to matters of public and animal health, the Commission’s policy is to maintain a high level of vigilance in order to ensure that Member States fully comply with their obligations under Community law.</p>
<p>At the January 2001 Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting, the Commission presented a report on the implementation of BSE control measures in the Member States. This report made reference to the fact that some Member States are having to store material pending an increase in their rendering or incineration capacity and that other Member States have to export SRM to neighbouring States for processing.</p>
<p>In cases where the sudden increase in material for destruction has meant that existing processing facilities are insufficient to cope with the volume, it is reasonable and unavoidable that Member States should store processed and unprocessed material pending an increase in their capacity. Providing that this storage is under official control and is performed in a hygienic manner, there is no reason that it should pose a risk to health. Similarly, the export of high risk material to other Member States for incineration is provided for in Community legislation and is subject to strict monitoring by Member States of origin and of destination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0012"></a>

<p>The honourable Member raises the important issue of how public health and new technologies interact as regards in particular the expanding use of mobile telephones. Let me first say that over the past 20 years, there has been an important research effort under the leadership of the World Health Organisation’s electromagnetic fields project. The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection has also been involved in this project to look for evidence of adverse health effects from the exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>The Council Recommendation of 1999 on limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields is based on the guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, which were endorsed by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-Toxicity and the Environment. The Committee stated that these international guidelines provide the appropriate basis to develop exposure limits against public health risks.</p>
<p>Regarding long-term effects, the best available scientific knowledge does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that long-term effects occur as a consequence of exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, taking into account the growing public concern of long-term effects of such exposure and the rapid development of the telecommunications sector, the limits set up in the Council Recommendation include an additional safety factor of about 50 to the threshold values defined by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection for the general public. In this way, the Recommendation would cover possible long-term effects in the whole frequency range. As a result, the guidelines in the Council Recommendation provide protection thresholds with respect to adverse health effects which may be caused by exposure, taking into consideration the variety of possible physical characteristics and exposure scenarios.</p>
<p>In order to cover any new scientific findings and to ensure that the scientific basis, on which the Council Recommendation is based is still valid, the Scientific Steering Committee will give an up-dated opinion in June 2001.</p>
<p>To ensure a uniform level of protection throughout the European Union, the Commission has mandated the standardisation bodies (CENELEC and ETSI) to work on establishing European standards, including harmonised methods of calculation and measurement. This will enable verification that the safe exposure limits set in the Recommendation are met. A first standard for mobile telephones is expected to be available in June 2001, and other standards will follow.</p>
<p>Research efforts on electromagnetic fields and their effects continue at international level. Within the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development (Quality of Life programme, Key Action “Environment &amp; Health”), the European Commission funds EUR 9 million of research on the potential carcinogenic effects of radio frequencies. The Commission is supporting the largest study ever conducted on possible carcinogenic effects of electromagnetic fields. This study is coordinated by the International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC). Results are expected by 2004. This research is directly applicable to the protection of the public and will lead to strengthening the scientific basis for the establishment of exposure limit values.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0082"></a>

<p>The use of plant protection products in the Community is governed by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market. The Directive stipulates that the evaluation of the active substances should be done at Community level but that the specific evaluations and authorisations of products containing evaluated substances should be done by the Member States.</p>
<p>The active substances fipronil and imidacloprid were already on the market at the entry into force of the Directive and therefore they have to be re­evaluated at Community level. These active substances are included respectively in the second and third phase of the review programme for existing active substances. For both active substances industry has committed to submit a dossier in order to demonstrate that there are acceptable uses in accordance with Article 5 of the Directive. The Commission will report to Parliament and the Council next July on its progress with the re­evaluation programme.</p>
<p>Member States can only grant authorisations provided that the plant protection product, when properly used, does not have, inter alia, an unacceptable effect on the environment. As part of this assessment the impact on non­target insects, including honeybees, has to be evaluated. If necessary, appropriate risk mitigation measures such as use­restrictions need to be put in place.</p>
<p>For imidacloprid, the damage to bees resulting from use on sunflowers has not been proven but, since the currently available scientific evidence is not conclusive, the French authorities have suspended the use of imidacloprid on sunflowers.

<p>All over Europe, people are shocked by the pictures they see in the press and on television showing how animals are treated in the EU's industrial farming sector. Commissioner Byrne is on record as saying that he personally is disgusted by the way animals are being tortured, although he excused himself by saying that the EU does not have sufficient power to be able to do anything to about it. That is not true. The EU currently provides subsidies which result in the large-scale transport of animals. Does the Commission intend to take action to put an end to such subsidies?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The remarks attributed to the Member of the Commission concern the treatment of animals in a Community abattoir. No export refunds were payable in respect of these animals.</p>
<p>Animal welfare is an increasing social concern. Animal transport is the area that probably receives the widest public attention.</p>
<p>The Community has a key role to play in improving the conditions in which animals are reared, transported and slaughtered. The necessity to limit the transport of the animals over long distances only when it is really necessary, and to keep any suffering to a minimum, is an especially important objective.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted in December 2000 a specific report on the implementation of existing Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport. The report concludes that Member States have clear difficulties in fully applying Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport. It must be pointed out that national authorities did not give the necessary priority to this area of Community legislation during past years.</p>
<p>Rules on animal protection during transport are there to be respected, just like any other law. The Commission will not tolerate the shortcomings in implementation found in the Report.</p>
<p>Animal welfare and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport is a priority for the Commission and it should be the same for Member States. In this framework the Commission is studying possible solutions to replace the transport of live animals by the transport of meat.</p>
<p>Where necessary, it will put forward proposals before the end of this year to improve the legislation's requirements with the view to facilitate proper enforcement. The Commission is working on short-term proposals to improve different technical aspects of the Community legislation and to facilitate cooperation and coordination between national authorities involved in international transport as well as in controls at national level.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to actively check the enforcement of the Directive. Infringement proceedings have already been opened against some Member States in relation to their failure to implement Community legislation in this area. The Commission will be following future developments very closely and will quickly take appropriate follow up measures, including the opening of further infringement proceedings if no improvements are seen.</p>
<p>In relation to the payment of export refunds for live cattle from the Community, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98 which stipulates that the payment of export refunds is subject to compliance with Directive 91/628/EEC and provides for an appropriate monitoring system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is currently carrying out an inquiry in several Member States with regard to the implementation of Regulation 615/98. The level of export aid is calculated with great care and limited to what is strictly necessary. It should be mentioned that, during the last year, subsidies paid for cattle traded for slaughtering were reduced significantly from 60.50 euros/100 kg to 41.00 euros/100 kg.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0016"></a>

<p>The issue to which the honourable Member refers has also been the subject of several complaints to the Commission, most of which being very recent.</p>
<p>On the basis of the first complaint the Commission requested information from the British authorities by letter dated 10 October 2000 mainly concerning the existence of an intervention plan for the area of Gibraltar (Article 50 of Directive 96/29/Euratom), the measures taken to inform the public in the event of a radiological emergency relating to the repair operations of the submarine and the possible impact on Gibraltar and Spanish territory of the said operations.</p>
<p>The authorities of the United Kingdom answered by letters dated 14 November and 1 December 2000 that appropriate plans and information existed and the Commission has received a copy of the GIBPUBSAFE report. They furthermore confirmed that they are in regular contact with the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>Although the reply can be considered to be satisfactory, it appears that further clarification is needed in order to complete the information already received by the Commission. In addition, new issues raised by recent complaints will be addressed to the Authorities of the United Kingdom very soon. Those include a request to the United Kingdom to give details of the current and planned radiological monitoring.

<p>Until now, the membership of a given organisation has never been a precondition for its participation to calls for proposals: no thresholds were ever set, and proposals have always been assessed on a case by case basis and in function of their intrinsic quality and interest, i.e. their capacity to reach the targeted audience and have the best impact within the limits of each individual proposal.

<p>The Community has adopted over the last decade a number of measures relating to the safety of passenger vessels and of their passengers. The issue of disabled passengers has been specifically raised in the context of two of these instruments in terms which are in line with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) recommendation referred to by the honourable Member</p>
<p>Council Directive 1999/35/EC<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services contains an obligation for the operating companies "to ensure that general information about the services and assistance available to elderly and disabled persons on board is made known to the passengers and is made available in formats suitable for people with impaired sight". Furthermore, it requires Member States authorities to control documented evidence of safety training for personnel providing safety assistance to passengers, and in particular to elderly and disabled persons in an emergency.</p>
<p>Directive 1998/41/EC<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, making mandatory the registration of persons on board passenger ships, provides for the voluntary registration of information concerning the need for special care or assistance in emergency situations. Such information has to be communicated to the master before the departure of the ship.</p>
<p>Commenting on the facts reported by the honourable Member, the Commission wishes to underline that such practices go against the specific provisions of Directives 1998/18/EC<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span> and 1999/35/EC. Directive 1998/18/EC (introducing safety rules and standards for passenger ships) requires that the master, or the designated officer, shall ensure that, without the expressed consent of the master or the designated officer, no passengers are allowed access to an enclosed ro-ro deck when the ship is underway. Directive 1999/35/EC stipulates that the vehicle deck should be vacated by passengers before the ship sails and that they do not again have access until immediately prior to docking. On basis of the above, the Commission is, of course, ready to take appropriate action if formal complains were notified.</p>
<p>It is clear that while the above Directives deal with the safety of disabled people on board vessels, they do not address accessibility. However, following its recent Communication "Towards a barrier free Europe for people with disabilities", the Commission has undertaken the task to further examine issues relating to accessibility of disabled people to the means of transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member is informed that on 22<span class="sup">nd</span> January 2001, the General Affairs Council agreed a revised version of the Union Common Position on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Among other issues, this Common Position sets out the importance that the Union attaches ‘to respect for international Law and human rights, including the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women’, denounces continuing discrimination against women in Afghanistan being ‘.. particularly concerned that this discrimination is hampering the humanitarian efforts of the international organisations and NGOs.’ The Common Position further notes in Article 1(c) that one of its objectives in Afghanistan is ‘to promote respect for international humanitarian law and human rights, including the rights of women and children’. Article 3(b) of the Common Position states that the Union ‘shall urge Afghan factions to end discriminatory policies and recognise, protect and promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women, including access to education and health facilities, employment, personal security and freedom from intimidation and harassment, and will emphasise the negative implications of discriminatory policies for the effective supply of aid’.</p>
<p>The honourable Member has asked for population figures, but she will appreciate that accurate figures with regard to populations inside Afghanistan are extremely difficult to come by. Estimates of the overall population used by international aid agencies and non governmental organisations (NGOs) working in Afghanistan vary from 20 to 25 million. If it is assumed that approximately half of this number is made up of women and girls and that approximately 90% live in Taliban controlled areas, then the number of women and girls in these areas would be between 9 and 11.25 million.</p>
<p>It should be noted that inside Afghanistan, NGOs implementing Community funded projects currently have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical related programmes, in spite of the fact that separation between the two genders has to be strictly observed.</p>
<p>Taliban decrees prohibiting women from working have had differing effects depending upon the areas of activity and the geographical areas: Medical and food projects continue to employ women. After negotiations between the authorities and the concerned partners, Community funded Food for Work programmes have been able to restart after interruption.</p>
<p>With regard to appeals to neighbouring states, the Commission acts together with the Member States in matters concerning declarations, appeals or requests to third countries. On the occasion of the Union-Pakistan ad hoc political dialogue in Islamabad on 22/23 November 2000, the Union side urged Pakistan to reopen its borders to refugees from Afghanistan. More recently, on 17 January 2001, the Union issued a statement urging the Tajik authorities ‘to do everything in their power to alleviate the humanitarian situation of the refugees, in close cooperation with competent international bodies like UNHCR’.</p>
<p>Additionally, article 1(g) of the Common Position states that it is an objective of the Union ‘to support the programmes of international organisations and NGOs for Afghan refugee populations in neighbouring countries’. The honourable Member is informed that at the end of 2000, the Commission committed EUR 9 million in aid to uprooted people in Iran and Pakistan and that it is currently preparing a commitment to finance relief operations for refugees in Pakistan which will focus on the provision of drinking water and sanitation.</p>
<p>It can also be confirmed that the European Union is willing to consider assisting the Tajik authorities, both bilaterally and through ECHO, in the light of assessments and any subsequent appeals for assistance from international agencies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0034"></a>

<p>The question put to the Commission concerns the application of the Community competition rules to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals.</p>
<p>First of all, it has to be noted that Community competition law is applicable if there is an appreciable effect on trade between Member States. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, an agreement between undertakings or an abuse of a dominant position affects trade between Member States when it is capable of influencing, either directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, the pattern of trade between Member States.</p>
<p>The situation described in the question does not give indications as to the applicability of Community competition law, but seems to fall rather into the scope of application of the national competition rules.</p>
<p>It might, nevertheless, be useful to indicate that the Court of Justice has ruled in the Binon judgement<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> in 1985</p>
<p>- that a system of selective distribution may be established for the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, without infringing the prohibition contained in Article 85(1) [now Article 81(1)], given the special nature of those products as regards their distribution (they can only be sold by retailers during an extremely limited period of time, the publishers undertake to take back unsold copies),</p>
<p>- but that the permissibility of such a system depends in particular on the criteria governing the choice of distributors. Those criteria must be objective and of a qualitative nature. They must be laid down uniformly for all re-sellers and must not be applied in a discriminatory fashion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The use of extensive farming methods for meat production in the Community and the encouragement thereof under the CAP vary considerably from one sector to another, depending on the structure and content of the respective COMs.</p>
<p>In the case of beef and veal, specific measures exist in the context of the premiums offered to producers with a view to encouraging them to shift to more extensive forms of farming.</p>
<p>The breeding premiums are limited on the basis of the fodder capacity of each holding in relation to the number and species of livestock qualifying for a premium. Granting of the premiums (special premium and suckler cow premium) is subject to compliance with a maximum density factor of two adult bovine units (ABUs) per hectare and per calendar year.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to consolidate incentives to the extensification of production with a view to improving their effectiveness vis-à-vis the environmental objectives, a supplementary amount is granted to producers benefiting from the special premium and/or the suckler cow premium who comply with certain genuine, rigorous, requirements concerning the density factor.</p>
<p>Agenda 2000 has greatly reinforced this measure by almost trebling the amount of aid and limiting the areas to be considered to open fields only, while also taking account of all the livestock present on a farm.</p>
<p>This extensification payment is, in principle, EUR 100 per special premium and suckler cow premium granted, provided the density factor of the holding is equal to or less than 1.4 ABU per hectare for the calendar year concerned. Member States may decide to phase this measure in, choosing from a number of differentiated arrangements.</p>
<p>In the case of sheepmeat, it is well known that this form of production relies almost exclusively on extensive farming methods. The measures applied under the COM in sheepmeat accordingly support this form of production.</p>
<p>The COM in pigmeat does not include any support instrument addressed directly to pigmeat producers. It is therefore difficult to influence their choice of farming methods under the CAP. However, in response to consumer and retailer demand, certain producers have, in the last few years, converted to extensive methods. It is very possible that more producers will be encouraged to follow this example by the current debate on food safety and animal welfare.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission draws the honourable Member's attention to the linkage established between direct support payments to producers and environmental requirements with the Agenda 2000 CAP reform. Member States are now required to take the measures which they consider appropriate in view of the situation of the agricultural land use or the production concerned and which reflect the potential environmental effects. Member States have a number of options insofar as the measures are concerned, including agri-environment commitments, respect for general environmental requirements and specific environmental requirements constituting a condition for direct payments. This measure, the details of the application of which are currently being discussed, has great potential, if well implemented by Member States, to contribute to environmental improvement and sustainable development in agriculture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0039"></a>

The strategy is much wider as it also encompasses social and economic dimensions and as it takes a clearly longer term view, that of one generation ahead. Cardiff pursues a key instrument of sustainable development, namely the integration of environmental concerns into the decisions of other sectoral Council formations, but a successful strategy needs to rely on a wider array of tools, such as market reform and an active technology policy. Many of the themes in the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Environmental Action Programme will come back in the European Union strategy, though by no means all.

<p>The implementation of the directives has already had significant effects: insurers' international activities have increased, and competition on national markets has been boosted, in terms both of prices and of new products offered on the national markets.

<p>In crossing Western Sahara without the prior authorisation of the Western Saharan government, the organisers of the Paris-Dakar rally risked in an irresponsible and criminal way contributing towards bringing about a resumption of the fighting in a conflict which has still to be settled after 25 years. The event gave backing to the Moroccan Government which claims sovereignty over Western Sahara in defiance of international law. The cease-fire which has held since 1991 is now fragile.

<p>This year's Paris-Dakar Rally once again passed through territory occupied in breach of international law. In so doing, a driver was seriously injured by a landmine, aggravating the already tense situation in that region. The Polisario liberation movement put its soldiers on a state of alert after Moroccan army units had crossed the embankment along a five-kilometre section where the rally went through. What action does the Commission intend to take in order to counter the acute danger of war, maintain the cease-fire and contribute to a lasting peace settlement?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is following closely the progress being made in implementing the plan for settling the Western Sahara dispute, adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Like the Member States, the Commission fully supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Mr James Baker, to find a fair, lasting, and sustainable solution for Western Sahara. The Union is in close contact with Mr Baker to whom it has been expressed readiness to assist in concrete terms the different stages of the implementation of the plan of the United Nations, from the identification of voters to the repatriation of refugees and the rehabilitation of the territory.</p>
<p>At the occasion of his recent visit to the Maghreb countries, the President of the Commission stressed the importance of strengthened dialogue within the Arab Maghreb Union. It is hoped that direct talks between the interest parties in an open dialogue will lead out of the current deadlock.</p>
<p>As to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, the existing agreement has expired and the Commission is in the process of negotiating a new agreement. In the expired agreement, as in the ongoing negotiations, the Commission has been referring to the fishing zone of Morocco being defined by the "water falling within sovereignty and/or within the jurisdiction of Morocco". This definition does not prejudge in any way the statute of the waters in the Saharan fishing bank. The latter is governed by international law, and in particular the various United Nations' resolutions, to which the Union constantly brought its support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission supports the establishment of the South East Europe University (SEEU) in FYROM as an important step in providing for the educational rights of the Albanian minority there.</p>
<p>The Commission is prepared to propose a total contribution of EUR 5 million for the SEEU. A sum of EUR 1 million has already been committed under the 2000 budget through a Commission Decision of 17 November. The procedures are now underway to facilitate payment of this amount to the University by May. The Commission will propose that a further EUR 4 million be committed under the 2001 budget. These funds should be transferred to the University before the second half of this year.</p>
<p>The Community commitment to the SEEU is seen as a necessary guarantee for smaller donors contemplating participation in the project and an important factor contributing towards a successful outcome. The Commission understands that the total amount which has been pledged so far does not fully cover the needs. However, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has not signalled that this would hinder the initiative from getting off the ground.</p>
<p>The Commission is supporting the initiative precisely for the reasons of its significance in terms of ethnic reconciliation between the populations in the country.</p>
<p>The Commission is not in a position to fully finance the SEEU. This would imply using up the bulk of funding available for FYROM for this project. In addition to having to address other needs, not least the implementation of obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, such an unbalanced allocation of funds would not be acceptable to the national authorities: it could even heighten ethnic tensions rather then soothe them.</p>
<p>It is important to refer from now on to the South East Europe (SEE) University rather than to the Tetovo University since the latter term refers to the existing unrecognised University. Given the sensitivity of the issue, we should not burden this new initiative with the heritage of that University.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0071"></a>

<p>Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) play a very important role in support of infrastructure projects in the South and in Eastern Europe. During the 1990’s, ECAs’ financing through loans, project guarantees and investment insurance averaged USD 80-100 billion per annum. Roughly 60% was channelled in support of energy-intensive projects: fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas developments, transportation, etc. While a few – most notably the US Export-Import Bank – weight environmental impact in deciding whether to make loans, most do not. This means that taxpayers money is being used to subsidise investments in carbon-based technologies. Given the seriousness of the climate problem – and EU commitments to the Kyoto Protocol – it is remarkable that so little attention has been paid to the critical role played by ECAs.</p>

<p>The Community acquis on food safety contains detailed provisions on the safety requirements (hygiene, additives, flavourings, etc.) and on labelling of foodstuffs. Any new Member State has to be in a position to apply fully the Community acquis by the date of accession. This is why all candidate countries are encouraged to apply the food safety legislation well before accession so as to offer the possibility to both the administrative structures and the food operators to adapt gradually to the Community system. This is to ensure that the internal market functions properly from the date of accession and that consumers are protected and correctly informed throughout the enlarged Community.</p>
<p>The Community acquis on food also includes a quality policy, i.e. provisions on specific products, for which there is a possibility of seeking protection for geographical names and traditional methods against misuse, misleading use and imitation. If candidate countries wish to seek such protection by accession, they have to make a formal request to the Commission, which will be examined in detail.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any request for derogation of the product Utopenec from the Community acquis and does not know whether the Czech Republic intends to seek protection of this product under the Community rules on quality policy.</p>
<p>As regards slivovitz, Council Regulation (EEC) N° 1576/89 lays down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks. At present the production method of slivovitz appears not to comply with the requirements laid down by this Regulation for the category “fruit spirits”.

<p>The findings of the committee of inquiry into the Greek general elections (9 April 2000) revealed that thousands of people who were not entitled to Greek nationality had become illegally naturalised and that a large number of irregularities had occurred in this connection. Five thousand cases of such illegal activity have already been discovered at the Moscow Consulate involving officials working for the diplomatic service. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered an official inquiry into the ‘Greek naturalisation industry’, which had been in operation since 1993. Despite the fact that the acquisition and loss of nationality is the sole responsibility of the Member States, in view of the fact that the Greek Government is seeking the deletion of references to nationality from identity papers contrary to Directives 68/360/EEC<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 73/148/EEC<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which specifically require the nationality to be indicated.</p>

<p>There are two parts to the honourable Member’s question, the first relating to the failure to specify nationality in the new Greek identity papers and the second to possible irregularities committed in attributing Greek nationality to certain persons.</p>
<p>As regards the first aspect, the Commission must inform you that it has, in a letter of 4 December 2000, already drawn the attention of the Greek Government to the fact that the deletion of references to nationality in Greek identity papers may be in contravention of Community law, particularly of the two directives to which the honourable Member refers, and may constitute an obstacle to the free movement of Greek citizens on Member State territory. Article 2(2) of Council Directives 68/360/EEC, of 15 October 1968, on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families, and 73/148/EEC, of 21 May 1973, on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to the establishment and provision of services, stipulate that “Member States shall, acting in accordance with their laws, issue to their nationals, or renew, an identity card or passport, which shall state in particular the holder's nationality.” This is also applicable to other classes of citizen within the European Union, particularly to citizens other than workers, insofar as Directives 90/364, 90/365 and 93/96 refer to the aforementioned directives.</p>
<p>The Greek Government replied in a letter of 18 January 2001. Their answer specified that Greek identity papers have Hellenic Republic in the header and are, moreover, issued exclusively to Greek nationals. The holder of Greek identity papers must necessarily, therefore, have Greek nationality without the need to specify this. The Greek Government acknowledged, nonetheless, that the matter of the deletion of references to nationality in the new Greek identity papers is currently being examined in the greatest detail in anticipation of a ruling pending in a case before the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission is thus unable to declare an opinion until the Greek Authorities have adopted a definitive position.</p>
<p>On the second aspect, it should be noted that, as the honourable Member points out, the granting of nationality of a Member State is a matter of national jurisdiction (see Declaration 2 on nationality of a Member State, annexed to the Final Act of the Conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States establishing the Treaty on European Union, OJ 1992, C 191, page 98). Nonetheless, exercise of this jurisdiction must comply with Community law (see: Judgement of the Court of Justice of 7 July 1992 in case C-369/90, Micheletti, European Court Reports 1992 page I-4239, item 10: “Under international law, it is for each Member State, having due regard to Community law, to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality.”)</p>
<p>In view of the above, the European Union is not authorised to proceed to harmonise national legislative texts on the granting of nationality. Furthermore, the European Commission may not act in place of the competent national administrative and judicial authorities and declare an opinion on any possible irregularities committed in the granting of Greek nationality to certain persons.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that persons holding valid Greek identity papers or passports will have no problem in travelling and residing freely within the territory of EU Member States. For reasons of legal security, it is commonly accepted that the holder of a valid travel document may exercise all the rights arising from possession of such a document until it is cancelled, withdrawn or until it expires.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is in the process of carrying out a full economic analysis of environmental liability. Following the publication in 1993 of its Green Paper on Remedying Environmental Damage and in preparation for its White Paper on Environmental Liability, the Commission in 1996 published a study entitled "Economic Aspects of Liability and Joint Compensation Systems for Remedying Environmental Damage". Fulfilling the commitment it made in the White Paper to study in more depth the economic issues involved in liability, the Commission launched seven new studies: four on financial insurance issues, one focused on industry competitiveness issues, one on the impact of the proposals on prevention of damage and one on the valuation and restoration of biodiversity damage. In addition, the Commission has also commissioned an update of the legal study which was carried out in 1996. The results of all of these new studies will be published on the Commission WebPages dedicated to environmental liability<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>.

<p>There is no doubt that recreational angling is a widespread spare time activity all over Europe: in certain areas it is also an important factor of the local economy, mainly of the tourist industry.

<p>The European Angler’s Alliance (EAA) has contacted the Commission and a meeting was held in November 2000. It was agreed that the EAA would be informed about the Work Programme of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, in order to allow closer involvement of recreational anglers in discussion within that Committee of matters of special interest to them, or on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>As far as the proposed study mentioned in the honourable Member’s question is concerned, the Commission is unable to support any additional studies in the current planning period due to priorities imposed by the need for research on other aspects of fisheries management and also due to budgetary constraints.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0096"></a>

<p>The Commission has received complaints on this issue and is currently examining the Danish measure in the light of the principle set forth in Articles 28 to 30 (ex Articles 30-36) of the EC Treaty, prohibiting unjustified trade barriers, and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. The Court has stated that a national price regulation could be contrary to the principle of free movement of goods when certain conditions are fulfilled. At this stage the Commission is awaiting supplementary information to be supplied by the complainants illustrating the effects of the Danish measure before taking any further steps. When the Commission has examined this information in the light of Articles 28 to 30 of the EC Treaty it will decide on whether the Danish measure constitutes an infringement of Community law.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of remedies, the Court of Justice has pronounced itself in its jurisprudence (joined cases C-46/93 and C-48/93 “Brasserie du Pêcheur”). It has stated that in the event of a breach of Community law, the principle whereby a State is liable for loss and damage caused to individuals is inherent in the system of the Treaty. Therefore, when a breach of Community law by a Member State is attributable to the national legislature acting in a field in which it has a wide discretion to make legislative choices, individuals suffering loss or injury thereby are entitled to reparation where the rule of Community law breached is intended to confer rights upon them, the breach is sufficiently serious and there is a direct causal link between the breach and the damage sustained by the individuals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0097"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the extent of the disaster which has struck Portugal and the extent of the damage inflicted. It offers its condolences to the families of the victims and its deepest sympathy to all those persons affected by these terrible floods.</p>
<p>The Commission has several times had occasion to outline the resources available to it in order to contribute towards offsetting the effects of natural disasters by means of existing financial instruments. There is indeed some margin for action within the Structural Fund programmes. As the Commissioner responsible for regional policy announced in the plenary sitting in Brussels on 31 January 2001, the Commission proposes, in close liaison with the Portuguese Government and the local authorities, to look into the possibilities for reallocating resources from the Structural Fund programmes which have already been approved for the period 2000-2006 in order to assist the affected areas.</p>
<p>The Commission would point out that the budget line for the allocation of emergency aid to victims of disasters within the Community ceased to exist in 1998. The question of reintroducing a specific budget line was raised in the course of the budgetary procedure for 2001 but was not retained in the budget adopted. At the present time, therefore, there is no budget framework for Community emergency aid to the flood victims in Portugal.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Nice redefines Article 100 TEC and specifies that the decision is taken by qualified majority. The article does not specify conditions for the granting of Community financial assistance. Nonetheless, a Declaration which will be appended to the Treaty of Nice stipulates that such assistance must comply with the financial perspectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0100"></a>

<p>During the 1990s, the economic situation for people in the world's least developed countries scarcely improved. High customs duties and other barriers to trade were amongst the reasons for this. The UN has calculated that developing countries as a whole would stand to earn 100-150 bn dollars a year if all existing trade barriers were removed. The Commission proposal to remove EU customs duties on everything but arms for the world's 48 poorest countries is therefore a small step in the right direction. According to reports in the Swedish press, however, it appears that the Commission is considering keeping customs duties on agricultural products. That is alarming, as poor countries' exports are concentrated in the sphere of labour-intensive products, especially agricultural produce. It should be borne in mind that, at present, the highest EU duties are precisely on agricultural products and also that nearly half the EU budget is spent on subsidising farming in the European Union.</p>

In summer 2000, the Swedish Market Court issued a ruling concerning a TV advertisement for 'Warm Oat Crunch' flakes produced by Quaker Oats. The advertisement took the form of a serial, but the Market Court considered that it was not targeted specifically at children, the reason being that the product can be used both by adults and by children. The ruling thus focused mainly on the product rather than on the advertisement itself.

<p>The Television without frontiers (TVWF) Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council) provides the legal framework for television broadcasting within the Community.</p>
<p>The TVWF Directive, as adopted in 1989, contained certain provisions relating to television advertising. In particular, Article 16 lays down certain principles relating to advertising and children. It states that television advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors and sets out certain criteria to achieve that aim. These criteria are that advertising:</p>
<p>Shall not directly exhort minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity;</p>
<p>Shall not directly encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or services being advertised;</p>
<p>Shall not unreasonably show minors in dangerous situations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these provisions apply to all advertising, and not simply to advertising intended for minors. The Commission has no reason at this stage to consider that the approach of the Directive on this issue needs to be modified.</p>
<p>When the directive was reviewed, the Commission undertook to carry out a study on the impact of television advertising and teleshopping on minors, in the context of the next review of the Television Directive, in accordance with Article 26 thereof. This study should be completed shortly. A Commission Communication on the study will be transmitted to the Parliament and the Council following the finalisation of the study.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the ruling in the British High Court that plant pots are to be considered as packaging according to the national legislation in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, the Commission can neither interfere with the ruling of the High Court, nor provide a definitive interpretation of the Community legislation. The definition of packaging, as stated in Directive 94/62/EC<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on packaging and packaging waste, may only be determined ultimately by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that the definition of packaging as stated in Council Directive 94/62/EC has proven difficult to interpret in certain specific cases, such as flower pots, and that differing interpretations of the concept of packaging could lead to market distortion. For that reason, the Commission has been working on the issue, inter alia, with experts of Member States.</p>
<p>It seems that a consensus has emerged from these discussions that it could be useful to complement the current definition by annexing technical guidance to the Directive. This technical guidance might be based on the results of exchange of opinions conducted within the framework of a structured dialogue between all the different stakeholders of the packaging chain – Member States, industry, environmental non governmental organisations (NGOs) and consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The possibility that a new European chemicals policy might require a large programme of testing on animals is a cause of grave concern to very many people in Europe.</p>
<p>The current system requires that a standard set of tests is completed before any safety assessment is carried out, and lacks a clear strategy for minimising animal testing. Would the Commission agree that a new system is required that is based on a step-wise approach, so that tests for properties with the most significant risk management implications are conducted first, avoiding inconsequential animal testing? Furthermore, would it not agree that before any additional animal tests are considered, full use should be made of all existing information, including evidence of safety-in-use (which may cover many years of use by the public), structure-activity analysis and other non-animal test methods and that wherever appropriate, the precautionary principle should be rigorously applied?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is indeed considering the issue of the safety of chemical substances. It is particularly concerned that the majority of the chemical substances now on the Community market were first marketed before 1981, when the requirement for fuller information on toxicological and ecotoxicological properties was introduced for new chemicals. Therefore, the market is dominated by substances for which there is no or insufficient data to demonstrate their safety. This situation should be improved, as serious damage to human health has already occurred in the case of asbestos where workers were exposed.</p>
<p>Against this background, it is necessary to consider how to improve the protection of human health and the environment. In so doing, the Commission will balance the need for more information against its commitment to limit animal testing. Where appropriate, the necessary test programme would have to be minimised by promoting use of the approaches proposed by the honourable Member. Furthermore, test requirements may be reduced for substances neither used by the general population nor released into the environment. The precautionary principle will, of course, be applied as appropriate.</p>
<p>The use of animals in the resulting test programme should be minimised through use of existing alternative testing methods and continuing development of new alternative methods. The Commission is committed to the objective of refinement, reduction and replacement of animal testings as is shown in its research programmes, in particular the Quality of Life Programme, and in the activities carried out by the Joint Research Centre, specifically at the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods which validates alternative methods. This is supported by Community legislation requiring that, where equivalent methods exist, using the minimum number of animals shall be chosen. The forthcoming White Paper on chemical strategy will also reflect this priority.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will see that the Commission is seeking to balance animal welfare considerations against the potentially serious threats to human health and the environment, including wild animals, presented by insufficiently tested chemicals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0107"></a>

<p>The Commission has two sources of information on what Member States are doing to improve the opportunities for older workers in work places and labour markets: (1) occasional studies and (2) the ongoing monitoring of National Action Plans as part of the employment process. </p>
<p>(1) A recent comprehensive overview of measures taken by individual Member States was produced by the Employment Observatory and published as Trends No. 33 "Older Workers on the Labour Market" in 1999.</p>
<p>(2) In the European employment strategy, attention to older workers' issues has increased considerably over the last 2 years. From a simple mention in the 1999 employment guidelines, older workers issues have been upgraded to a special guideline (no. 3) on active ageing in 2001. At the same time a number of other guidelines are of relevance for the improvement of conditions for older workers (e.g. 4-6 life long learning; 8 anti-discrimination; 14 flexible working time etc.).</p>
<p>In its employment recommendations the Commission and the Council have paid considerable attention to older workers issues both in 2000 and in 2001. It was suggested to 8 Member States in 2000 and to 9 of them in 2001 that they ought to intensify their efforts to enhance the capacity and incentives for older workers to remain in the labour market.</p>
<p>The "Joint Employment Report" assesses each year progress achieved by Member States in implementing the Guidelines. The 2000 Joint Report recognised that: "Most Member States have started to implement or are planning to introduce soon measures encouraging older people to stay longer in employment, by raising the retirement age or by introducing or strengthening disincentives to early retirement. The most comprehensive reforms are being undertaken or envisaged in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland."<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span></p>
<p>At the same time there is room for improvement in the policy attention to older workers’ issues in several Member States. The Commission therefore intends to continue to monitor developments closely and to work with Member States to help them improve the abilities and motivations of older workers to remain in the employed labour force.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last decade a favourable economic outlook for the Union has been created as a result of a sound macroeconomic framework combined with a real commitment to reform of labour, capital, goods and service markets. However, in a world that does not stand still, progress towards meeting the objectives made at the Lisbon European Council needs to be based on strong commitment to concerted action across different policy domains.</p>
<p>The Lisbon objective requires action both by the Community and the Member States. The combination of policies which is required is a broad one: sound macroeconomic policy; structural reforms which promote adaptable labour markets, increased innovation and higher competitiveness; active policies promoting the development of human resources, lifelong learning, inclusion and solidarity. The Luxembourg process through which the Employment Guidelines are coordinated contributes to ensuring that a strategic and coordinated approach is pursued, and several of the individual Guidelines are specifically aimed at young people and the long-term unemployed.</p>
<p>Along the road to meeting the Lisbon objective, certain themes are of particular importance. First, taking account of job quality while increasing employment rates. Second, providing life-long learning which enhances the capacity of people to participation in the knowledge-based society. Third, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders play their part: from governments, to Social Partners, and Regional and Local actors. Fourth, taking care that different policy actions are consistent and complementary. Last, establishing methods for measuring actions and progress. In each of these areas, care is being taken to ensure that the interests of young people and the long-term unemployed are being taken into account. In particular, it should be noted that the newly established Social Inclusion process promises to further enhance this positive situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0111"></a>

<p>The Lisbon European Council recognised that the number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion in the Community is unacceptable and that efforts are needed to make a significant impact on the eradication of poverty and exclusion in the next 10 years. Homelessness, including other forms of precarious housing, is an important dimension of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the fight against social exclusion in the Community, the Lisbon European Council also agreed for the Member States to work together through an open method of coordination, combining national action plans on how Member States are fighting social exclusion and a Community Programme (to facilitate policy-oriented cooperation in this field between Member States). The aim of the national action plans and the Programme is to make it possible to achieve the common objectives against poverty and social exclusion which were adopted last December by the Nice European Council. Among these objectives, several are particularly relevant for tackling homelessness.</p>
<p>The National action plans will be submitted by June 2001 for the period 2001-2003. They should include concrete initiatives aimed at tackling and preventing homelessness. The Council and the Commission will subsequently adopt a joint report by the end of 2001 presenting the conclusion of the examination of the plans.</p>
<p>The Community programme, which should support transnational cooperation activities, is currently discussed in Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure. The Swedish Presidency of the Council has expressed hopes for the Programme to be adopted in the summer of this year. The start of the programme does, of course, depend on the date of adoption by the Council and the Parliament but is most likely to be 1 January 2002. Policy cooperation initiatives on homelessness issues that arise as a (common) priority in the National action plans would be eligible for funding under the programme.</p>
<p>The proposed Programme includes a provision to support networking at European level of organisations involved with the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The Commission is currently supporting the FEANTSA network which focuses on fighting homelessness and will endeavour to do so until the start of the programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0114"></a>

There are also various international agreements concerning accidents, safety and transport in the sphere of the transportation of nuclear material.</p>
<p>In the case of maritime shipment, the containers used to transport spent nuclear fuel have been designed to be totally resistant in the event of immersion, even at great depths. In the present case, the only potential problem concerns adaptation of the specifications of the transporting vessels – which have to operate in Arctic waters – to International Maritime Organisation standards. Only that organisation has the authority to issue binding guidelines on the matter.</p>
<p>The fact that the transport of radioactive waste between Europe and Japan is carried out by sea, across the Arctic Ocean and close to the coastline of the Russian Federation, is not in itself grounds for taking preventive action, unless it is found that this transport is infringing IMO rules.</p>
<p>There is no legal instrument which would enable the Commission to restrict the use of Arctic waters for transportation of radioactive waste produced by the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0116"></a>

<p>The honourable Member is correct in stating that Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development shall apply as of 1 January 2000.</p>
<p>This date marks the point where projects become eligible to receive aid under the ‘rural development’ operational programme submitted by Greece in April 2000 and which also includes measures in favour of young farmers.</p>
<p>However, Member States are very often reluctant to implement programmes until they are sure of the Commission’s approval and indeed, this programme has not yet been approved by the Commission.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this delay, which the Commission is well aware of, is the operational status of the new management authorities required following the reform of the Structural Funds. In liaison with the Greek Authorities, the Commission has drawn up a methodology and a timetable for the implementation of these management authorities, which should have been allocated sufficient personnel and which should be fully operational within the first two months of 2001. This would make it possible for the programme to be officially adopted in March and subsequently for measures to be implemented from that time on. The Greek Government has just informed the Commission that the management authority responsible for the Rural Development programme shall be operational by the end of February 2001. This programme should therefore be approved shortly by the Commission.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that Commission Regulation No 2075/2000, amending Regulation No 1750/1999, stipulates that, as regards applications for aid made by young farmers for the first time in 2000, one of the criteria – the requirement of being under 40 years of age – must be fulfilled at the time of presenting the application and not at the time that a decision is made to grant aid in that specific case. This interim provision will make it possible to partly offset the effects of the above delay affecting young farmers who submitted an application for aid before first setting up business during that year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission appreciates the support the honourable Members and many other Members have expressed for the Commission’s new policy on Malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB in the context of poverty reduction. The deaths of 5 million people per year, most of them in developing countries, from these three communicable diseases represent a global emergency against which the Commission with the Member States and its international partners should take coherent and concerted action. Although priority must be given to the preventive efforts, increased support for the development and availability of new vaccines for AIDS and malaria will be an integral part of the efforts.</p>
<p>The Commission has prepared a “Programme for Action” to implement the new Community policy on the three major communicable diseases over the coming 5 years (2001-2006) which will be sent to Parliament and Council. It is hoped that Parliament will support the Programme for Action which identifies a substantial number of actions in support of the development and availability of AIDS and malaria vaccines including support to networks for the testing of vaccines, such as the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network.</p>
<p>The Programme for Action (2001-2006) will be financed through the Community’s existing financial instruments such as the European Development Fund (EDF) and geographical budget lines. Where appropriate, this may include the use of dedicated thematic budget lines such as budget line B7-6213 (previous B7-6211 and B7-6212). In addition, a Communication on additional Community investment in research concerning communicable diseases in developing countries, including malaria vaccines, will be presented by the end of 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0119"></a>

The reason seems to be that, because they are more cost-effective, e-tailers can keep their prices lower, which gives them a competitive edge over their suppliers' other customers. Consumers are the main losers as a result of such discrimination against e-tailers, since e-tailing enables consumers who live in areas far from big cities and specialist shops to buy goods to which they previously did not have access. They may no longer be able to get hold of the goods they want at all if e-tailing is not given the conditions it needs to survive.</p>

<p>In the past the provision of airport capacity has been organised largely as a non-market activity. In that context the Commission has always considered the construction and development of airport infrastructure as being a measure of general policy which cannot be controlled by the Commission under the EC Treaty rules on State aid.<a href="#defann_77_1" name="refann_77_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span></p>
<p>However, the airport industry has been going through a process of deep transformation for the last years. In the increasingly liberal and competitive environment of air transport, airport operations have also been changing in nature and have been evolving from government branches towards commercial undertakings. A major feature in this evolution is the emerging of a certain degree of competition between airports. This evolution is reflected in a recent judgement of the Court of First Instance<a href="#defann_77_2" name="refann_77_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, which clearly states that airports are undertakings submitted to competition law.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, competition law, namely Articles 87 and 86 of the EC Treaty may apply to airports too. Of course, the application of the relevant provisions of the Treaty to the public financing of airport infrastructure must duly take into account the Community interest as well as the general economic interest airports may be entrusted with.</p>
<p>For these reasons it is difficult to give a general answer to an individual case. A case by case assessment is necessary, in order to evaluate if, in the cases at stake, the provision of financial aid has an impact on competition between airlines and between airports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A recent study by the Institute of Public Health Studies in Valencia has confirmed what has been known for years, namely the harmful and indeed fatal consequences of atmospheric pollution for the health of inhabitants of the Planet. 6% of annual deaths are due to atmospheric pollution and, more particularly, to atmospheric pollution caused by the large quantities of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and ozone emitted. It is well established that, apart from industry, exhaust fumes from car motors constitute the main source of pollution.

<p>Over the last few years the Community has agreed a substantial package of measures to protect citizens against air pollution. Directive 1999/30/EC sets ambient air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and lead. A similar Directive, adopted last year, sets standards for carbon monoxide and benzene. All are based on World Health Organisation air quality guidelines. The standards must be met by 2005 or in some cases 2010. But Member States will have to provide the public with information on levels of pollution from the start and must make public plans for improving the worst areas. Proposals setting objectives for ozone, and national emission ceilings to help meet those objectives, are currently before Parliament for Second Reading.</p>
<p>Directive 98/69/EC on light vehicles and Directive 1999/96/EC on Heavy Duty Vehicles are introducing progressively tighter emission limits which will help to meet air quality goals. Directive 97/68/EC is tackling off-road vehicles. Fuel standards are also subject to progressively tighter legislation and the Commission has recently completed a consultation exercise on lowering the sulphur content in fuels to below 10 parts per million.</p>
<p>Member States are implementing the IPPC Directive, amongst others, to reduce emissions from industry. And the proposed revision to the Directive on Large Combustion Plants, also at Second Reading, will further reduce emissions of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>But there is still more to be done. The proposal for a Sixth Environmental Action Programme explains that the Commission intends to set up an integrated thematic programme to develop future policy on air quality. The Clean Air For Europe Programme will aim to ensure that existing legislation is fully implemented, and will review the latest research on health effects and other matters to determine whether standards need to be revised and if so, how they could be met cost effectively. The Commission will present a Communication to Parliament and Council this session, setting out in more detail the aims and scope of the CAFE programme. It is aimed to produce a first integrated strategy by the end of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
