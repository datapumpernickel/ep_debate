He is the MEP who has worked on this matter and who is most familiar of all with it, but he is unfortunately ill at home in Ireland and cannot participate in this debate. I am therefore replacing him, which is not difficult because both my political group and I have the same view as Mr De Rossa when it comes to adopting a position at Parliament’s second reading. We think we have to say yes.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to begin by saying something about the significance of Regulation 1408/71. It is fundamental to free movement in the EU to make it easier for people to move between different Member States and, at the same time, be able to collect various social benefits. Since this Regulation came into force in the 1970s, it has been fundamentally revised. Moreover, improvements have been made along the way. Improvements have been made now too, which is also the reason for the rapporteur’s adopting the position he has.</p>
<p class="contents">When we debated the matter in the committee, there was a large majority in favour of our approving the Council’s common position. The result of the vote was 30 votes in favour and one against. If I remember rightly, this ‘no’ vote was from someone who, in quite general terms, has a poor opinion of free movement and cooperation within the EU. There was, then, considerable unanimity when it came to the debate in the committee and to approving the rapporteur’s position. Since then, a change has taken place in relation to the original position, namely in connection with paragraph 2, which has to do with the fact that, as early as during the discussion in the committee, we knew that there was disagreement between the Commission and the Council when it came to some specific benefits. Since the discussion in the committee, we have found that the wording we used before gives rise to legal uncertainty. We have therefore been advised by Parliament’s legal service to alter paragraph 2. With the support of his political group and of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, Mr De Rossa has thus tabled an amendment that eliminates this legal uncertainty. Otherwise, the rapporteur’s position is the same.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, furthermore, an amendment designed to have us reject the common position. I wish, however, to argue in favour of our following the rapporteur’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we should not delay this process any further. We know about there having been a parallel overhaul of the Regulation itself. Now, the implementing Regulation must also be revised. It would not benefit this process if Parliament were to reject the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and if we look at the matter as a whole and at what we said at first reading, the Council has in actual fact taken a great deal of account, even a <span class="italic">very</span> great deal of account, of the views expressed by Parliament. The two views I am now discussing, that is to say firstly that we must not delay the process and, secondly, that we have to a large extent had our opinions taken into consideration, mean that we should approve the common position, but with the amendment that has been tabled so as to avoid legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the benefits of which the Commission and the Council have different perceptions, these matters should, with the Commission’s consent, be decided by legal bodies. We must not, therefore, pre-empt the decision that may be taken by legal bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot see that it is in anyone’s interest to delay this process or to reject the common position. It is in neither the Commission’s, nor the Council’s nor Parliament’s interests, and it is definitely not in the interests of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased with the considerable progress that has been made on this proposal, both in the Council and in the European Parliament, progress which means it can now finally be adopted. The Commission proposal before us today seeks to update the Community regulations on the coordination of the Member States’ social security schemes in order to take account of changing national legislation, to clarify the legal position regarding certain articles of those regulations and to take account of recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, especially as concerns Annex IIa of Regulation 1408/71.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate particularly on Annex IIa. This Annex contains a list of special non-contributory benefits which are specifically coordinated in the Regulation I have just mentioned. This coordination, which has been upheld by the Court of Justice, is based on the principle of residence. It provides on the one hand that the benefits concerned are not exportable, but on the other hand that the new State of residence is required, on its territory, to grant the benefits provided by its national legislation. Following recent case law of the Court of Justice, it seemed necessary to review the list of benefits in Annex IIa and to check that it contains only benefits satisfying the following criteria: firstly, the benefits must be non-contributory, that is to say paid for out of taxation, and secondly they must be special. A special benefit is half way between social security and social assistance. It is special when its main purpose is to guarantee a minimum subsistence income or when it is intended solely for the specific protection of the disabled. I want to emphasise the major step forward made in the Council, since as a result of the Member States’ spirit of compromise, the review of Annex IIa resulted in a large number of benefits currently included there being removed. This mainly involves benefits which, although intended for the disabled, are intended mainly to make them less dependent by improving their state of health and their lives. That makes them special and they can therefore no longer appear in Annex IIa.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to congratulate your rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, on his excellent report and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on its work. The rapporteur and the committee rightly drew attention to the major improvements this regulation will be able to bring to the citizen and, consequently, the necessity of accepting the Council common position if the progress made is not to be jeopardised. It is true that, as you know, three Member States thought that some of their benefits had particular characteristics that distinguished them from other benefits and that those benefits, five in all, therefore fulfilled the criteria for retention in Annex IIa. Not wishing to prevent the regulation being adopted, since it also brings considerable improvements, the Council agreed to keep those five benefits in Annex IIa pending clarification by the Court of Justice of its case law. The Commission has however reserved the right to ask the Court of Justice to make every necessary clarification concerning those five benefits in the light of the criteria set by the regulation. On the basis of those clarifications and findings of the Court of Justice, the Commission will if appropriate present a proposal revising the list contained in Annex IIa.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make real social progress. It is no doubt regrettable that it has not all been completely finalised, but the progress is such that I believe Parliament has every reason to accept it, thus giving our European fellow citizens a further opportunity to experience the mobility people in the European Union should have without losing entitlement to benefits they need in order to cope with the risks of life. I therefore thank Parliament for its work, Mr President, and, I hope, for adopting this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendment I have tabled can be understood in that sense, and, moreover, when I consider the efforts being made by a number of Member States to convince people that what the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented is poor, then I think that analogy of the walnut and the sledgehammer is true to life.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this debate about? That is something about which I should like to see some clarity. Today, we are debating the annual amendment of Regulation 1408/71 to take account of changes in social legislation and social security schemes in the Member States. This involves incorporation of the ECJ’s case law, and checking whether the elements that accompany those modifications meet the general criteria for mobility and freedom of movement, but also for those of Regulation 1408/71, the Member States’ proposals having therefore been verified beforehand. We are also discussing Annex IIa, which involves verification of certain specific qualities. It is examined whether the proposals contain elements in respect of which certain benefits should be exportable or not. I would mention Dutch social security by way of example, which need not be exported. In Spain, there is assistance or remuneration, as well as benefits for mobility which need not be exported. We have all established this and we are all agreed on this. Every Member State has made some contribution or other to those listings. What I do not understand, though, is that we, although we have laid down principles in the new coordination regulation, still manage to allow a number of Member States to get away with things of which we have said beforehand that they should actually be exportable.</p>
<p class="contents">Normally speaking, I would have left it to the Commission to solve this problem. That is also the reason why we as a group have agreed to this change. Then, however, the Legal Service came on the scene and told us that we in this House cannot approve something that the ECJ has not accepted. We cannot adopt a legislative text containing elements that are unlawful.</p>
<p class="contents">That is when the problem started. What escapes me is why we allow the Finns not to have to export their childcare benefit, the Swedes their benefit for disabled children and care or the British their nursing and care allowance – in respect of which, in fact, a petition has been adopted – while at the same time, we are asking 22 other Member States which are forced to backpedal – including the Luxembourgers, the Greeks and the Spanish – to export those benefits. When the Legal Service said that we should not accept this, I asked why the Council had done so. It is on account of unanimity that a number of Member States do not adhere to the rules. Is this something that we in this House should be condoning? I wonder whether this should not be the last time, and I think that we should simply send a clear and straightforward message, which should also be incorporated in the implementing regulation that we are also still awaiting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on this. It is with a certain amount of reluctance that my Group has signed up to the amendment because we fully understand the frustration that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has just expressed. We feel, once again, that a number of Member States are obeying what they believe to be the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law. However, my Group will not delay the implementation of the other changes that are important and positive for people in order to await suitable cases and the ECJ timetable, since that may not happen particularly fast.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the number of exclusions, not least from the UK, because they particularly affect the lives of the disabled and elderly people. The Department of Work and Pensions’ website describes the disability living allowance and the attendance allowance as two of the most important social security benefits in the UK. The wording is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members will find that they receive letters about the importance of these payments for students studying abroad. While it is true that they can apply to be recognised for particular allowances in other Member States, this is not particularly helpful at times when, for example, in the UK they have to have been resident for 26 out of the previous 52 weeks before being eligible for disability allowance. This is not particularly helpful if they have been a student during the period of October to June. We only have to do the maths.</p>
<p class="contents">We also get letters from people wanting to retire abroad, where the difference in the monies paid makes a considerable difference as to whether they can move to a climate that has a more positive effect on their health and quality of life. Therefore I deeply regret the decision of the UK Government not to include those social security benefits. I believe that its decisions are discriminatory in their effect, a barrier to equal opportunities and do not fit in with the concept of social inclusion as it crosses boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will see some rapid action from the Commission, even if we could not express this in writing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clark, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the IND/DEM Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in his article in the current issue of Parliament’s magazine, Mr De Rossa stated that his resolution was carried unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. But the record shows that one Member voted against. That was me, and I intend to do so again this week with my UKIP colleagues. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="contents">At the centre of Mr De Rossa’s report is a stand-off between the Commission and the Council over the exportability of five benefits, three from the United Kingdom. Mr De Rossa suggests that the report should be adopted without delay, so that Regulation 1408/71 can be tidied up. Then he proposes that the European Court of Justice resolve the dispute over the five benefits. We believe that the decision on the United Kingdom benefit should be left to Her Majesty’s Government, which does not want them to be exportable. Indeed, the Council’s previously stated common position upholds that of Her Majesty’s Government. We therefore deplore the Commission’s change of mind. We believe that it should be for each Member State to define the basis on which its benefits are to be paid and to whom. We absolutely oppose the notion that the deadlock should be resolved by the European Court of Justice. Benefits are part of taxation systems. They are dual systems: taking from and giving back. To interfere in either is to interfere in the taxation system as a whole. Since the EU likes to keep up the pretence that it has no competence for issues of taxation, it should not therefore interfere at all in the benefits system.</p>
<p class="contents">To return, finally, to Mr De Rossa’s article, it is noted that Finland and Sweden also contest the listing of two allowances. We respect their stance. The article shows that the Commission has exempted the Irish carers’ allowance, as the Irish Government wished. It is wrong and iniquitous that the United Kingdom carers’ allowance has not been exempted. As regards the three United Kingdom benefits, let me say unequivocally that Her Majesty’s elected government should be treated like its Irish counterparts in that respect and that should be the end of the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of even greater importance to all those who are incapacitated as a result of disability, sickness or old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased mobility within the countries of the European Union has been accompanied by an increasing number of problems, which must be resolved in as non-discriminatory a manner as possible. For this reason social security systems in the Member States of the European Union must be harmonised so that all cases can receive equal treatment. I support the proposal of rapporteur De Rossa and I will be voting for the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present situation it is more beneficial to support the amendment to Regulation 1408 and, within this framework, to Annex 2A, rather than continuing with fruitless negotiations, since adopting a joint position has involved the Council in protracted negotiations. Time will tell which cases cannot be included in the list of supplements, so I therefore suggest that such cases be resolved individually, impartially and in people’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council has adopted the proposal of Parliament on the mobility supplement, which covers travel expenses for people with disability, and which is exclusively aimed at providing special protection for people with disability. I also welcome the oral amendments adopted by Parliament, whereby Member States should adopt measures which will help to mitigate any unwelcome consequences for those people who will be most affected by the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to emphasise once again that this common position seeks to improve in several respects the rights of European citizens moving within the European Union. May I say that European citizens are really fortunate to be able to move within the Union in this way while being assured in a number of cases of the solidarity they need. That is a real step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances of course – Mrs Oomen-Ruijten will take no offence – the Commission does not support her amendment rejecting the common position because that amendment would jeopardise all the progress made by the Community legislator up until now in the matter of special non-contributory benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in question will result in dozens of benefits that have not been exportable up until now being exportable. There are however still five benefits at issue that have not been accepted as having to be exportable. The effect of Amendment 2 will be that all those benefits will remain in Annex IIa and will therefore continue to be non-exportable.</p>
<p class="contents">I honestly believe that, even if the fate of those five benefits is still uncertain, the agreement reached in the Council and the support, which I believed to be quite broad, in Parliament should enable us to make significant social progress for all European citizens where the remainder of the benefits is concerned. That is why the Commission is keen to see this text adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
