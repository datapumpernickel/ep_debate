<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, in 1997 the process by which fixed and mobile telephony and television and the Internet were increasingly coming together was known by the buzz word 'convergence'. The Commission adopted a much heralded Green Paper on this subject which promised a brave new world of horizontal regulation across platforms. The reality was much more prosaic. Convergence did not happen quite to the extent predicted and the Commission confined itself largely to revising the telecommunications regulation package to take account of new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Since that time, however, we have witnessed a wave of mergers and take-overs in the media with the emergence of vast conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner, CBS, Viacom and Vivendi Universal. Yet the Commission has not explored the idea of cross-media ownership and media concentration in any detail since its 1994 follow-up to the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's silence on such an important issue seems particularly strange because the European Parliament has been calling for a directive on a level playing field and media pluralism since the 1990s. I recognise that regulating the media is a highly sensitive issue. The media is not like any other industry as it lies at the heart of our culture, our way of life. A diverse and pluralistic media is fundamental to democracy, freedom and cultural diversity. But in view of the trend towards media concentration, towards the dominance of certain media conglomerates, my group believes it is high time that we come back to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the principles which should underlie our approach? First of all we must recognise that a thriving media is the hallmark of a free society. If control of the media becomes too narrowly restricted in the hands of a small number of people this poses a danger for democracy. The media needs to be sufficiently diverse for all important points of view in society to be effectively presented. Otherwise there is a danger that dominant media players can restrict access to information and thereby move public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Avoiding media concentration is also important to our economy. Some have argued that with the explosion of different types of media, including digital, satellite and cable television, as well as the Internet, monopolistic control is impossible. However, many of these different channels of communication are now controlled by the same media conglomerates, which can thereby cross-promote these services and provide incentives or pressure advertisers to buy space or air time in other media they control.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, media concentration has implications for our cultural diversity. A Europe in which the media is dominated by a few major players risks being one in which certain regions, cultures and minority groups are granted less access to the media. A diverse media is likely to result in more home-grown original content, whereas large media groups may not resist the temptation to fill their air time with cheap imported programmes and repeats.</p>
<p class="contents">For the ELDR Group there is a clear case to look again at this issue. My questions to the Commission today are: what action does the Commission propose to take? If the Commissioner takes the view, as I suspect he may, that there is no legal basis for action, I would remind him of the articles of the Treaty governing the single market. I would remind him too that Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees media pluralism and if that Charter is integrated into a new constitutional treaty, as Liberal Democrats hope it will be, would that not provide a necessary legal base for action? Will the Commission undertake to bring forward a White Paper updating its 1994 communication in the light of technological change and developments in the industry?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that we cannot ignore the dangers that media concentration poses to our society. The power of media ownership now frequently extends across national borders. Given that a free and diverse media is essential to our continent's democracy, prosperity and cultural vitality, it is high time that politicians face up to their responsibilities and return to this issue.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has tabled this question on media concentration and I must say I am very happy that the initiative has spread throughout the House, because we consider that this is not a single-party or single-group issue, but a concern over a matter of constitutional importance to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We did this because, ten years ago, the Commission put forward a Green Paper on pluralism and the internal market, and proposed – and even drew up – a preliminary draft directive to harmonise national legislation on media ownership. Since then, nothing has happened, and the Commission, which has the monopoly on initiative, should also show that it deserves this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Many things have happened over the past ten years. Significant technological progress has been made – the Internet over written media, cable, satellite television, digital technology – which have transformed the landscape. A concentration process has also taken place which goes beyond our borders and means that certain names have spread and now represent the media throughout Europe, such as Murdoch and Berlusconi. Others have fallen by the wayside, such as Messier and Kirsch, and others are arriving, such as Bloomberg. We must also take account of the developments that are taking place in the United States, where the federal authorities are making changes in order to increase US technological capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, however, Mr President, my group thinks this is above all a democratic issue, because it refers to one of the bases of the system we live in, namely the protection of freedom of speech, which is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society. I am not only referring to freedom of speech as we politicians defend it, but also to freedom of speech for all citizens and also for workers in the press and the media, because it does not make sense for us always to advocate greater democracy for workers in other sectors but not in this one. This should also be extended to the candidate countries, where concern is spreading over the loss of the national character of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, allow me to play devil’s advocate. I said that no progress had been made in ten years. Why has no progress been made? It would be interesting to analyse the matter. Is it because it is very complicated? European construction has always been a challenge and what I would therefore say is that if the directive was necessary, and it was necessary to address this issue, in 1992, it is all the more necessary now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is another of the questions we posed – it could be considered that the legal basis is insufficient. Ten years ago, however, it would appear that it was sufficient. It would be interesting if the Commission were to explain this to us, or otherwise tell us whether it would be appropriate, for example, for this issue to be considered as a matter of fundamental rights in the Commission proposal to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we are aware that this is what is known as a cross-cutting issue. I must say that I am very happy that it is the Commissioner responsible for the protection of consumer rights and health who is to respond to this question, because we are always told that this issue concerns the internal market or competition. It is more than that. It concerns competition, the internal market, culture and fundamental rights. There were four Commissioners I was thinking might appear, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Mr Byrne, who also has to defend us as consumers against this uncontrolled invasion not only of audiovisual messages, which are frequently subliminal, but also against uncontrolled advertising and the monopoly in the field of advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that today’s debate, in which all the parliamentary groups are participating and showing interest, will be a step forward, breaking this ten-year silence and allowing the Commission to exercise its monopoly on initiatives in this fundamental area responsibly.</p>

Since 1997, though, silence has reigned, but now it seems that I can congratulate Parliament on having, like Sleeping Beauty, woken up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like now to speak on behalf of my group. I cannot but underline the arguments of those who have spoken before me, and I would like to pick up two of the significant points they made. Entrepreneurship, on the one hand, has become out of balance with journalistic activity on the other, as it now is also with those who produce creative material. It is for us to restore this balance. The EU, which announced the creation of the internal market as one of its priorities, must assume its political responsibility in this process involving consolidation and concentration. We did not liberalise a few years ago by breaking up media monopolies simply in order to create new media monopolies. Both economic diversity and pluralism in the media are equally under threat. The wide-ranging nature of concentrations merits particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that one of the pillars of democracy is the separation of powers, something that is of especial concern to my group. Having successfully accomplished the separation of church and state, I believe we ought now to devote our energies to separating political power and the media. I am speaking here of a European official culture, especially on the eve of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">One more practical question for the Commission: in 1997, the directive on media ownership disappeared back into a drawer, quite possibly as a result of political pressure, although we cannot be certain of that. We need a better legal basis at European level, but then we know that; it is a statement we heard all of five years ago, and we do not need to have it repeated. Why, then, has the Commission only now started to do something about it? We are all aware of these problems; they are not new, and we do not need to reinvent the wheel. Action is needed, O esteemed Commission! I repeat that I support the arguments of those who have preceded me on the floor, and, as Mr Barón Crespo said, media policy is not a party issue.

<p class="contents">Twenty-two of the thirty-three signatories are from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and others are from the Europe for a Union of the Nations Group, which shows, as has just been said, that this is not a display of particular or party interests but of the concern of all those who care about the basic principles of the liberal state.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that we Italians are particularly sensitive to this issue, but I would ask the House to show some understanding. I want to ask all the German Members of all parties whether they would not be concerned if their Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder owned all the private television networks, one of the major magazines and one of the major daily newspapers. I want to ask the British Members, if they are going to take part in this debate, what their reaction would be if Tony Blair had called publicly for the removal of three famous BBC journalists and had obtained what he wanted in the space of a few months.</p>
<p class="contents">I have brought this up not because these are problems which Europe has to resolve – they arose in Italy and we Italians must resolve them ourselves – I have mentioned it because, in actual fact, what is happening in Italy is different from the situation in other countries but there is one common factor: media concentration, which is becoming a world-wide phenomenon and is in danger of jeopardising media pluralism and thus freedom. As has rightly been said, a line has to be drawn between politics and media reporting. Although this does not by law fall within the sphere of the Commission’s responsibility, Mr President, it is the point which is common to society throughout Europe. That is why we have put the matter to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are among our fundamental values, to which, it is to be hoped, the Convention will give a prominent place in the constitution that will be our common possession.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, Parliament has, over past years, repeatedly done in-depth work on these issues and taken actual developments in the European Union and the Member States as a yardstick when measuring the extent to which these things have become reality. I do not think one can say that Parliament has been asleep. It is not only 1997 that should be mentioned here; I would like to remind you all of what we decided together in 2000 with our position on the fundamental questions relating to the communication and information society in the European Union, and would also refer you to our common position on the revision of the television directive in 2001. That was something on which we did not yield. The only thing is that we have to take a realistic view of how things stand. So far, the results are clear and unambiguous: we have no option but to draw distinctions. The media markets continue largely to be the national markets that they were previously, as is unmistakeably clear in the case of the print media.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is the case that in the electronic media field, the television markets are still predominantly national in character.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, thirdly, be clear to us that development has progressed further. Cross-border developments are increasingly taking place in the electronic media, especially where digital technology is brought into play. This is a question on which we have to focus, examining very carefully what consequences this development is having for the safeguarding of freedom of opinion and information and pluralism of the media in the European Union and in its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has put to you a question with reference to this specific development. We are asking the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the current situation to take up the question of the structural developments observable today in Europe's political, economic and legal media. We additionally ask you to table a proposal for our consideration on what you consider to be appropriate action in order to achieve the objective, which it is to be hoped is shared by us all, of safeguarding the pluralism of the media and of opinion in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that, if we travel together in this direction, we will together take a significant step along the road towards guaranteeing diversity of opinion in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, undoubtedly the media play a crucial role in subjecting the exercise of public and private powers to permanent scrutiny. Media pluralism is therefore of the utmost importance and lies at the very heart of the way our democratic societies operate. Indeed it is one of the core values underlying the European Union, as enshrined in Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which refers explicitly to protecting the pluralism of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I can only endorse what you say regarding the situation in the media sector following developments over the past ten years. I would add that while audiences may be focused on a small number of programmes, European citizens have, nonetheless, a far wider choice in their viewing, thanks to a range of technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this new setting, the Commission has made use of the instruments at its disposal. In applying competition law it upholds freedom of competition in the media, particularly in innovative media services such as the Internet and UMTS. Moreover, it applies the mergers regulation which serves to control the phenomenon of media concentration from the economic angle. In addition, the Community legislator, on the basis of Commission proposals, adopted the television without frontiers directive, the satellite and cable directive and the conditional access directive, which address various aspects of cross-border television broadcasting.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative framework was further supplemented by the e-commerce directive, adopted in 2000, the objective of which is to facilitate cross-border provision of new interactive media services distributed on a point-to-point basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission proposal for a common regulatory framework for liberalising electronic communications networks and services was adopted in March this year. One of its main aims is to open up access to electronic communications networks, including those which carry broadcast content. To this end, it provides that operators who are identified as having a strong market position may have to meet ex-ante obligations on transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation and access to or use of specific facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission monitors closely the transposition of these directives in the applicant countries as well as in the Member States, ensuring that national media legislation remains consistent with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">While existing Community law instruments undoubtedly have positive repercussions on the protection of pluralism, it has to be said that their purpose is to ensure a certain economic balance between players in the context of the internal market. These instruments directly affect the media sector as an area of economic activity and not – or at least only very indirectly – as a vehicle for delivering information to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation stems from the fact that even though pluralism is a fundamental freedom recognised by the EU, it is not one of the tasks assigned to the European Community under Article 2 of the EC Treaty. This is borne out by Article 21 of the mergers regulation, which allows Member States to forbid a merger in the interests of protecting pluralism even where it has been approved by the Commission. Consequently, any new initiative based on internal market freedoms would encounter the same limitation as the instruments I have mentioned and would not ensure the protection of pluralism <span class="italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The question also arises whether such an initiative could be justified by reference to existing Treaty provisions. The Commission is not aware of any concrete obstacles to exercise of the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty, particularly the right of establishment or freedom to provide services within the meaning of Articles 43 and 49, being encountered in the media sector because of national measures designed to protect pluralism <span class="italic">per se</span>. Moreover, any initiative would have to be aimed at eliminating significant distortion of competition. Under Court of Justice case-law, these are the tests for Community action on the basis of Article 95, involving measures to improve the operation of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to consider whether such an initiative would comply with the principle of subsidiarity, since the purpose of legislative proposals based on internal market freedoms must in any event be to establish obstacles to the cross-border provision of services, not to regulate for specific situations in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether it is desirable for the European Convention to provide for the protection of pluralism in general at EU level, I would recall that the Commission, like Parliament, believes the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into the basic Treaty and constitutionally entrenched.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I close with the reminder that the Council of Europe exists, among other things, to preserve cultural pluralism and media diversity. Closer cooperation with that institution should also be envisaged in order to enhance the protection of pluralism in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is twenty-first century dictatorship. If a country’s leader has influence over two national television channels, for example, and therefore virtually all viewers, and under his or her control there is a continually present, manipulative and mesmerising force oozing out of those channels, what we have is an information society oligarchy. This goo can also bring the competition to a halt. When the media drip in every home continually feeds a touted leader’s achievements by means of the results of massive Gallup polls then it is a matter of a new machine, a kind of perpetual motion that keeps itself going with a sense of its own legitimacy. Just look at what is happening in Italy, a country I hold in high regard.</p>
<p class="contents">My own basic point of view is this: the more concentrated media communications are the broader the range of rights journalists must have in their work. It is also wrong to say that a public service is always a monopoly. Not at all: it is controlled by a motley collection of social forces. In certain applicant countries the government might intervene, in which case it is not a public service but government-run television. Competition and markets do not always engender freedom or pluralism either: sometimes it is the opposite. The situation can worsen as a result of concentration. Neither will free commerce necessarily ensure diversity. The markets may be self-regulating, but they just apply other sets of rules that are based on a mutual understanding and are undemocratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, we are calling on you to draft a directive on the concentration of media communications, and its effect on culture, diversity, freedom of speech and the rights of journalists. Commissioner Monti, we are calling on you to investigate whether the rules on competition have been contravened and a dominant market position has been abused, and, Commissioner Bolkenstein, on you to clarify whether concentration, convergence and the new media have a negative impact on the Internal Market. Finally, Commissioner Vitorino, please look into the matter of whether or not our citizens’ democratic and cultural rights are being implemented. We would furthermore like to ask the Commission why it does not draft the directive that we have all been hoping for. The European Convention must also discuss this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this Chamber, we have again and again emphasised the importance of openness and transparency. Citizens must have access to information affecting their lives so that they can take part in the democratic debate and make their choices.</p>
<p class="contents">The media have a central role to play in this process. If they do not operate properly, then neither does democracy. At present, there are media trends that give rise to concern. The consolidation we have witnessed may lead to less pluralism in the media. We combat monopolies because they reduce the supply of goods, with a consequent decrease in prosperity, and the same applies to the media market. Monopolies undermine democratic pluralism and lead to a decrease in democratic prosperity. Previously, party political media such as newspapers were only able to exercise political criticism within their own medium. They had no control over what other media put out. The threat we face today is one of potentially powerful consolidation, which may mean certain points of view not being represented in any medium.</p>
<p class="contents">As legislators elected by the people, we are faced with striking a sensitive balance. To what means can we have recourse to ensure free and diverse media without at the same time setting aside another cardinal principle of a democratic society – that of the distribution of power. We want to set up basic rules that guarantee a level playing field without tampering with the actual content of the media. We need, in this Assembly, to comply with our democratic responsibility and make sure that the media comply with theirs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case in many countries with which we have economic or commercial relations and countries such as Iraq, China, Cuba, Vietnam and so forth. Certainly, safeguarding freedom of information as a guarantee of genuine democracy is a problem for Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two or three points I would like to make in this regard. Firstly, in my opinion, we need to be very sparing in our calls for European legislation, in our calls for the Commission to impose some sort of constraints on a market – the merging telecommunications and media markets – which, we must not forget, has to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets inasmuch as European undertakings have to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets. Now then, overloading a market which is already struggling – there are linguistic and cultural barriers, for example, which make it difficult for companies to grow – with the additional burdens of constraints and restrictions could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a paradox which I would like to point out in this debate. It is absurd that we who, although not members of national parliaments, are representatives of the European institutions, focus a great deal on market dynamics and concentrations but fail to even mention the powerful force of state media companies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Take Italy, for example. It is right to put the spotlight on the situation and it is right to be concerned, as it is always right to be concerned about the relationship between the media and democracy, but what is not being said is that half the information sector is in the hands of the state, in other words in the hands of the parties. This is the case almost throughout Europe. Do we really think that the parties are using their television networks with due respect for the pluralism of information and due respect for the citizens’ right to be informed, or are they serving their own interests and putting across specific information?</p>
<p class="contents">There is another dimension to this, and here I pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Van Miert in the previous Commission. The existence of state television networks is detrimental to the media and information market. State television networks take up space which could be used for the creation of competing firms, possibly even European firms, and the charges, licence fees and funding associated with them siphon off resources which could be redistributed in the market and used to create a plurality of competing companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reflect on all this. I feel that a comment from the Commission on these matters – state aid, competition, the abuse of dominant positions and so forth in the internal markets – would be appropriate too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What surprises me, with regard to competition and pluralism, is that we are essentially looking at this issue from two totally different and contrasting points of view. On the one hand, we are looking at it from the point of view of our countries, the Member States, in which competition can sometimes be very fierce, particularly in Italy, as everyone here knows. On the other hand, we can also look at the issue of pluralism and competition from the point of view of some of the candidate countries; we can even look at the issue of a single source of information which can have an adverse effect on the pluralism called for by Parliament, since it might be thought that, until now, media coverage in these countries depended exclusively on this single source.</p>
<p class="contents">The two extremes of the issue of competition are therefore at opposite ends of the spectrum. It is, however, these two extremes that we must take into account if we are to find, at the same time, a balance between pluralism and a degree of concentration. The balance is certainly delicate, but this is also because – and I do not think that we have emphasised this point enough so far in this debate – it is a question of public service. It is not therefore merely a question of competition among the private media because this problem also concerns public service, and we must achieve a balance between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve such a balance, perhaps the Commission must reconsider its indecision regarding the need for a directive, something that has been called for by Parliament for several years. The Commission must also re-examine the situation of the media, which has changed beyond recognition in recent years. The last study on this subject was carried out in 1994. We therefore call on the Commission to take note of the new difficulties and to propose a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we must also stress the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam has a protocol on the system of public service broadcasting in the Member States. The protocol is an extract from the Treaty of Amsterdam which lays down, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States are responsible for defining and organising these tasks, and for financing them, provided this does not undermine competition. In this area as well, state aid is obviously important and we must highlight and maintain it. That is why all of us here today, and my group in particular, believe that it is necessary to review the need for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as media coverage is concerned, it is impossible to avoid the question of content. A specific characteristic of the market and of competition clearly exists, a specific characteristic relating to content, to creation and which also relates to publishing in particular. Let me remind you of the situation in France – which is of concern to us – where there is concentration in the publishing industry within the new markets which have recently become established. This specific characteristic should be taken into account and we should also stress the urgent nature of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that what the Charter says on pluralism will be respected by the Convention and that the latter will be able to safeguard this pluralism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The media has an extraordinary influence over society, but I believe we have to realise that there is only one way to resist the domination of North American investments in the media and advertising industry and that does not involve media concentration in European Union countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, the President was moved to send a message to parliament on the matter, but I would also like to point out that the highest moral authority, Pope John Paul II, has called for clear, fair rules guaranteeing pluralism, freedom and participation, to avoid the abuse of what are extremely powerful tools having a devastating impact on people’s consciences and society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to point out that this issue affects other sectors as well as politics. During the recent hearing organised by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on television without frontiers, a reporter noted that television is exacerbating the commercialisation of sport and the concentration of advertising resources. Thus, there is a growing divide between the few wealthy sports and the poor sports, and the link between television, advertising, sports rights and the owners of the major football teams is becoming increasingly close. Public television networks can provide alternatives to these tendencies, but we all know that, in the world in which we live, in a liberal society, private, commercial television companies play a major role. However, this role must not be allowed to develop in such a way that the extraordinary power to influence public opinion is concentrated in the hands of a few. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is especially true when one is dealing with political power wielded by a head of government. The name to mention here is Berlusconi. The Italian media tycoon and, in one and the same person, prime minister, along with Mr Murdoch and Herr Kirch, have given the champions of unfettered press freedom a lesson in fear.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Kirch empire has collapsed can be of little comfort in view of the pressure exerted on public service broadcasters by commercial enterprises – I am referring to the cost of rights to sporting events among other things – and in view of an increasing concentration of regional, national and worldwide media with growing cross-border involvements. Media concentration to an illicit degree endangers diversity and pluralism of opinion and the promotion of cultural diversity. Volume 44 of ‘Media Research’ a series of treatises published by the North Rhine-Westphalia Media Institute, has come out in the last couple of days; it gives a powerful description of media concentration's adverse effects on society's democratic and cultural foundations. It also has to be said without equivocation that the rule of law in Italy is in danger. It has already had the worst of the fight. All this leads to only one conclusion, namely that European regulations are needed to limit concentration in the media, because national law does not apply outside the borders of states, or also because – as in Italy – the effort is not even being made. Reference has already been made to the way the Italian State President's profound concern has led him to call for an Italian law to deprive the prime minister of practical political control over the services of the public-sector broadcaster RAI, and to restrict his power as a private individual over the media. Berlusconi is in every respect a special case, and one that it must be hoped will remain unique, involving an array of legal actions relating to tax evasion, forged documents, perjury, payments from slush funds, the bribing of judges and similar things, not all of which have been brought to a conclusion. We therefore call on the Convention to impose a constitutional ban on any such agglomeration of power, which is positively indecent. Even the Pope – or so we have heard – is advocating regulations to safeguard pluralism and freedom of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr Prodi, Commissioners, is why I say it is now time for you to take some action!</p>

As Mr Byrne pointed out to us in an admirably clear intervention, there is no treaty base for it. How is it going to be defined? How far do you intervene politically in issues of media concentration in areas that, as the Commissioner pointed out very clearly, cut across a whole range of other weapons the Commission has at its disposal to regulate monopoly power, a word that has been freely bandied around this Chamber this evening? If there is monopoly power commercially, then the instruments are there to tackle it and they should be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder how many colleagues who have contributed to this debate this evening have actually bothered to read the new package that regulates electronic communications. Mr Watson, who opened the debate, probably has not, because if you look at that regulation – and I was one of the colleagues that worked on it very closely – you will see that it anticipates the fact that we will have convergence and that the big issues that are opened up in the world of convergence are about controlling access to channels. There are provisions in this regulation to open up access, to make access available on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, again key words we should be thinking about in any context, particularly in media. It also makes provision for public service broadcasting, an issue that we ought to be discussing more in this context, to allow governments to open up channels where they feel that public channels should be conveyed to the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">Those issues are already there. Do not ignore them. I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said. Certainly we should invite the Commission to look at this problem, but the last thing we should do is to anticipate the results of that analysis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is for reasons that all of us have very much in mind obviously. Without pluralism, there is no opposition, no freedom and, therefore, no democracy. Without pluralism, the freedom of audiovisual and cinematographic creation would be jeopardised and therefore the cultural identity of Europe would be at risk. It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that the principles of diversity, pluralism and independence of the media are applied in the Member States and in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Media pluralism concerns the broadcasting of information, television and the Internet as well as audiovisual creation. In a constantly changing media environment, the presence of public service television channels and private television channels, as well as restrictions on mergers and acquisitions between commercial players, are essential in order to maintain audiovisual pluralism and cultural diversity. Equally, we must ensure that sufficiently diverse information is broadcast from both public and private sources over all media platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission should carry out a thorough assessment of the media situation in each candidate country and in each Member State. A Green Paper was drafted on this issue in 1997. Today, developments in communication technologies, the key role played by the Internet in spreading information and cable television are phenomena which are pushing us to look again at the issue of media concentration. It is very important, for example, that the Commission begins work as soon as possible on resolving the problems raised by the lack of transparency in granting television licences in the Member States and in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this assessment has been carried out, the Commission will be able to decide to establish competition rules ensuring media pluralism in the event of this proving necessary. Freedom of expression is fragile and can only be guaranteed if genuine media plurality exists, and this is something we must all monitor on a regular basis.</p>

That is the question.</p>
<p class="contents">I say yes, we do. And I would add immediately that it is extremely important that, in future, under the new Constitution, the European Commission should have sole power of initiative. We must not poach on the territory of others. However, we are not discussing forcing the European Commission to do what it cannot and does not want to. The point is that there is now clearly a legal gap. We must admit it and ensure that it is filled. There is already a legal gap thanks to the remarkable, impressive technological innovations that have taken place, but it will be further widened when the Union enlarges to 25 Member States and, in particular, as Mr Watson said just now, when it establishes a new Constitution shortly. The Constitution will include articles which are part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 11 of which enshrines the pluralism of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if we do not introduce new legislation, we ourselves – Parliament, Commission and the Council – will be in danger of actually promoting violation of this Constitution, which we all want to adopt soon. In other words, the only thing we cannot do is nothing. If – and this is something which I bitterly, very bitterly regret – one of the Member States of the Union ranks below the Republic of Benin, below position number 40 in the world in terms of media pluralism, that is not a matter solely or primarily for political dispute within the country concerned, and I am talking about my own country, Italy. No, in my view, it calls for analysis on the part of the European Union followed by the adoption of political, institutional and legal measures – the substance of which will be for the Commission to decide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is not the case! The matter we are discussing is so much more complex and problematic that we must rather be aware that the speed of technological progress is leading, particularly in the field of communications, to the development of new ways of transferring knowledge, new forms of peaceful coexistence of peoples and new lifestyles and mentalities. In other words, communications generate culture, and culture is transmitted via communications.</p>
<p class="contents">One might say that all our lives are now locked in a communication mechanism requiring<span class="bold"> </span>a complete reassessment of all our basic points of reference. The huge increase in information sources and the failure to distinguish between their levels of authoritativeness, the progressive replacement of interpersonal relations with a mediated approach and the expression of opinions on the basis of opinion polls which are not founded on fact, are all factors which ultimately lead to various forms of dissociation, which influence our very beliefs and lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent events in Italy were not the result of this very complex issue of the media. Rather, what happened was that the left, which had controlled state television in recent years, went so far as to attempt to influence the last elections and, in its endeavours to hold the sword of Damocles over its political opponent’s head, put off the issue of regulating the media sector indefinitely and made it very difficult for the matter to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Absence of control and supervision has never brought guarantees or freedom, as many would have us believe. It ultimately fosters the indiscriminate use of extremely powerful tools which, if abused, have devastating effects on people’s consciences and society.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Commission to be the guarantor of this principle of freedom and to propose an appropriate course of action to Parliament and the Council, which could, for example, be the subject of another Green Paper.</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, what is more fundamental in a democracy than the freedom to communicate and receive information?</p>

<p class="contents">This is not enough, however, as the plurality of private operators alone cannot fulfil the fundamental role of information in a modern democracy, nor safeguard cultural diversity.</p>
