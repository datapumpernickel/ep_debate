<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 19-20 June 2008, ‘the European Council underlines that further steps by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in its progress towards the EU are possible by the end of this year, provided that the conditions set out in the December 2005 European Council conclusions, the Copenhagen political criteria and the key priorities of the February 2008 accession partnership are met. In this context, the European Council takes note of the conclusions of the GAERC of 16 June 2008. Maintaining good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the name issue, remains essential.’</p>
<p>The framework for relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is essentially defined by the status of candidate country (conferred by the Council in December 2005), the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (in force since April 2004) and the presence of the European Union’s Special Representative (since 2001). Since 2005, Ambassador Erwan Fouéré has taken on the twin function of European Union Special Representative and Head of the Delegation of the European Commission in Skopje, which facilitates close, high-level communication with the government, the political parties, civil society and the other stakeholders. Moreover, in the spring of 2008, the Commission delivered a ‘road map’ to the government, setting out clear and realistic criteria for the liberalisation of the visa system. The Council and the Commission will closely monitor this process on the basis of an assessment of the progress made.</p>
<p>Moreover, and in general, the Council welcomes the effective transposition of the reforms set out in the Ohrid framework agreement, concluded on 1 August 2001, into the legislative system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0881"></a>

<p>As you know, following the Conclusions of the Council of July 2004, the Community has been gradually introducing a new type of bilateral fisheries agreement: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p>In the Council’s opinion, such agreements make a significant contribution to the eradication of poverty in a context of sustainable development.</p>
<p>From this perspective, two elements of these partnership agreements are worth underlining: on the one hand, to avoid the over-exploitation of stocks, the allocation of fishing opportunities to Community vessels is based on scientific advice and, on the other hand, a proportion of the financial contribution, known as ‘sector support’, is intended to develop the fisheries industry of the partner coastal state.</p>
<p>Poverty is not easy to overcome, and various methods will have to be used to eradicate it. The sector support offered by the fisheries partnership agreements is just one way in which the Community is contributing to the essential aim of eradicating poverty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0883"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>For several years now, to adapt to our globalised world, EU development cooperation has been progressively aimed at regional integration. Indeed, countries within the same region, whether they belong to the group of ACP states, the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT), or the outermost regions, often share the same characteristics (assets or handicaps).</p>
<p>In this context, in May 2004, the Commission presented a report containing a global approach to the particular features of the situation of the outermost regions (ORs), aimed at defining the measures required for their development in accordance with their specific needs<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Council has examined the communication from the Commission.</p>
<p>Then, in September 2007, the Commission presented to the Council and to the European Parliament, in particular, a review of this strategy and forecasts for the future<a href="#defann_4_2" name="refann_4_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In their 18-month programme for the Council<a href="#defann_4_3" name="refann_4_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the French, Czech and Swedish presidencies have planned to continue work on the full introduction of the 2004 strategy for the outermost regions, on the basis of the Commission communication on the review and forecasts for this strategy. In May, an interinstitutional and partnership conference on the future of this strategy was held in Brussels.</p>
<p>The results of these deliberations have just been published in a new Commission Communication<a href="#defann_4_4" name="refann_4_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, dated 17 October 2008: ‘The outermost regions: an asset for Europe’. This recommends developing the unique characteristics of the ORs and using them to help meet the challenges facing Europe and the world, such as: climate change, migratory flows, and the sustainable management of maritime resources and agricultural products. One chapter is, in fact, dedicated to the strengthening of regional integration, and it states that the 2007-2013 territorial cooperation programmes, cofinanced by the ERDF, offer opportunities for the development of the action plan for the wider neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Nor should it be forgotten that there are specific provisions in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) negotiated between the EU and the ACP countries, the aim of which is to ensure that these countries are integrated more within their regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has endeavoured to get young people to participate in formulating and implementing national and European policies which affect them directly.</p>
<p>In its resolution of 27 June 2002<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on the ‘Framework of European cooperation in the youth field’, the Council noted that it was extremely important for policies and initiatives affecting young people, at both national and European level, to take into consideration their needs, situation, living conditions and expectations. To this end, it has become a central element of youth policy that there is regular consultation, at both national and EU level, with young people whenever policies which affect them are drawn up and implemented. Practical instruments to facilitate the active participation of young people in civic life and also a regular dialogue with young people have therefore been included in the framework of European cooperation in the youth field.</p>
<p>In practical terms, in the aforementioned resolution, the Council adopted four thematic priorities for cooperation at EU level, including the active participation of young people in public life. As a result, the Member States have adopted common objectives on youth participation and information and have agreed to report regularly to the Commission on the implementation of these objectives.</p>
<p>In addition, in its resolution of 15 November 2005<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, concerning ‘the implementation of the European Youth Pact and promoting active citizenship’, the Council invited the Member States and the Commission to begin a structured dialogue with young people and youth organisations at European, national, regional and local levels on political measures which affect them. As a result, forums for structured dialogue and debate have been created at all levels, according to a schedule determined by the EU’s policy programme.</p>
<p>Finally, in its resolution of 12 December 2006<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, on ‘implementing the common objectives for participation by and information for young people in view of promoting their active European citizenship’, the Council confirmed the pertinence and validity of the common objectives and the lines of action aimed at encouraging young people to participate in public life, stressing that these objectives remained essential to the development of active citizenship amongst young people, especially amongst those with fewer opportunities.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is suggested that the Member States more clearly define the obstacles to the participation of given groups and disadvantaged young people and encourage the introduction of measures and mechanisms to overcome these obstacles, notably by taking account of the diversity and of the priorities of these populations.</p>
<p>The Council’s resolution of 22 May 2008 on the participation of young people with fewer opportunities in particular called upon the Commission and the Member States to ensure, in cooperation with youth organisations, that the structured dialogue with young people with fewer opportunities was open to all, at all levels, and, if necessary, to adapt the format of the meetings. </p>
<p>Also in 2008, the Green Paper of 3 July, ‘Migration and mobility: challenges and opportunities for European education systems’ and the communication of 18 September, ‘Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment’ are texts in which the European Commission has been able to stress the importance of the issue of migrants’ languages.</p>
<p>The Council resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy to promote multilingualism in particular called upon the Member States and the Commission, within the framework of their respective competences and in full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, to support and use the language skills of immigrant citizens as a means to strengthen both intercultural dialogue and economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, in Marseille from 5-9 July the Council Presidency sought to bring to the forefront the relationships built between youth, education and migrants’ languages. Some workshops agreed on the importance of a partnership between public authorities and youth organisations in the creation of legislative texts which affect young people, especially in relation to education and to language learning.</p>
<p>From the same perspective, the ‘New perspectives for intercultural dialogue in Europe’ conference, held on 17-19 November 2008 in Paris, highlighted the importance of education in intercultural dialogue and of its role in promoting social cohesion and the integration of migrants.</p>
<p>In 2009 an assessment will be made of the general framework of European cooperation in the youth field, which will no doubt provide an excellent opportunity to examine how young people could play an even more significant and effective part in public life.</p>
<p>Since the specific issue of the teaching of the language and culture of migrants’ countries of origin has a direct effect on the lives of young people, it goes without saying that the Member States have been encouraged to listen to young people’s views on this issue. However, this falls within the national powers of the Member States and must therefore be examined at national level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At their informal meeting of 7 November 2008, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union Member States stressed that the necessary reform of the international financial system should be included in the set of challenges which the European Union and its Member States remain determined to face, in particular, food security, climate change and the fight against poverty. They also stressed that the European Union would ensure that developing countries were fully involved in this process.</p>
<p>Thus, at the Doha International Conference on Financing for Development held between 29 November and 2 December, at which over 90 states were represented, the European Union supported the principle of a high-level conference on the financial and world crises and their impact on development. This conference, the details of which will be announced by the President of the United Nations General Assembly by March 2009, will address issues of international financial architecture. It is scheduled to take place next autumn.</p>
<p>In Doha, and on the basis of the guidelines adopted by the Council on 11 November 2008, the European Union re-affirmed its commitment to dedicate 0.7% of GNI to development aid in 2015 and the need to take into account the new financial, economic and environmental challenges.</p>
<p>As the current financial crisis is likely to have a major impact on the populations and the economies of developing countries, the EU drew the attention of all the donors to the situation and the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people, in the firm belief that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could still be achieved in every region, including Africa, provided that all of the development partners take immediate, properly targeted measures to accelerate progress. Achievement of all eight MDGs is a shared responsibility: all the partners should honour the commitments they have made.</p>
<p>On the strength of the declaration approved by the Council on 11 November, whereby it ‘committed to working with its partners to explore new ways to contribute to financing sustainable economic, social and environmental development, promoting the implementation of innovative mechanisms to mobilise the additional resources and making policies more coherent’, the European Union has invited the international community to take further steps to introduce innovative financing to ensure sustainable development aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0897"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the context of the EU’s Drugs Strategy (2005-2012)<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and, given that the first of the two action plans under this strategy (2005-2008<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) is due to come to an end, the Council is in the process of examining the EU’s second new drugs action plan, which was proposed by the Commission<a href="#defann_7_3" name="refann_7_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and which covers the Union’s priorities in the fight against drugs for 2009-2012. This action plan is a dynamic instrument and is focused on achieving practical results in the specific priority areas.</p>
<p>This second action plan<a href="#defann_7_4" name="refann_7_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> provides a framework for a complete, balanced and integrated approach to combating drugs, by addressing all of the links in the chain, from drug production to the social rehabilitation of addicts. The objective of this plan is to reduce both the supply of and demand for drugs, using several specific measures, and to extend international cooperation. In comparison with the 2005-2008 plan, it is more concise, and the number of actions is more targeted.</p>
<p>It follows that, on the supply side, the plan aims to improve the effectiveness of enforcement at EU level in order to hinder the production and trafficking of drugs, using an intelligence-based approach which makes full use of the capacities of Europol and other existing European-level structures. It includes substantial new directions, for example, on alternative development in producer countries, on the strengthening of legal and police cooperation, and even on the identification, seizure and distribution of criminals’ assets.</p>
<p>One of the new features, and a cornerstone of the plan, is the creation of a ‘European Alliance on Drugs’, which aims to mobilise civil society and the public sector in favour of an awareness campaign on the risks of drug-taking.</p>
<p>The Council would also point out that, in order to stop the flow of drugs into the EU from third countries and to agree on a coordinated approach, the Council is holding regular or ad hoc dialogues on this issue with producer countries and countries on drugs routes, including those in Latin America, the Caribbean, the Andean countries, Afghanistan, Russia and the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at its meeting of 24 October, the Council focused specifically on West Africa as a new transit point for cocaine arriving from Latin America<a href="#defann_7_5" name="refann_7_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is up to the Member States, the Commission, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Europol, Eurojust and the Council to implement the action plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware that Egypt has proposed a specific plan to attempt to resolve the conflict in Sudan. Under the aegis of the chief AU/UN mediator, the former foreign affairs minister of Burkina Faso, Djibril Bassolé, the political process has been re-launched with unprecedented speed. Support for these efforts is coming from the facilitation work of Qatar, whose involvement alongside Mr Bassolé is crucial. Contacts at Doha are on the increase. Qatar’s approach, in coordination with that of the AU and the UN, differs from the calls by the Arab League for the UN Security Council to suspend the ICC’s investigation of the Sudanese President.</p>
<p>The Council supports the mediation of Mr Bassolé and the Qatari facilitation efforts. It is in close consultation with both players via the Presidency and the European Union Special Representative for Sudan. The regional players, especially Egypt, must play a full part in this process.</p>
<p>The Council calls on the Sudanese authorities and the rebel movements resolutely to commit to the search for a political solution to the Darfur crisis, not least through the cessation of violence, as this is the only way to create an environment favourable to dialogue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0901"></a>

<p>Where poultry meat is imported from a third country, the regulation implementing the regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets (‘Single CMO’ regulation) stipulates that the poultry sector must indicate the country of origin on the packaging or on a label. This regulation also requires the labelling to show other information in addition to the country of origin (price, abattoir accreditation number etc.).</p>
<p>As for poultry marketed within the European Union, the provisions of Directive 2000/13/CE apply. These provisions include the obligation to indicate on the label the place of origin or provenance of the foodstuffs, where failure to do so would be likely to mis-lead the consumer as to the real origin or provenance of the foodstuff.</p>
<p>The Council is, however, open to considering the possibility of greater clarity of labelling information for poultry products and, in particular, to examining the option of a uniform country of origin mark (identical system for imports and intra-community trade), provided that proposals are submitted to it by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0903"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the conclusions that it adopted on 8 December 2008, the Council pointed out that the renewed consensus on enlargement, approved by the European Council of 15-16 December 2006, remains the foundation of the EU’s enlargement strategy. This renewed consensus rests on the consolidation of commitments, on equitable and rigorous conditionality, on improved communication and on the capacity to integrate new members.</p>
<p>In its conclusions, the Council also pointed out that the tempo of the negotiations continues to depend, in particular, on the progress achieved by Turkey in meeting the required conditions, including the fulfilment of the opening and adjournment criteria and of the requirements defined within the negotiating framework, which specifically cover the implementation of the partnership for membership and compliance with the obligations arising from the association agreement. Lastly the Council pointed out that the chapters for which the technical preparations are complete will be provisionally opened or adjourned, in line with the procedures laid down, in accordance with the negotiating framework and subject to the Council of 11 December 2006. In this context, the Council awaits with interest the Intergovernmental Conference with Turkey scheduled for December, during which further progress in the negotiations should be recorded. It should be remembered that, since negotiations with Turkey began, eight chapters have been opened, and analysis of the progress (screening) is complete for twenty-two chapters.</p>
<p>As for the chapters that cannot be opened in accordance with the Council’s conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council regrets that Turkey has so far failed to fulfil its obligation to implement, in full and in a non-discriminatory manner, the additional protocol to the association agreement and that it has not made any progress either towards normalising its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. Progress is now urgently awaited.</p>
<p>To conclude, I wish to re-affirm the Presidency’s intention to spare no effort in opening up new chapters for negotiation with Turkey during the Intergovernmental Conference, which will take place in December.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0906"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has not examined the issue raised by the honourable Member, as Iceland has not applied to join the European Union. However, the EU and Iceland already cooperate in several areas, particularly within the framework of the European Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>As far as the procedure for EU membership is concerned, Article 49 of the EU Treaty specifies that ‘any European state which respects the principles specified in Article 6(1) may apply to become a member of the EU. It shall address its application to the Council, which shall act unanimously after consulting the Commission and after receiving the assent of the European Parliament, which shall act by an absolute majority of its component members.</p>
<p>The conditions of admission and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the Union is founded, which such admission entails, shall be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and the applicant State. This agreement shall be submitted for ratification by all the contracting States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.’</p>
<p>In 1993, the European Council defined the ‘Copenhagen’ criteria, which specify that ‘membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Membership presupposes the candidate’s ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.’ The European Council also specified that ‘the Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries’. In December 2006, it pointed out that ‘the enlargement strategy based on consolidation, conditionality and communication, combined with the EU’s capacity to integrate new members, forms the basis for a renewed consensus on enlargement’.</p>
<p>When a European State applies for membership, where appropriate, the Council asks the European Commission to assess the candidate State’s ability to satisfy the conditions for membership and, in particular, to comply with the EU’s fundamental values.

<p>On 31 October and 1 November Bernard Kouchner, acting in his capacity as representative of the Council Presidency, travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and, in particular, to the town of Goma. On 10 November the Council discussed the situation in the DRC and subsequently adopted new conclusions, in which it expressed its deep concern about the growing conflict in North-Kivu and the consequences for the population in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and for the region as a whole. In response to the emergency situation, the European Union took action to provide humanitarian aid to the populations suffering from the conflict, with additional contributions of over EUR 45 million (Member States and Commission). In addition, the European Union has actively contributed, via intense diplomatic activities, to the search for a political solution, which is the only means of ensuring a permanent return to stability in the region. The EU is determined to continue its efforts along these lines, especially within the framework of the International Facilitation effort. The EU Special Representative to the Great Lakes region, Ambassador van de Geer, is present on the ground almost all of the time and is very involved in the International Facilitation work. As such, he maintains very close links with the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, Mr Obasanjo, the former President of Nigeria. The High Representative for the CFSP and the Presidency of the Council are in very regular contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to ensure suitable European support for the UN’s work in the DRC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0910"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on driving licences<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which will come into force from 19 January 2013. This directive contains provisions against forgery and against the practice known as ‘driving licence tourism’. In terms of the fight against forgery, Articles 1 and 3 and Annex I of the said directive impose a single model European driving licence in the form of a plastic card and require the Member States to take all necessary measures to avoid the risks of forged driving licences, including for model licences issued before the entry into force of the aforementioned directive.</p>
<p>For the purposes of combating ‘driving licence tourism’, Article 7 introduces a maximum administrative validity of 10 years for driving licences (point 2. a) and establishes the principle of one person only per driving licence (point 5. a). Member States are required not only to refuse to issue a driving licence if they discover that the applicant already holds a driving licence but also to refuse to issue a licence to, or to recognise the validity of a licence of, a person whose driving licence has had a restriction attached or has been suspended or withdrawn in another Member State (Article 11(4)). In order to facilitate the application of this provision, the Member States are required to use the European Union’s driving licence network, which holds the necessary information on the issuing, replacement, renewal and exchange of driving licences.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In relation to the EU’s most ambitious objective of curbing and reducing the loss of biodiversity on its territory in 2010<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Member States and the Commission are making great efforts to implement the multitude of practical measures laid down in the second EU action plan of 25 May 2006<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on biodiversity, entitled ‘Halting the Loss of Biodiversity by 2010 – and Beyond’. This action plan aims, among other things, to increase the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Union’s horizontal and sectoral policies, such as the agriculture, forestry, rural development and fisheries policies. It follows that, in its conclusions of 18 December 2006<a href="#defann_14_3" name="refann_14_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Council asked the Member States and the Commission to re-double their efforts to fully implement the ‘Natura 2000’ network, both on land and at sea, and to guarantee effective management and adequate financing of the network, which aims to ensure biodiversity by conserving natural habitats and wild fauna and flora on the territory of the Member States. Deforestation and forest degradation are major factors in the loss of biodiversity. On 4 December, the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission’s communication: ‘Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss’. These conclusions include the objective of halving gross tropical deforestation by 2020 and of stopping it completely by 2030. In this context, the Council is now waiting for the Commission to present its proposals on the ‘biodiversity package’, which should include a mid-term report on the progress made in implementing the above-mentioned action plan.</p>
<p>The French Presidency is fully committed to mobilising the positions and actions of the entire EU in many international biodiversity protection forums, in particular within the framework of</p>
<p>-the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, the parties to which met for the fourth time on 15-19 September 2008,</p>
<p>-the 10th Conference of the Parties to the Ramsar Convention, held from 28 October to 4 November 2008,</p>
<p>-the meeting on the memorandum of agreement on the conservation of birds of prey,</p>
<p>-the meeting of the parties to the Convention on the Conservation of migratory species, held at the start of December 2008 in Rome.</p>
<p>The EU is also committed to studying the creation of an international mechanism to provide objective scientific knowledge on biodiversity and to define policies on the issue, as established at the United Nations Environment Programme Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity and ecosystems services, held in mid-November 2008.</p>
<p>Finally, in May 2008, the ninth meeting of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was held in Bonn. This meeting took place in a context of extreme urgency in terms of the fight against the impoverishment of biodiversity at international level. Thanks to the special commitment of the EU Member States and of many partners, it has been possible to mobilise substantial funds within the framework of the ‘LifeWeb’ initiative. These funds will help countries that are rich in biodiversity but less developed economically to better protect their fauna and flora and their ecosystems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The financial crisis naturally represents a challenge for the revised Stability and Growth Pact as it will mean testing the flexibilities introduced when the Pact was revised in 2005.

On 2December, in its contribution to the European Council on a coordinated European response on growth and employment, the Council specified that, in addition to the monetary policy and to the measures already taken to stabilise the financial sector, the budget policies should play an important role in stabilising the economy, using the complete set of automatic stabilisers and also additional budgetary and fiscal measures. This coordinated response should be consistent with the objective of long-term stability of public finances and should make judicious use of the flexibilities offered by the Stability and Growth Pact.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Association Agreement between the EU and Jordan signed on 24 November 1997 entered into force on 1 May 2002.

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the information published in the media, according to which, on 21 April 2008, Jordan’s Attorney General, Mr Hassan Abdullat, undertook to prosecute eleven Danish and one Dutch citizen, accusing them of blasphemy and of threatening public order.</p>
<p>Freedom of expression is a fundamental right for all the Member States of the European Union. As the honourable Member knows, and in accordance with international laws, such freedom also includes duties and specific responsibilities. This means that limits to freedom of expression may be authorised by law, in certain conditions, and that penalties may be provided for, should such limits be exceeded.</p>
<p>It is therefore the responsibility of each society to define what constitute acceptable limits to freedom of expression, in accordance with international human rights standards. Under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, the Member States of the European Union do indeed recognise that freedom of expression may be subject ‘to certain formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society’, especially for ‘the protection of the reputation or the rights of others’. Other countries have an even more restrictive approach, developing press codes that prohibit various behaviours, in particular the denigration of religions or their symbols.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is therefore to determine whether a ban on the denigration of religions or their symbols complies with universal human rights. The EU’s Member States do not believe that it does: for us, human rights are not intended to protect religions or their symbols, but rather to protect men and women throughout the world. We abide by the letter of the provisions of international law relating to human rights.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the denigration of religions is perceived in some countries as an act of intolerance which attacks not only faith but, indirectly, those who hold such a faith. Moreover, as in the case in point, the denigration of religions can cause public order disturbances. The maintenance of public order is one of the accepted limits to freedom of expression in the international standards.</p>
<p>As you will have gathered, there is a lively debate on the limits to the exercise of freedom of expression, where human rights are cited both as the guarantee of such freedom and as a reason further to restrict it. I can assure you that the EU Member States are making many efforts to maintain the dialogue with everyone on this important issue not only within international forums but also in discussions on human rights that the EU holds with third countries, in which it asserts its position. This approach is the most effective way of making the EU’s points of view known, the cultural dimension of this debate being particularly sensitive for all concerned.</p>
<p>The Council considers that this question is of major importance, and it will therefore continue actively to encourage dialogue and understanding, tolerance and mutual respect in application of human rights, via all existing mechanisms, especially those laid down in the agreements between the EU and Jordan. In this respect, the EU has again reminded the Jordanian authorities of our commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental democratic principles, during the last meeting of the EU-Jordan Association Council of 10 November 2008.</p>
<p>The Council will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0931"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>To date, the Council has not received a Commission proposal aimed at introducing a ceiling for taxes on oil or concerning the creation of a fund to help consumers.</p>
<p>The Council believes that oil stocks are some of the means that could help both to control energy prices and to guarantee energy security. The honourable Member will be aware that, since 1968, the Council has had in place a mandatory system for the creation of emergency oil stocks, by the adoption of the Directive (68/414/EEC) on oil stocks (codified and repealed by Directive 2006/67/EC<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). The coordination mechanism included therein works well in the case of minor disruptions, especially in response to joint actions coordinated by the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
<p>The Council also welcomes the fact that the Commission recently submitted to it its second strategic analysis of energy policy,<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which includes, among other things, a proposal to revise the Directive on oil stocks, with the specific aim of re-inforcing the consistency with the IEA system and of increasing the reliability and transparency of oil stocks through the weekly publication of stock levels. This is in line with the conclusions of the European Council of March 2007 which, in its action plan ‘An Energy Policy for Europe’<a href="#defann_18_3" name="refann_18_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, stressed the importance of increased transparency of data on oil products and a re-examination of the EU’s oil supply infrastructures and oil storage mechanisms, with a view to supplementing the crisis mechanism provided for by the IEA, particularly as regards availability in the event of a crisis. The Council is looking forward to a fruitful working relationship with the European Parliament so that it can make rapid progress on this important issue.</p>
<p>In relation, more generally, to the second strategic analysis of energy policy, the Council debated this during its meeting of 8 December, paying particular attention to energy security, and will continue its work over the next six months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has taken due note of the written declaration on rheumatic diseases issued by the European Parliament on 5 June 2008.</p>
<p>In the context of an ageing society, and given that the majority of people aged over 70 present chronic or recurrent rheumatic symptoms, the 18-month programme for the French, Czech and Swedish Presidencies underlines the support for all initiatives aimed at creating a social environment in which the elderly are treated with respect and dignity. They should be able to lead a healthy, active and independent life, playing a role in society and enjoying a better quality of life. When they do need care, they should receive high-quality care, with dignity. Preventive measures in the health field are essential for preserving the health of citizens and avoiding future increases in healthcare spending.</p>
<p>Community action in the public health field must fully respect the Member States’ responsibilities in relation to the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The Council has already adopted conclusions on obesity, nutrition and physical activity, which are very important factors in the prevention of rheumatic diseases.</p>
<p>In the Council conclusions of 10 June 2008, a mechanism for cooperation between the Council and the Commission for the implementation of the EU health strategy was established. The first area of activity selected is the promotion of a culture of quality in health services, which will also benefit people who present musculo-skeletal problems and who require medical treatment.</p>
<p>With regard to the creation of a Community strategy to combat rheumatic diseases or a strategy to improve access to information and to medical treatment for these diseases or a Council recommendation on early diagnosis and treatment of these pathologies, the Council has not had any initiatives on these issues referred to it by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0945"></a>

<p>The EU’s position on the issue of the additional protocol to the association agreement is clear. The complete and non-discriminatory implementation of the protocol is a contractual obligation on Turkey and it is imperative that it be complied with. This position, which appears in the negotiating framework and in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council, and also in the declaration of the European Community and of its Member States of 21 September 2005, has been pointed out to Turkey on several occasions, not least within the framework of the political dialogue which the EU maintains with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p>Referring to its conclusions of 10 December 2007, in its conclusions on enlargement of 8 December 2008, the Council regretted that Turkey had so far failed to satisfy its obligation to implement, in full and in a non-discriminatory manner, the additional protocol to the association agreement and that it had not made any progress towards normalising its relations with the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Therefore, in accordance with its conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council reiterated that it would continue closely to monitor and examine the progress made on the issues covered by the declaration of the European Community and of its Member States of 21 September 2005.</p>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The various concerns raised by the honourable Member of the European Parliament are shared by the Council.</p>
<p>The Council would point out that it re-iterated its support for the principles of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, re-launched at the Annapolis Conference, in the GAERC conclusions of 8 December 2008. On this occasion it called on the parties to respect the commitments entered into under the road map and to implement significant changes on the ground to promote peace in the region.</p>
<p>The Council considers that continued colonisation constitutes one of the main obstacles to peace and calls into question the viability of the future Palestinian State. It asks the Israeli authorities to comply with international law and to put an end to its colonisation activities, including those linked to ‘natural growth’, including in East Jerusalem. On 10 November the Council expressed its deep concern at the destruction of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem. This position has been communicated to the Israeli authorities, at various levels. On 5 December the Presidency of the Council of the European Union welcomed the Israeli Government’s decision to evacuate a Palestinian house which had been forcibly occupied by Israeli colonists. The Council calls on Israel to take other actions to strengthen the diplomatic process under way.</p>
<p>The Council is deeply concerned about the restrictions on the freedom of movement and travel imposed by Israel in the West Bank and in Gaza. On 14 November the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expressed its deep concern at the latest blockade of Gaza, which is illegal under international law, and asked the Israeli authorities immediately to re-open the crossing points into the territory to allow the entry of humanitarian aid. In parallel to this, the Council calls for an immediate end to the firing of rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council points out that the European Union attaches the greatest importance to respect for human rights in the Palestinian Territories. The freeing of the Palestinian prisoners held in Israel is a crucial step towards restoring a climate of mutual confidence essential for the progress of the peace negotiations. The Council calls on the Israeli authorities to free more of the Palestinian detainees.</p>
<p>The issues of the prisoners and of the anti-Palestinian violence committed by the colonists are among the matters raised in political dialogues between the EU and Israel. The creation of human rights subcommittees, involving the EU and Israel, on the one hand, and the EU and the Palestinian Authority, on the other, demonstrate the EU’s interest in human rights in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0956"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the December 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 203 of the EC Treaty, only representatives of the Member States’ governments may participate in Council meetings. Because of the role assigned to it in the treaties, the Commission also attends. Finally, in some specific cases, the treaties allow for the presence of representatives from other bodies, such as the European Central Bank. This rule applies mutatis mutandis to the meetings of all the Council’s preparatory bodies, and especially COREPER. It follows that representatives from industry or business may not therefore attend these meetings.</p>
<p>Contacts with the social partners may occur, including at the highest levels, as at the tripartite social summit, the last meeting of which took place on 15 October 2008, or at the Macroeconomic Dialogue, which meets twice a year and which is attended by the Presidency of the Council, the presidents of the European employer and trades union associations and the President of the European Central Bank and two commissioners. In addition, the members of the Employment and Social Protection Committees regularly meet representatives of the social partners. Mention may also be made of the regular meetings between the Presidency, the social partners and NGO members of the ‘social platform’, where informal discussion of issues on the Employment and Social Policy Council agenda takes place.</p>
<p>In addition, contacts are equally desirable, but in an informal setting, with representatives from industry and business.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0958"></a>

<p>The sheep-farming sector has been hard-hit over the last ten years by a series of crises affecting the ruminant livestock sector. Two statistics tell the story: the total number of small ruminants fell by 7.6% in the EU as a whole in the period from 2000 to 2006; and if no action is taken, sheep and goat production could decline by over 25% by 2015. That is why I decided to table two amendments to the budget headings in the general budget for 2009 relating to sheep and goat premiums and to the additional premiums for producers of sheep meat or goat meat in less-favoured or mountain areas (increasing them by €20 and €15 million respectively). The Council, when voting on the second reading of the draft budget for 2009, decided to reject my proposal. Would the Council publicly state its reasons for rejecting this proposal at a time when it is proving possible to renegotiate all the rules (on VAT, the Stability Pact, revision of the FP, etc) in order to save the banks?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The sheep- and goat-farming sectors are facing an unprecedented crisis, exacerbated by the epizootic of catarrhal fever.

That is why the European Parliament adopted at first reading, at the October part-session, two amendments by Mrs Catherine Guy-Quint to the 2009 general budget adding €35 million of aid to the sector. Yet in spite of the urgency of the situation and the European Parliament's insistence, the ministers rejected these amendments in the course of the conciliation on Friday, 21 November 2008.

<p>(FR) I wish above all to stress the importance the Council attaches to the agricultural sector, which is essential to the European economy, and in particular to the direct subsidies to farmers, especially in the sheep and goat sectors.</p>
<p>In this context, I would stress that, during the Council meetings of 29-30 September and 27-28 October, the Presidency and many Council members drew the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the policy to be followed on blue tongue disease and, in particular, on a vaccination strategy.</p>
<p>At its second reading of the draft 2009 European Union budget, the Council considered that, in relation to the ‘Conservation and management of natural resources’ (heading 2 of the financial framework), the estimates made by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, amended by letters of amendment No 1/2009 and No 2/2009 were an appropriate response to the needs, taking into account the market situation in the period concerned.</p>

Regular contacts with the Chinese authorities will continue within the framework of the various dialogues undertaken by the two parties. The European Union is especially pursuing the negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement and also foresees the signing of cooperation agreements and projects upon which agreement with the Chinese authorities has already been reached.</p>

<p>In June 2008, under the Slovenian Presidency, the Council reached a political agreement on the ‘road transport’ package, which consists of three legislative acts concerning access to the occupation of road transport operator (<a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2007/0098(COD)">2007/0098 (COD)</a>), access to the market in the carriage of goods by road (<a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2007/0099(COD)">2007/0099 (COD)</a>), and access to the market for passenger travel by coach and bus (<a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2007/0097(COD)">2007/0097 (COD)</a>), respectively. The Council is currently working on a common position on each of these matters, to be presented to the European Parliament in January 2009. The future Czech Presidency is firmly committed to starting informal discussions with the various rapporteurs in order to examine the possibilities of arriving at an agreement with the European Parliament as quickly as possible. In this respect, the honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the fact that, until the end of October 2008, the Bulgarian and Romanian versions of the above-mentioned draft legislation had not been sent by the Commission and that, as a result, the preparatory procedural work has not been able to progress.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0919"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the crucial role played by sport as well as of the potential sport has for forging a sense of belonging. However, as stated in the White Paper on Sport, the organisation of sport and of competitions on a national basis is part of the historical and cultural background of the European approach to sport, and corresponds to the wishes of most European citizens. In particular, national teams play an essential role not only in terms of identity but also to secure solidarity with grassroots sport, and therefore deserve to be supported.</p>
<p>The responsibility for sport lies either with national authorities, or with sports organisations, or with a combination of these. In this context it should be remembered that the idea of having European flags on the sporting clothes of athletes was already highlighted in the Adonino Report "The Europe of the Citizens"<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The choice of whether and how to publish results from the Olympic Games belongs to the organisers, bearing in mind that the selection system in certain disciplines allows Europe to send more athletes to the Games (27 teams), which raises the chances to earn medals compared with other participants. The Commission therefore underlines that Member States participate in the Games as nation states and to recall that the slogan of the EU is: "United in Diversity".<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Honourable Member will therefore understand that the Commission is unable to support initiatives for a tally of medals won under the European flag. As concerns the display of two flags during the next Olympic Games, the Commission, while certainly not opposing the display of such a symbol of unity, wishes fully to respect the autonomy of sport and the primary responsibility of Member States as regards sport policy. Support by the Commission could however be provided were such an initiative to be launched in full agreement with the competent bodies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission applies the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) in conformity to the provisions in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact. When the government deficit exceeds 3% of GDP the Commission has to prepare a Report in conformity with Article 104(3) of the Treaty.

<p>(EN) Fostering good health in an ageing society is indeed a key objective of the EU Health strategy 2008-2013 and of the Health Programme.</p>
<p>The Health Strategy foresees actions to improve the health of older people, including guidelines on cancer and work on neuro-degenerative diseases. In this context, the Commission plans, for example, to put forward a Community initiative to help address Alzheimer next year.</p>
<p>The Commission also seeks to ensure that different policy initiatives contribute to healthy ageing and help health systems adapt to the demands of the ageing population.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission promotes the exchange of good practice in this area. For example, the Health Programme has recently financed a project that issued recommendations on healthy ageing policies.</p>
<p>But fostering healthy ageing is much more than measures targeted at old people. Many chronic diseases experienced by older people can be prevented if people live healthier lives when they are young. This is why the strategy advocates prevention and promotion throughout the lifecycle, with initiatives targeted at people of all ages including the young. Commission action in this area includes the European Platform for Action on Diet, Nutrition and Physical Activity, and the strategies on alcohol and nutrition.</p>
<p>The Commission is also supporting Member States in their efforts to promote healthy ageing. Under the Open Method of Coordination on Social Inclusion and Social Protection, the Commission takes a keen interest in the initiatives proposed by the Member States on health promotion and disease prevention targeted at the elderly population.</p>

There is, moreover, already Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which coordinates social security schemes and contains rules on reimbursement, prior authorisation, etc.</p>
<p>What guarantees have been built in by the Commission so that a Member State's own health care system is not put under any unnecessary pressure, and how does the Commission intend to clarify the situation for patients now that the new Directive is to co-exist alongside Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on social security schemes?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As regards the question of impacts of the proposal for a Directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the Member States' healthcare systems, the impact assessment shows that the additional costs of treatment arising from these proposals are not likely to be such as to undermine the sustainability or planning of health systems overall.</p>
<p>This is because under the proposed Directive citizens are only entitled to be reimbursed for healthcare that they were entitled to at home, so Member States only have to pay for healthcare that they would have had to pay for in any case. The impact assessment estimated that the additional costs of treatment would be a small fraction of overall health expenditures, and is far outweighed by the benefits of this proposal.</p>
<p>But in any event, if in the short term an unpredictable surge of cross-border healthcare were to cause a major problem - in planning local facilities, for example - the proposal allows Member States to put in place limits necessary to safeguard their overall system, such as the introduction of a prior authorisation system for patients seeking cross-border hospital care under the conditions set out by the Directive which reflect the case law of the Court.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the long term, the added value of European cooperation on issues such as European networks of centres of reference; sharing assessments of new health technologies; and using information and communication technology to provide more efficient healthcare ("e-health") will help to improve the quality and efficiency of all healthcare, both for those patients who move and those who do not.</p>
<p>As regards the question of relationship of this Proposal with the existing framework for coordination of social security schemes and in particular the Regulation (EC) No 1408/71<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the existing framework for coordination of social security schemes will remain in place alongside the proposed Directive, with all the general principles on which the regulations on coordination of social security schemes are based.</p>
<p>Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 ensures that if the appropriate care for the patients' condition cannot be provided in their own country without undue delay, then they will be authorised to go abroad, and any additional costs of treatment will be covered by public funds. Whenever the conditions set out in Article 22(2) of this Regulation are fulfilled, the authorisation shall be granted and the benefits provided in accordance with it. This is explicitly recognised by the proposed Directive. Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 will therefore continue to provide the general tool and the "safety net" to ensure that any patient who cannot have access to healthcare in their own country within a reasonable time will be authorised to receive that healthcare in another Member State.</p>
<p>The proposed Directive provides an additional option for cross-border healthcare, responding to the cases brought by citizens themselves which led to the jurisprudence of the Court. It is important to underline that the rights stemming from the jurisprudence and from this proposal do not detract from any rights existing under national frameworks or Regulation (EC) No 1408/71. They represent rights recognised to citizens that they can choose to exercise. They thus provide better access for all to different healthcare within the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Convention creates a legal obligation for its Parties to adopt and implement effective measures to protect people from second-hand smoke in indoor workplaces, public places and public transport.</p>
<p>All Member States currently have some form of regulation aimed at limiting exposure to second-hand smoke. However, the scope and character of these regulations differ widely.</p>
<p>According to the information available to the Commission, slightly over a third of Member States provide for effective protection from tobacco smoke in all indoor workplaces and public places, as required by the WHO Convention.</p>
<p>Total bans on smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces, including bars and restaurants, are so far in place in Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Italy, Malta, Sweden, Latvia, Finland, Slovenia, France and the Netherlands have introduced smoke-free legislation allowing for special enclosed smoking rooms.</p>
<p>However, in more than half of the Member States, citizens and workers are still not fully protected from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces and public places. Bars and restaurants are a particularly difficult area of regulation.</p>
<p>To support Member States in adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Recommendation on smoke-free environments in 2009.</p>
<p>A detailed overview of Member States' smoke-free policies will be presented in the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the need to upgrade the legislation on the welfare of pigs taking into account new scientific evidence as presented in the reports adopted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).</p>
<p>The Commission has already started the work to evaluate the best option to improve the current situation taking into account the need to consider the strategic priorities of the Community Action Plan for the Welfare of Animals and in particular the option to incorporate in its future proposal specific measurable animal welfare indicators, where available. There might still be a need for minimum standards regarding the farming system, housing conditions and feeding procedures, but the development of animal based welfare indicators should contribute to a better assessment of the animal welfare situation “on farm” and hopefully better and more rapid enforcement of welfare standards keeping them in line with new scientific evidence.</p>
<p>In the light of the above the Commission is examining the possibility to elaborate a proposal to revise the 1998<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> general legislation for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes as well as the specific requirements on pigs to upgrade the standards foreseen in the related legislation. Any proposal should also consider the objectives of the new Animal Health Law, foreseen in the EU Animal Health Strategy<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the possible use in European legislation of internationally recognised animal welfare indicators, once developed, should allow better enforcement and the promotion of higher welfare standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Commission has estimated that this approach could allow the comparison of animal welfare standards with international trade partners and hopefully facilitate their use outside the border of the Community.</p>
<p>Several research projects are ongoing to support this initiative, including the Community funded research project called "Welfare Quality - Science and society improving animal welfare in the food quality chain". The delivery of "Welfare Quality" is expected in 2009 and the intention of the Commission is to work on the possible options to revise the existing legislative framework in 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Written Declaration of 5 June 2008 on rheumatic diseases<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> calls inter alia on the Commission to develop a Community strategy for rheumatic diseases. According to article 152 of the Treaty, Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Commission has supported the important area of rheumatic diseases through the programmes of Community action in the field of public health. A new project for a 'European Musculoskeletal Conditions Surveillance and Information Network' has been selected for funding in 2008. This project will contribute significantly to promote better understanding, knowledge and information on musculoskeletal conditions in the EU.</p>
<p>In addition, the ongoing 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research (2007 – 2013), under the “Health” Programme, proposes to undertake collaborative translational research in major diseases. Rheumatic diseases are explicitly mentioned in this section.</p>
<p>As a result of the 2007 call for proposals, which included a topic on "early processes in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases", the proposal "Masterswitch" was selected. Focusing on the elucidation of the mechanisms triggering rheumatoid arthritis and potential cellular and molecular targets for its therapy, it integrates 17 leading research groups from 10 EU and associated countries for an overall contribution of € 11,2 million. Continued support for research on this subject in future calls within the 7th Framework Programme is expected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the occasion of the recently held European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> conference on 6 November 2008 in Budapest, it is important to note the support given by the Commission in highlighting the importance of rheumatic diseases (RD) as a subset of Musculo-Skeletal-Diseases (MSD) for Safety and Health at Work, and its interconnectedness with the Communities anti-discrimination policies.</p>
<p>Finally, and specifically on musculoskeletal disorders, the Commission, in its Communication "Improving quality at work: Community strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work"<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, has expressed its intention to find ways of improving risk prevention with regard to musculoskeletal disorders.

<p>According to research carried out by Athens University, Greece is leading the way as regards the privatization and commercialization of the health system.

But decisions on security and defence policy issues would continue to be taken by unanimity, and the commitment of troops by any Member State to a particular mission would remain a sovereign decision by that State.

<p>(EN) At the European Council in March 2007, EU Heads of State and Government committed themselves to three ambitious 20% objectives by 2020: (1) a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990, (2) an increase to 20% of the share of renewable energy sources in EU overall energy consumption and (3) a reduction of projected energy consumption by 20%.</p>
<p>For the European Union to achieve these objectives, energy efficiency is a crucial area where progress can be made. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way of reducing energy consumption while maintaining an equivalent level of economic activity. Improving energy efficiency also addresses the key energy challenges of climate change, energy security and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The 20% energy saving objective is non-binding as it has not been fixed by legislation. However, progress towards the emissions reduction and renewable energy sources targets will certainly trigger investments in energy efficiency improvement measures in the sectors of energy transformation, energy supply and industry. This will then contribute to the achievement of the 20% energy savings objective.</p>
<p>The Commission does not foresee making the saving objective binding, as it leaves more flexibility to the Member States to improve energy efficiency in their key energy consuming sectors according to their own strategies. However, the Commission is convinced that by combining efforts on the policy and implementation levels, the drive for energy efficiency could be increased and higher levels of energy savings achieved. The Commission adopted in 2006 the European Energy Efficiency Action Plan with the objective of mobilising policy makers and market actors to make buildings, appliances, means of transport and energy systems more energy efficient. The implementation of the Action Plan is ongoing and should be completed by 2012. A comprehensive energy efficiency package of proposals and decisions was recently adopted by the Commission on 13 November to strengthen efforts to deliver the 20% objective in 2020. The Commission will evaluate the European Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0900"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers involving young people in EU affairs as an essential element for a long term development of European citizenship. This understanding is reflected in numerous programmes and activities carried out at national, regional or local level by different Commission services and in close cooperation with national authorities.</p>
<p>At central level, the main EU Programme for young people, Youth in Action, aims to inspire a sense of active citizenship, solidarity and tolerance among young Europeans, and to involve them in shaping the Union's future.</p>
<p>Since 2003 the European Youth Week provides young people with a platform and an opportunity to participate in EU policy making and includes cultural events and political debates organised throughout Europe. Furthermore, in order to foster experiencing and involvement of young people with EU affairs, representatives of youth organisations are invited to the EU institutions for discussions with EU policy makers. This forum provides the Commission with the opportunity to consult young people on matters of particular concern to them as well as to engage them with European issues and enhance their knowledge of European institutions and policies.</p>
<p>This involvement is complemented by the European Youth Portal, which not only offers information to young Europeans, but also allows them to have their views heard and questions answered. The portal gives information on 8 main themes, covers 31 countries and is available in 25 languages.</p>
<p>Every six months, the Commission also organises in-service training for more than 600 "stagiaires". The traineeship provides young university graduates with a unique, first-hand experience and knowledge of the workings of the EU institutions Thus, the traineeship creates an informal network of multipliers and "ambassadors" of EU values and ideas.</p>
<p>There are also a number of decentralised initiatives addressed to schools, including the Back to School project and Spring Day for Europe. As part of the Back to School project, EU staff is sent out as ambassadors to their former schools to discuss EU issues with pupils.</p>
<p>Spring Day for Europe is an annual initiative set up to stimulate interest about the principles, achievements and future of the EU. It constitutes a unique opportunity for pupils to meet and exchange ideas with EU experts and political leaders, learn about European integration and improve their understanding of it through games, debates and chats.</p>
<p>Finally, young people are a priority in the Commission's campaign to encourage participation on the EP elections next year. This campaign aims to raise awareness about the EU's role and helps create an emotional identification with the European Union among young people. The Commission plans to run a pan-European multimedia campaign for young people, involving popular TV channels, social networking platforms and tailor-made election spots for young people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0902"></a>

<p>(EN) Credit unions are in principle subject to the Community legislation regarding credit institutions, in particular the Capital Requirements Directive (2006/48/EC).

Member States may regulate these credit unions as they see fit, provided that they comply with their general obligations under the Treaty.</p>
<p>Most credit unions provide personal savings services and loans, rather than loans for a professional purpose.

<p>Micro-credit providers in general will benefit from any progress made on strands 1 and 2 of the Commission's micro-credit initiative, launched in November 2007. If a credit union qualifies for receiving any support from JASMINE, a joint action of the Commission and the European Investment Bank to support non-bank micro-finance institutions in Europe, it may be able to obtain some technical assistance to improve governance practices and technical capability, and thus improve its potential to attract further investment from private sector sources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0905"></a>

<p>(FR) The European Police Office (Europol) is an essential player in the internal security of the Union and has been associated with recent operational successes. For example, last summer Europol contributed to the BAGDAD operation, which mobilised 1 300 police officers in nine countries and led to the arrest of 75 persons involved in a human trafficking network.</p>
<p>On the issue of cooperation between Europol and the EU Member States, the quality of Europol’s work depends to a large extent on the willingness of the Member States to contribute to supplying the Information System or to the operation of the Analytical Work Files (AWFs). It is the responsibility of each Member State therefore to ensure that its law enforcement agencies cooperate appropriately with Europol.</p>
<p>As for Europol’s cooperation with third countries or other organisations, Europol has concluded around 20 strategic or operational agreements. Only the latter allow the exchange of personal data. Europol is currently in discussion with half a dozen other countries, but it is not its role to conclude agreements with the whole world. The cooperation agreement with Eurojust, concluded in 2004, should also be amended by the end of the year to reinforce the quality and intensity of their relationship.</p>
<p>In more general terms, the honourable Member could consult the 2007 Annual Report, which has just been published on the Europol website.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the replacement of the Europol Convention by a decision of the Council, an agreement was reached on 18 April 2008; the formal adoption of this decision now depends on the removal of Parliament’s reservation.

<p>(EN) By 10 November 2008, although 595 transposition measures were notified to the Commission for Directive 2005/36/EC<span class="sup">1</span>, only 8 Member States had fully achieved the transposition of the text. 3 Member States had not communicated any transposition measure yet.</p>
<p>Meeting the transposition deadline (20 October 2007) has proven to be difficult for Member States mainly for the two following reasons:</p>
<p>- the very large scope of the Directive (it covers all regulated professions) which requires adoption of numerous pieces of legislation. In some Member States transposition is done per profession;</p>
<p>- the administrative structure of some Member States: in some countries transposition has to be done both at federal and regional level.</p>
<p>The Commission regrets this situation which is a source of legal uncertainty for professionals seeking to exercise a regulated profession in a host Member State. It has decided to bring the non compliant Member States to the European Court of Justice. Besides, citizens can also invoke most provisions of the Directive directly in front of national courts.</p>

<p>The Commission needs to be made aware of the health threat posed by pollen from Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a plant which is one of the hundred most dangerous invasive alien species in Europe. Pollen from this plant cause serious allergic and respiratory complaints, often with incapacitating symptoms, whose social and individual costs are far from negligible. In some regions, the environmental and health authorities have reported that as many as 15% of the population have been affected and the scale of the problem is growing. Around fifteen Member States, applicant countries and pre-accession countries are directly affected, in some cases very seriously. The difficulty of containing the pollen and the speed with which it spreads mean that it is more urgent than ever for Europe to act to mitigate its effects.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, is the Commission aware of the current environmental and health situation as regards the spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in European countries? Will it draw up a coherent legal framework for invasive alien species?

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the threats posed by invasive species including Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., the common ragweed.</p>
<p>Many people are highly allergic to the pollen of this plant, which evolved in North America, but has been established in Europe since the late 1800s. August and September are bad months, when, in infested areas, its pollen can become far the most common in the air. It infests the valleys of the Rhone and the Po, and areas of Hungary, Serbia, and Croatia. It has also been detected in Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and Belgium, and, outside the EU, in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Since the plant can only spread through its seed, it can be contained if the plants are prevented from producing seed, either by killing it with herbicides or by chopping it down or uprooting it before it seeds.</p>
<p>Asthma and other respiratory diseases are one of the most common cause of morbidity in people, having a serious health impact.</p>
<p>In order to tackle this issue, the Commission is using a comprehensive and integrated approach, which includes several measures and actions to prevent respiratory diseases tacking key health determinants. This comprises legislation and actions on ambient and indoor air quality including airborne allergen exposure.</p>
<p>An EU research project funded under the 6th Research Framework Programme delivered a European wide inventory on invasive alien species. Detailed information as well as experts' contacts are available under http://www.europe-aliens.org/index.jsp" </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Another project is being supported on the health impacts of airborne allergen. The aim of the project is to evaluate the effects of climate diversity and change on airborne allergen exposure, and to implement an outdoor allergen early warning network. This will allow prediction of airborne allergen exposure and will provide patients, medical doctors, and health regulatory agencies with better information to protect, treat and prevent allergic disease from ambient airborne allergens.</p>
<p>As part of its wider efforts to protect biodiversity, the European Union (EU) is committed to substantially reducing the impact of invasive species. The Commission has adopted a Communication "Towards an EU Strategy on Invasive Species"</p>
<p><a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 3 December 2008, which outlines policy options and measures for immediate implementation with a view to develop an EU strategy on invasive species. Horizontal issues such as awareness raising, research and funding issues are also addressed.</p>
<p>This Communication should promote a debate with the Member States, EU Institutions and stakeholders. The Commission will use the feedback received to develop a proposal for an EU Strategy for release in 2010, which should substantially reduce the impact of invasive alien species in Europe. The Commission will also examine the possibility of setting up an Early Warning and Information System based on a regularly updated inventory.</p>

Beyond its obligations to provide legislative and policy proposals <a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in all official EU languages, the Commission is committed to making all possible efforts to treat citizens, cultures and languages equally within the limits of available resources.</p>
<p>The use of a wide range of EU languages on the websites of all the Institutions is important to European citizens. In line with the "Action Plan to improve communicating Europe by the Commission", in 2005<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission set up a service dedicated to web translation, within its Directorate-General for Translation. Still, it remains a challenge to continuously make relevant information available to EU stakeholders and citizens and to keep this information updated.</p>
<p>Citizens show a considerable interest in the Commission's websites, including in the cultural field, and the Commission therefore places high priority on maintaining up-to-date sites with a maximum of news. The use of languages follows the general principle of adapting the language policy of each site to its target audience, and to provide the content on the upper levels of each site in as many languages as possible</p>
<p>In order to bring its cultural initiatives as close to citizens as possible, the Union has established Cultural Contact Points to promote the Culture Programme in the participating countries. One valuable activity of the Contact Points is to reproduce in the national language(s) elements of the news appearing on Europa on their own websites (which are in turn linked to Europa).</p>

Moreover the consumer organisation Test-Aankoop has submitted a petition with more than 5 000 signatures to the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.

<p>The Commission further understands that the Belgian and the Luxembourg authorities will continue discussions to find a solution to the current difficulties for the almost 20,000 depositors concerned.</p>
<p>The different treatment of the Finnish and the Belgian savers is due to the different applicable laws. Whereas Kaupthing Bank Finnish Branch is a branch of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing and is governed by Icelandic law, Kaupthing Bank Belgium is a branch of the Luxembourg subsidiary of the Icelandic bank. It is therefore technically a Luxembourg entity regulated by Luxembourg law since Luxembourg is its home Member State. Therefore, Luxembourg is responsible for the supervision of this bank, as well as for its reorganisation/liquidation and for the compensation of the depositors under the Deposit Guarantee Directive (Directive 94/19/EC on deposit-guarantee schemes). This responsibility extends to the Belgian branch.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed improvements to the Deposit Guarantee Directive on the 15<span class="sup">th</span> of October. The main changes proposed relate to the coverage levels and the reduction of payout delays.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has introduced the concept of supervisory colleges in its proposal of 1<span class="sup">st</span> October 2008 on amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive (2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC). Co-ordination through colleges will allow for better supervision of cross-border banking groups.</p>
<p>The above along with further legislative proposals by the Commission that may become necessary to take account of market developments should help prevent similar situations in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0927"></a>

<p>(EN) When adopted in 2000, one of the main objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) was to simplify the number of instruments regulating EU water policy by establishing a coherent framework capable of managing all uses, pressures and impacts. In 2013, the Shellfish Water Directive (2006/113/EC<a href="#defann_55_4" name="refann_55_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>) and other legal instruments will be repealed once the programme of measures under the first WFD River Basin Management Plan is fully operational. According to recital 51 and Article 4.9 of the WFD, at least the same level of protection afforded by the old legislation should be achieved by the implementation of the WFD.</p>
<p>The WFD clearly states that protection of water bodies used for the production of shellfish should be firmly established by Member States in the first WFD River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) to be adopted in December 2009, in accordance with the provisions of the Shellfish Water Directive. This means:</p>
<p>All areas designated under the Shellfish Water Directive must be included in the register of protected areas of the WFD.</p>
<p>The RBMP must establish specific objectives for those water bodies that, in addition to those set by the WFD (good ecological and good chemical status), offer at least the same level of protection as the Shellfish Water Directive. In particular this includes the microbiological parameter faecal coliforms. This level of protection for these existing areas should be maintained for the subsequent updates of RBMP.</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth recalling that according to the WFD Member States should submit the draft RBMP to public consultation in December 2008. The shellfish industry and other stakeholders should use the public consultation to verify that all shellfish waters are registered as protected areas and that the water quality objectives of the Shellfish Directive are adequately included in the RBMP.</p>
<p>In the context of the aquaculture strategy under preparation, the Commission Services are currently considering various options to ensure that new shellfish areas established after 2013 receive at least the same level of protection as existing designated areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Emigration of young graduates at the beginning of their careers, as well as of scientists and teachers, is one of the thorniest problems for the States which have acceded to the European Union in the 21st century. Many students take advantage of the offer of free higher education, the cost of which is borne by the tax-payer and amounts to tens of thousands of euros. After having studied in their own country, they find far better paid employment in the old EU Member States and go to work there. Being concerned to reduce the adverse impact of the brain drain, some EU Member States require students to work in the country where they have studied for a period equal to that of their studies. If anyone fails to respect this contract, they must repay the full cost of their studies.</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of this measure, which is applied in some EU Member States and serves to retain young graduates, particularly scientists and teachers? What other compensatory measures does the Commission propose for Member States which are losing their skilled workers and for their education systems?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Member States are free to organise their education systems and labour markets as they wish, as long as EC law is respected. The obligation on a young graduate to work for several years in the Member State in which he or she trained and to refund the training costs incurred if that obligation is not met could amount to a breach of the EC rules on free movement of workers.</p>
<p>The Court has held that the EC rules on freedom of movement of persons are intended to facilitate the pursuit by EU citizens of occupational activities of all kinds throughout the EU, and to preclude measures which may place EU citizens at a disadvantage where they wish to pursue an economic activity in the territory of another Member State. Provisions which preclude or deter a national of a Member State from leaving his or her country of origin in order to exercise his or her right to freedom of movement therefore constitute an obstacle to that freedom, even if they apply without regard to the nationality of the workers concerned<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In the light of the case law, the Commission considers that the obligations at stake could amount to an obstacle to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, in particular the free movement of workers as they might preclude or deter young graduates for several years from working in another Member State.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Court's case law, national measures liable to hinder or make less attractive the exercise of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty must fulfil four conditions: they must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (no difference on the basis of nationality); they must be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest; they must be suitable for securing the attainment of the objective which they pursue; and they must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. A decision as to whether or not the national measures concerned could be justified would need to be made in the light of the details of those measures, which are not known to the Commission.</p>
<p>In general, skill shortages in the Member States are a multi-faceted challenge and are often caused by other factors in addition to emigration, such as greater demand for internal labour due to economic growth. The way that challenge is met depends very much on a country's specific situation. Typically, it will require a suitable policy mix, consisting of such components as measures to increase general labour-market participation, further improvements to education and vocational training, adequate pay and working conditions for public-sector employees, incentives for return migration and the facilitating of both internal labour mobility and immigration from outside the EU.</p>
<p>At all events, policies to retain young graduates would need to be well designed in order to avoid unintended consequences. For example, in many areas of research, it is vital for young scientists to go abroad for a certain period to gain experience, knowledge and international recognition in their fields, before returning to their home countries.</p>
<p>In the context of European research policy, one often refers to “brain drain” versus “brain gain. The Commission overall considers that international mobility is positive and, in an increasingly globalising world of research, even indispensable in terms of acquiring new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, researchers are traditionally among the most mobile as they tend to look for the best conditions in terms of infrastructure, financing and other working conditions. It is also worth noting that a community of researchers active in another country does not represent a net loss of intellectual input and potential. On the contrary, many members of the so-called “scientific diasporas” can be of benefit to their home country in that they often communicate and network with scientists at home.</p>
<p>As part of the integrated European strategy for training, mobility and career development of researchers, the Commission puts the emphasis on enhancing “brain circulation”, both within the EU and worldwide rather than on the more restrictive concepts of “brain drain” and “brain gain”. In the context of the European Research Area, “brain circulation” is closely linked with the Commission’s policy on increasing the attractiveness of European research in terms of quality of the research teams, infrastructures, salaries and career perspectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission, Parliament and Council signed the political declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership on 22 October 2008. This is the first time that Parliament, Council and Commission have agreed on a common approach to communication. They recognised that communicating on the European Union requires a political commitment of EU institutions and Member States and that it is more efficient and effective, if communication is done in a coordinated way on priority issues.</p>
<p>Agreement on common communication priorities is at the centre of the political declaration. Inter-institutional Group on Information (IGI), co-chaired by representatives of each institution agreed that European Parliament elections are one of the four annual common priorities for 2009.</p>
<p>The Parliament and the Commission are involved in a non political awareness raising campaign. The Commission aims to work in close cooperation, to support and complement the communication efforts of the Parliament by demonstrating what exactly the EU has achieved in areas crucial to citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission is active in promoting multilingualism and cultural diversity in its communication policy in general and in its European Parliament election campaign in particular. The framework of Communicating Europe in Partnership will help to develop synergies with national, regional and local authorities as well as with representatives of civil society and therefore to adapt the campaign to multilingual and culturally diverse context.</p>
<p>The Commission Representations and the European Parliament Information Offices in Member States will cooperate with national authorities in order to set up joint activities adapted to national conditions. Successful implementation of the common communication priorities, including the European Parliament election campaign, may be ensured on the basis of appropriate administrative arrangements between the services at EU and national levels.</p>
<p>Activities and materials for this communication campaign are going to be produced in all the official languages of the EU.

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for his question on the draft Regulation for a European Research Infrastructure legal framework and on Commission actions to help less developed regions of Europe to close their scientific and technological gaps.</p>
<p>It should first be clarified that the ERI regulation is designed to facilitate the joint establishment and operation of large research facilities of European interest by Consortia led by several Member States and countries associated to the Community R&amp;D Framework Programme.</p>
<p>It is intended for infrastructures that are at the frontier of scientific excellence and require major investments that go beyond the financial and scientific capacity of a single country. Planning and coordinating such projects between several European partners enables critical mass to be achieved and specialisation and mutual learning at European level. Many such projects have been identified by ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) in their roadmap of 2006 (updated this year). They include infrastructures in many scientific fields, such as observatories for environmental sciences, data banks in genomics or state of the art large super computers.</p>
<p>Research infrastructures should help to safeguard scientific excellence of Community research and the competitiveness of its economy, as based on medium-term to long-term forecasts, through the efficient support of European research activities. To achieve this they should have the ambition to enhance European scientific capabilities beyond the current state of the art and thereby contribute to the development of the European Research Area.</p>
<p>The ERI legal framework was proposed by the Commission in response to the request of Member States for a tailor-made legal form to facilitate and speed up the construction of new research infrastructures involving several Member States, since current instruments have proven not suitable. ERIs will improve access and excellent research services to the European research community at large, to researchers from countries with many infrastructures as well as from countries with less infrastructures.</p>
<p>In relation to the geographical distribution of ERI, it should be noted that although the Commission will register eligible proposals for use of the ERI legal form, the planning as well as the financing of research infrastructures is clearly a competence of national authorities. It will be they that will present proposals and the Commission will register those that are eligible regardless of their locations. National authorities will decide together all the specific aspects, such as membership, contributions and location of the seat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Commission will seek to encourage new entities that represent added value in the European Research Area and encompass as far as possible regional partner facilities. Many large research facilities (for example 28 out of the 44 in the ESFRI roadmap) are distributed research infrastructures that will be based in several states, either because they must be physically distributed (e.g; environmental or geological monitoring) or because the centres of scientific excellence are distributed. Such distributed structures, already stimulated through the "Integrated Activities" supported within the 6<span class="sup">th</span> and 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP6 and FP7), will pave the way towards a balanced development of the European Research Area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission will seek to encourage as far as possible open access to research infrastructures for scientists and engineers from a wide geographical area. It will particularly seek to promote access based on scientific excellence or need, rather than solely based on ability to pay.</p>
<p>Community funding for infrastructures is available under Cohesion Policy, in conformity with the relevant Community legislation. Indeed the Commission has recently published a guide to using and combining funding from various Community sources (research, cohesion and competitiveness funding)<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Convergence regions could make smart use of structural and cohesion funds in order to leverage financing from European research infrastructures and to submit convincing candidatures for hosting these.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Commission supports the scientific and technological development of the potential of Regions through FP7 specific activities under the Capacities programme.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the new legal framework of the ERI will be open to eligible proposals from partners throughout the European Union and countries associated to the research framework programme. The Commission will continue to encourage those countries that are relatively weak in research performance to invest and catch up, but it will be for those countries’ national administrations to join in presenting eligible proposals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In her statement of 21<span class="sup">st</span> November, the Commissioner in charge of External Relations and Neighbourhood policy, while commending recent positive steps taken by Belarus, made it clear to the Belarusian authorities that the EU was following closely the case of Mr Barazenka.

<p>The current situation in the desperately poor country of Haiti is being called the most serious&lt;br /&gt;environmental crisis on the planet. While the country has been pounded by violent storms, 98% of all its forest have been cut down for fuel, which means that even ordinary storms lead to flooding. Experts say that it will be years before the country can cultivate even half of the food needed to feed the population. And even this can only happen with a massive injection of money and energy into watershed restoration, essential services and food security.</p>
<p>That being so, it is absurd that it will be five months before Haiti can expect major debt relief from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. At the same time Haiti’s entry into the group of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) has been postponed. In the interests of the country’s reconstruction it is necessary for the shareholders in the World Bank to look together at how they can cancel Haiti’s debt as soon as possible. What is the Commission’s view of this postponement, and will it be taking any action in consequence?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Haiti has passed the decision point and remains eligible to reach the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, managed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is important to stress that Haiti has made far greater than average progress along this path, which means that, when the time comes, its USD 650 million debt will be able to be cancelled.</p>
<p>According to the provisional timetable, the decision on the achievement of the HIPC initiative completion point has been postponed until June 2009, following the IMF’s and the World Bank’s announcement that Haiti has not, at present, fulfilled all the disbursement conditions. One essential condition was the law on the award of contracts, which should have been voted on by the parliament within 6 months of the presentation of the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty document (NSGRP – November 2007). Currently, there is a decree on public contracts but it has not been promulgated. The sustained application of the criteria is intended to ensure that the desired results of the debt reduction are long-lasting.</p>
<p>The international institutions and all of the partners are trying to overcome this situation. Thus, for example, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has announced a one-year postponement of the repayment of its debt and a freeze on the Republic of Haiti’s debt servicing payments.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to be in favour of the initiatives to reduce Haiti’s debt as a way of accelerating the country’s economic and social development. The Commission remains committed to supporting the efforts of the authorities and the people of Haiti and to implementing an ambitious development programme, which will guarantee lasting benefits that generate progress. To this end, within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), the Commission will allocate EUR 291 million of programmable funds to Haiti to support the road infrastructure, the de-centralisation process, the justice sector and the general macro-economic framework. Independently of this, the Commission is offering the necessary aid to the victims of the recent floods in order to improve the population’s humanitarian situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0941"></a>

<p>(EN) In reply to the oral question of the Honourable Member, the Commission recalls that it opened infringement cases against many Member States regarding restrictions, notably in form of criminal sanctions, on freedom to provide sports betting services by gaming operators who were granted a license in another Member State, estimating that these restrictions were incompatible with Article 49 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the opinion of the Honourable Member that the arrests in Greece of two intermediaries from a private sports betting operator licensed in another EU Member State might be disproportionate and incompatible with Articles 43 and 49 of the EC Treaty, provided that, as clearly mentioned in the Placanica Judgment<a href="#defann_64_2" name="refann_64_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of the European Court of Justice, the Member State at issue refused to grant licenses or authorisations in breach of Community law. According to the Gambelli Judgment<a href="#defann_64_3" name="refann_64_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the Court of Justice such a breach of Community law exists when a Member State does not pursue a policy aiming at genuinely reducing gambling opportunities in a consistent and systematic manner.</p>
<p>However, for some time now, Member States' reluctance to accept the European dimension of this issue appears to be changing. This follows the opening by the Commission of infringement proceedings against 10 Member States in relation to the restrictions which they impose on the cross border provision of sports betting services. This has led some Member States to consider adopting new laws and a number of them are now discussing their proposals with the Commission.

<p>The Commission is very committed to the protection of all cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) and would like to recall that within the EU, the capture or killing of cetaceans is prohibited under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which includes obligations arising from the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, also known as the Bern Convention. The sale or exchange of cetaceans is also prohibited by EU Member States according to the same Directive. In addition, the introduction of cetaceans into the Community for primarily commercial purpose is banned, pursuant to Council Regulation 338/97/EC on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which implements the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in the EU.</p>
<p>However, the pilot whale hunt mentioned is conducted in the Faroe Islands, which is not part of the EU, so EU legislation and policy do not apply there. Moreover, while Denmark is a member of the Bern Convention, in its instrument of ratification it made a declaration stating that the Convention does not apply to Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Accordingly, the Commission has unfortunately limited possibilities to intervene directly in this case. The Commission will, however, look into the best possible ways to raise this sensitive issue with the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>At international level whales are protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) which is an international organisation for the conservation and management of whales. Unfortunately, however, the hunting of pilot whales is not regulated by the IWC, as to date there is no agreement about the IWC's competence for small cetaceans. In the context of the ongoing debate about the future of the IWC, the Commission does hope, however, that the EU together with other parties to the IWC will be able to also address the issue of small cetaceans. For the purpose of having a coordinated EU position at the meetings of the IWC, on 6 November 2008 the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>When a consumer orders, from another Member State, alcohol which is dispatched or transported to the consumer in the country of destination by the vendor or on his behalf, then distance selling has occurred. In distance selling, VAT is always levied on the sale of alcohol in the country of destination, irrespective of the country of sale. Where there is a transaction involving delivery to the consumer, the delivery of the alcohol is deemed to take place in the country of destination.</p>
<p>Teleshopping occurs when the consumer himself, rather than the vendor, organises the transport of the goods from the country of origin to the country of destination. In teleshopping, the sale of alcohol is always subject to VAT in the country of origin. The place of delivery of the alcohol is the place where the product begins its journey.</p>
<p>Can a supplier offering consumers alcohol teleshopping services on the Internet publish advertisements on his own website for a third party’s transport services without his activity being regarded as distance selling?

In such a situation, the economic reality should be taken into account and the transaction could be re-qualified and treated, for VAT purposes, as a supply of goods subject to excise duty transported by or on behalf of the vendor, taxable in the Member State where the transport to the consumers ends.

In this context, it should be mentioned that, according to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, unacceptable detention conditions also can constitute a violation of Article 3 (prohibition of torture) of the ECHR even where there is no evidence that there was a positive intention of humiliation or debasing a detainee.

In my home country, Sweden, subsidies were particularly made available for shipyards, none of which now remain in the country at all.

<p>(EN) Article 295 of the EC Treaty stipulates that “the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership” shall not be prejudiced by the Treaty. This principle means that the Treaty does not favour private or public ownership of a company. The implementation of such a principle presupposes that public entities which are shareholders or responsible for the operating of a company act in a way similar to that of private actors. As has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice (in case C-174/04, Commission v Italy, §32): "Treaty provisions on the free movement of capital do not draw a distinction between private undertakings and public undertakings".</p>
<p>Indeed, especially in its application of state aid rules, the Commission distinguishes cases in which public entities act as private actors, and those in which public ownership or public intervention in the ownership or management of a company are justified by public or other State considerations. This distinction is implemented through the application of the so-called “market economy investor principle”. According to that principle, behaviour of a public shareholder or public operator is compared with what a private operator based on market economy considerations only would have done in the same situation: this implies that the rationale for such a public investment, its conditions and its remuneration are examined. If the public intervention does not stand up to the market economy investor test, then the Commission considers that this intervention contains state aid elements, the compatibility of which with the common market has to be assessed.</p>
<p>Therefore, under Community law and in compliance with the market economy investor principle, nationalisation or partial public investment in companies (independent of the sector) as such is in principle not prohibited. However, in cases in which State interventions fail to meet the market economy investor test, these measures have to be examined by the Commission in order to assess their compatibility with state aid rules.</p>
<p>In the current financial and economic crisis, it seems difficult to reconcile public interventions in order to support failing companies or firms in a sector facing difficult times ahead, with a market economy investor behaviour. From that point of view, potential public investment in e.g. Volvo or Saab (though these projects seem to have been abandoned) would indeed need to be assessed carefully as for their compliance with state aid rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0953"></a>

<p>(EN) On 23.10.2008<a href="#defann_69_3" name="refann_69_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the European Court of Justice (ECJ) confirmed that Greece failed to fulfil its obligations under Directive 89/48/EEC<a href="#defann_69_4" name="refann_69_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> because it did not recognise the diplomas awarded by the competent authorities of other Member States following education and training provided by a private body in Greece on the basis of a franchise agreement. The Court added that this conclusion does not call into question the responsibility of Greece for the content of teaching and the organisation of the education system. Since however the diplomas in question were awarded by the competent authorities of other Member States solely in the light of the applicable rules within the framework of their respective education and training systems, diplomas awarded on completion of education and training provided within the framework of homologation (franchise) agreements do not fall, in the context of Directive 89/48/EEC, within the Greek education system. By this ruling the ECJ confirms its earlier ruling in the case Neri<a href="#defann_69_5" name="refann_69_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> against Italy of 2003 in which it had clarified that the refusal to recognise a qualification delivered through a franchise agreement for the only reason that education was not delivered on university premises was contrary to Community law.</p>
<p>These two judgments, one directly and one indirectly, establish that Greece's legislation is not in line with Community law when Directive 89/48/EEC was still in force.

It needs to be stressed that Article 53 of this Directive gives Member States expressly the right to verify a number of elements linked to ie. franchise diplomas, such as the formal validity of the certification of training courses followed in another Member State by the Member State of origin, the identity of the diploma with one which was awarded after a course has been followed entirely in the Member State of origin or the identity of the professional rights conferred.</p>
<p>On 4.12.2008 the ECJ rendered two new judgments<a href="#defann_69_7" name="refann_69_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> against Greece by which he expressly confirmed the conclusions of C-274/05 and ruled that Greece infringed EU law by not recognising franchise diplomas.</p>
<p>The most recent jurisprudence of the ECJ and the secondary legislation at EU level on the recognition of professional qualifications, Directive 2005/36/EC, clearly establish the framework of how Greece should deal with franchise diplomas obtained by qualified professionals. There is no legal uncertainty and therefore no need for a new proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As stated by the Honourable Member, the Commission has indeed announced a Recovery Plan for growth and jobs, to boost demand and restore confidence in the European economy. Within this context, the Commission is considering to propose Member States to grant additional State aid measures, applicable only for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>Among the envisaged measures, the Commission could allow Member States to grant aid in the form of guarantees and subsidised loans. Of course, the approval of these measures will be subject to certain conditions and maximum amounts and should be discussed with Member States. These initiatives are not targeted to one specific sector of the economy but aim at helping businesses to overcome difficulties in obtaining financing resulting directly from the recent crisis.</p>
<p>It is important to recall that since the beginning of the crisis, the Council has emphasised the need to maintain the application of competition rules. The Commission must ensure a level playing field for European companies, avoiding subsidy races between Member States, which would be non-sustainable and detrimental to the EU as a whole. For this reason the Commission is prudent as regards any possible "flexible application" of the State aid rules. The current State aid framework already provides a significant number of possibilities for granting State aid to all sectors, including the car industry.</p>
<p>On the supply side, the R&amp;D&amp;I framework allows State aid for the development of green technologies, provided that there is a market failure and that the aid has an incentive effect and is proportionate. Environmental aid is also available for companies improving Community environmental standards on their production process. In addition, other rules are available to address problems faced by SMEs further down the supply chains. In particular, the General Block Exemption Regulation provides a wide panoply of aid measures with minimal administrative burden.</p>
<p>Subsidised guarantees may help to address some of the car industry's problems, as well as problems faced by their suppliers. However, once a company gets into a situation where not even a subsidised guarantee will be available to it, the rescue and restructuring rules might become applicable. Therefore, at this stage, the Commission does not see the need to draw up a specific sectoral framework for the car industry.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that loans granted to car industries by the European Investment Bank are non subsidised loans since they are provided at market price.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0957"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission may propose legislation in relation to financial markets. However, responsibility for implementation and effective enforcement rests with Member State regulators (and at the global level, with third country financial regulators.)</p>
<p>Right from the start of the financial crisis over a year ago, the Commission has acted with Member States to ameliorate the situation and propose longer term remedies as appropriate. In recent months, the Commission has tabled proposals amending the Capital Requirements Directive, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive and rules on fair value accounting. The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. Moreover, the Commission has commissioned work on executive pay and derivatives, and is releasing a consultation paper on hedge funds. Moreover, a High Level Group of experts under Jacques de Larosière has been tasked with coming forward with recommendations on, inter alia, cross-border supervision. Finally, the Commission has announced a paper on the future of financial market regulation for Summer 2009.</p>
<p>As regards the specific questions on capital, minimum equity and leverage ratios, these are being debated in different fora. The Commission is actively involved in the Basel II work on these issues, and is also monitoring developments in the markets to determine the appropriate way forward. In this context, the issues raised by the Honourable Member will be looked at in detail. However, it would appear premature to give concrete signals in any particular direction at this point in time.</p>
<p>As laid out above, the Commission has tabled a large number of proposals this year and expects this pace of work to continue over the next months.</p>
<p>This is a brief summary of what the Commission has been working on in this field. The Commission is of course available for further information if so wished by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0960"></a>

<p>(EN) The double-checking surveillance system was foreseen to end on 31 December 2008 in the Community legislation and was not foreseen to last beyond that date.</p>
<p>As the Commission has already explained to the Honourable Member in reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0866_EN.html">H-0866/08</a><a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, there has been a "variety of requests ranging from single checking surveillance to simple customs monitoring, with most Member States expressing themselves on the different options." However, there has been no formal vote because there was no formal proposal to continue the double-checking surveillance. Therefore there has been no formal position of the Member States. This reflects the situation that the majority of the stakeholders see no reason for further action; they wish to move on to dealing with the textile sector as other sectors.</p>
<p>Moreover, China has made it clear that it "does not wish to continue the double checking surveillance system". This would make any attempt to continue doomed to fail.</p>
<p>As for any other measure to monitor textiles imports from China, no other measures were put forward formally as the general majority consensus in the discussions pointed to a liberalisation of the trade in the sector. The Commission will however, as per its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0866_EN.html">H-0866/08</a>, continue to follow closely the evolution of the actual trade statistics (Comext) and the customs data in 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the employment situation in the various sectors of the EU economy and in the textile sector in particular. This was already detailed in the Commission's reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0866_EN.html">H-0866/08</a>. Since the beginning of 2007, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has been created to fund active labour market policy measures supporting workers made redundant as a result of globalisation.

On the other hand, it is evident that much remains to be done on the side of our partner countries, especially in the areas of governance and rule of law.</p>

<p>The EU follows a policy of individual differentiation to target our support to the individual needs and aspirations of partners, offering more to those countries that are more committed and make greater progress on reform (“more for more”). On this basis, the Commission identified four countries with which the intensity of cooperation warrants closer relations with the EU: Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco and Israel. The Union is in the process of fleshing out these "advanced" relations.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully recognises the gravity of poaching and illegal wildlife trade, and the serious impact that these illegal activities can have on the conservation status of species. The Commission's concerns in that regard are reflected in the Directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law, which was formally adopted by the Parliament and the Council on 19 November 2008 (Directive 2008/99/EC). This Directive will ensure that the illegal harvesting and trade in protected species are a criminal offence and are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.</p>
<p>As regards international wildlife trade, in its Recommendation of 13 June 2007 identifying a set of actions for the enforcement of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission recommends, inter alia, that Member States should liaise with and support third countries as well as international organisations, such as the UNEP CITES Secretariat, WCO and Interpol, in order to help detect, deter and prevent illegal wildlife trade. Although the Commission has not provided direct funding to WCO and Interpol for combating environmental and wildlife crime, it works closely with these organisations and invites them to the regular meetings of the EU Wildlife Trade Enforcement Group in order to ensure effective cooperation and coordination on wildlife trade crime.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has provided funding through the CITES Secretariat for the organisation of an Asian CITES implementation and enforcement workshop in China in 2005, which addressed enforcement issues and regional cooperation in combating illegal trade in tiger products and other threatened species. The Commission has also providing funding to the CITES Secretariat this year for a tiger trade enforcement meeting due to take place in 2009.</p>
<p>In the framework of its international cooperation activities on environment and development, the Commission is also funding a number of programs and projects at global, regional or local scale aiming at fostering the sustainable management of biodiversity and/or protected areas. Most of these programs include anti-poaching measures and support to law enforcement. Examples of these in the Asian region are the establishment of the Pamir-Alai trans-boundary conservancy area (PATCA) between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan and the EU-China Biodiversity Program (ECBP).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
