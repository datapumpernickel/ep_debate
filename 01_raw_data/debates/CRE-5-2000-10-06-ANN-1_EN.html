What criteria have been identified to assess ‘quality’ in programming? How will results be disseminated? Will the Commission clarify these details in a written statement to Parliament?

<p>The Communication of 16 May 2000 on the reform of the Community's External Assistance identified the establishment of an Interdepartmental Quality Support Group (QSGI) as one of the main actions to improve the consistency and quality of programming.</p>
<p>The mandate of the QSGI was adopted by the Commission in July 2000 and the personal representatives of the Commissioners have now been nominated. The first meeting of the QSGI is taking place this week.</p>
<p>The establishment of the QSGI was one of the top priorities in the implementation of the reform of external assistance. There has been a short delay compared to the initial calendar to make sure that the best people were appointed as the personal representatives of the Commissioners. In no way does this short delay, however, question the Commission's commitment to development policy priorities.</p>
<p>One of the very first tasks of the QSGI will be to define the substance and methodology for an enhanced system of multiannual aid programming by country and by region. This methodology will, inter alia, assess whether the analysis of six common elements contained in the Framework for Country Strategy Papers has been carried out in a thorough way and is relevant to and consistent with the proposed strategy. The Framework should be adopted at one of the next General Affairs Councils (GAC) or Development Councils, after fruitful coordination between the Commission and the Member States. Furthermore, the QSGI will examine the usual four criteria of pertinence, feasbility, viability and impact for programming documents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0785"></a>

<p>The December 1995 "Memorandum of Understanding on the closure of Chernobyl by 2000" between the G7 and the Ukraine includes a number of commitments for both sides. In particular, these require the Ukraine definitively to close the Chernobyl plant in 2000. The Commission welcomes the recent confirmation that this will happen by 15 December this year. In the discussions with the Ukrainian authorities the Commission will continue to press for improved levels of nuclear safety throughout the country and for reform of the energy sector more generally. In this context there is also included in the Memorandum a point related to the energy investment programme. This programme is intended to identify least-cost power supply investments to meet Ukraine's future national power requirements. Besides the completion of the Khmeltnisky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear plants other non-nuclear projects are also included, like thermal and hydro plants rehabilitation and pumped storage projects.</p>
<p>Licensing of nuclear installations within Member States is the responsibility of national safety authorities. Under Chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty, the Community is responsible for ensuring the protection of the health of the general public as well as of workers in the nuclear industry. In this context, the Commission has issued several Directives and Regulations, in addition to the specific provisions on environmental protection laid down in the Treaty itself. These competences do not directly relate to nuclear safety of the installations, but do address the possible consequences of an emergency, including on the territory of other Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0711"></a>

<p>A 12 km section of the planned Guersac-Pontchâteau very high voltage (225 000 volts) power line will cross the Brière Regional Park, an area of special plant and animal interest (French acronym: ZNIEFF), a bird conservation area (ZICO) and land which is being considered for classification as a special conservation area (ZSC).</p>
<p>This project will disfigure the Brivet valley and will inevitably have an adverse impact on its fauna and flora. As the body responsible for safeguarding the importance of the Brière Regional Park in terms of its environment, landscape and as a tourist centre, and without calling into question the advisability and economic value of the project, the Pays de la Loire Regional Council has urged that the power line should be built using innovative, alternative technological procedures which reflect the concerns of the various authorities involved in running the park, with a view to making an effective contribution to its sustainable development.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully committed to Agenda 21 and supports its implementation. Europe showed leadership at the 1992 Rio summit, at its 5-year review, and intends to make a substantial contribution to Rio+10. The EC Treaty identifies sustainable development as an objective that permeates and guides Community policies, and the Fifth Environmental Action Programme “Towards Sustainability” was a reflection of Agenda 21 at European level.</p>
<p>Although the Community has developed a number of innovative policies and activities to implement Agenda 21, it is not easy to point out all the specific measures undertaken in relation to promoting Agenda 21 in the Community. These include, inter alia:</p>
<p>- The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund promote a more balanced socio-economic development in the Community. The Funds are increasingly drawn on for environmental improvement projects, to clean up polluted areas, to promote environmentally friendly agriculture, and to provide support for conservation, public transport and environmental management training. Recent reforms mean that environmental concerns must now be addressed systematically in all programming and evaluations.</p>
<p>- LIFE is the financial instrument supporting Community environmental policy. It co-finances actions both in nature conservation and in other environmental fields, both within the Community and outside it. For additional information, please refer to </p>
<p>- The Commission also has other mechanisms to finance sustainability within the Community, including information and awareness. For further information, please see</p>
<p> In addition, the Commission contributes a substantial amount to NGO activities in line with the objectives set out in Agenda 21, also with regard to public awareness raising.</p>
<p>At the global level, the Community is a major aid donor: together, the Community and its Member States provide more than half of all development aid. Environment and, more generally, sustainable development concerns, have become a priority in development cooperation policy. Sustainable development provisions have been built into programmes financed under the Lomé and the new Cotonou Conventions, cooperation with Asian and Latin American States (ALA), the Mediterranean, and the Phare and Tacis programmes. In addition, there are specific budget lines for NGO cooperation and for supporting environment and tropical forest projects in developing countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0732"></a>

The two FAO experts said that industrial fishing vessels did not comply with the periods laid down for fishing and were exploiting maritime resources in such a way as to drive certain species of fish to extinction. Moreover, by failing to adjust to the Mediterranean ecosystem, industrial fishing had interfered with species' reproductive cycles.</p>

<p>In order to correctly assess the case reported by the honourable Member, we should mention the principles of the Schengen Agreement with regard to the crossing of internal borders:</p>
<p>- Article 2(1) of the Schengen Convention stipulates, “Internal borders may be crossed at any point without any checks on persons being carried out.” According to a decision by the Executive Committee in 1994, that means that all travellers, whatever their nationality, are exempt from checking carried out by border police on the grounds that they are crossing a border. Since 26 March 2000, this has also been applicable to passengers on flights between Greece and Germany.</p>
<p>- The terms of Article 2(2) authorise a Contracting Party, subject to public order or national security requirements, to reintroduce border checks appropriate to the situation for a limited period. In principle, if this safeguard clause is implemented, it should be initiated through a consultation procedure. According to the information available to the Commission, Article 2(2) was not implemented by the German authorities at the internal borders mentioned in the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>- Article 2(3) of the Schengen Convention stipulates, “The abolition of checks on persons at internal borders shall not affect … the exercise of police powers by the competent authorities under each Contracting Party's legislation throughout its territory.”</p>
<p>Internal borders and the bordering area are not therefore a proscribed area where no checks may be carried out.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Executive Committee’s decision, however, substitute border checks are incompatible with the terms of the Schengen Convention on the elimination of checks. Substitute checks are understood here to be systematic checks carried out on people on the grounds that they have crossed a border in an area in close proximity to the border or in determined border areas. As far as the Commission is concerned, it is clear that this principle defined by the Executive Committee regarding internal land borders is also, by analogy, applicable to airports.</p>
<p>All these Schengen instruments have been integrated into the European Union framework, and the Council has determined the legal basis for these in the first pillar. Monitoring the implementation of Article 2 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement is therefore carried out according to the principles governing the monitoring of the application of Community legislation.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission does not have sufficient information regarding the reasons why, and the conditions in which, the checks at Munich airport reported by the honourable Member were carried out, which would make it possible to determine whether these checks were “substitute border checks” or general police checks of the type which may be carried out throughout the territory. The Commission cannot, consequently, give an immediate opinion as to whether these checks are concordant with the above-mentioned principles or not.</p>

<p>The first article of the regulation on the creation of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) stipulates that the objective of the Monitoring Centre is to provide the Community and its Member States with ‘objective, reliable and comparable data’ at the European level on drugs and drug addiction, and the consequences thereof. This objective has not, however, been achieved in full and efforts still need to be made in order to make a genuine comparison between the situations in the various Member States possible.</p>
<p>The European Union Action Plan on Drugs 2000–2004, which was endorsed by the Santa Maria Da Feira European Council, stipulates that the Monitoring Centre must, by the end of the year 2000, complete its work on the five epidemiological indicators and also the indicators for drugs-related crime, the availability of illegal drugs and social exclusion related to drugs, and shall present an annual report to the Council’s Horizontal Group on Drugs on the convergence of the main indicators, the progress made in this area and proposed actions for the following year intended to resolve any outstanding problems.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Centre made a commitment to submit to its Management Board by January 2001 a report on its views on the criteria and definitions to be used to implement the key five epidemiological indicators at national level, thereby making it possible to overcome the omissions in definitions and methodologies. The implementation of these criteria by the Member States will make it possible to carry out the necessary harmonisation to be able to carry out a comparison of epidemiological statistics on drugs between Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that genuine progress has been made by the Monitoring Centre in meeting the requirements established by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0741"></a>

<p>On 11 September 2000 the Greek Ministries of Agriculture and of the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works announced the measures to be taken concerning genetically modified cotton which has been illegally imported into and cultivated in Greece. As part of these measures the Ministry of Agriculture has arbitrarily set the contamination level of the seeds at 1% and decided that the crop of fields sown with less than 1% of the genetically modified product need not be destroyed, while in the case of fields in which the degree of contamination of the seeds is above 1% the cotton should be ginned in separate ginning plants and exported. These measures are in breach of Council Directive 90/220/EEC<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and pre-empt a final decision by the Community institutions. It should also be pointed out that by this announcement the two ministries in question are violating undertakings to destroy crops of genetically modified cotton which account for 6% of the total seeds on the Greek market.</p>

<p>To date, no genetically modified (GM) cotton varieties have received authorisation for placing on the market under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC although two varieties are currently pending approval.</p>
<p>Seed of conventional varieties of cotton has been found in Greece to contain impurities of GM seeds. The Greek authorities sampled 14,000 tonnes of seed and examined 3,000 samples. They found that 560 hectares were planted with seeds with GM impurities higher than 1 %.</p>
<p>In a press release of 11 September 2000 the Greek Government stated that:</p>
<p>the harvesting of the area will take place separately,</p>
<p>the product of the harvest will go to two selected ginning (processing) industries,</p>
<p>the cotton fibre will be separated from the kernels,</p>
<p>the kernels will be destroyed (approximately 1,000 tonnes) and farmers will be compensated for the loss of income (a total of 25 million Greek drachmas).</p>
<p>the fibres will be exported, although there is no way to find out whether or not they derive from GM plants( the "raw" cotton fibre is an elongated single cell containing a dead nucleus – so there is no chance to identify the DNA).</p>
<p>Inspection and control measures to ensure compliance with the Directive 90/220/EEC lie with Member States and the question concerning financial compensation of the farmers concerned should also be addressed by the national administrative body and legal system.</p>
<p>As indicated in position 75 of the Annex to the Commission’s White Paper on Food Safety, the Commission has the intention to adopt, under the existing Community seed legislation, standards for purity concerning the adventitious presence of genetically modified seeds as well specific labelling requirements for seeds in respect of genetically modified material.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Just a few weeks after taking office, the new Commission wished to indicate its determination to continue the Commission’s action in favour of the outermost regions.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission organised a partnership meeting on 23 November 1999 bringing together Members of the European Parliament from these regions, the representatives of Member States, regional and local authorities, the Commission President and several other Commissioners and Commission departments.</p>
<p>This event enabled the Member States to present the broad guidelines of their memoranda, and gave the various participants the opportunity to draw the Commission’s attention to any particularly sensitive areas or to their priorities. The purpose of this day’s event was to initiate constructive dialogue with a view to preparing the Commission’s report on the implementation of the new Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty. At this time, the Commission did not make an express agreement to draw up practical measures to adapt the milk quota system to the Autonomous Region of the Azores, as the honourable Member claims.</p>
<p>This report was adopted on 14 March 2000, and does not contain any specific reference to the Azores milk quota system. It should be noted that, neither in the memorandum on implementation of the new Article 299(2) nor in its requests for revision of POSEIMA, did Portugal include any specific request regarding the Azores milk quota.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April 2000, the Portuguese authorities informed the Commission of a problem involving exceeding the milk quota in the Azores. This is an important and problematic issue, in view of the Community regulations on milk quotas.

<p>The Commission is well aware of the potential difficulties of lack of accessibility faced by certain islands and peripheral regions. For this reason, in the case of Ireland, programmes to improve transport links have from the beginning featured prominently in the Community’s interventions under both the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</p>
<p>In the period of the first two Community Support Frameworks, from 1989 to 1999, actions to reduce the impact of peripherality covered almost every aspect of transport infrastructure : the upgrading of strategic road corridors and main railways, the development of regional airport and port infrastructure and improving traffic management. In total, more than &#x80;1700 million have been spent under the Structural Funds on transport-related activities during the period.</p>
<p>Between 1993 and 1999, this has been supplemented by actions under the Cohesion Fund, where approximately &#x80;million, amounting to half the available resources, have been devoted to the development of the trans-European road and rail networks, including major projects to improve port and airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>For the current programming period, running to 2006, an Operational Programme for Economic and Social Infrastructure will devote some &#x80; 530 million from the Structural Funds to transport infrastructure investment. A particular feature of the proposals is the commitment to upgrade the main inter-urban road network to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard by the end of the programming period.</p>
<p>Under the separate Regional Operational Programmes, there will also be contributions from the Structural Funds for the development of local roads, while national resources will be freed for the development of ports and regional airports. In addition, expenditure on transport of some &#x80;280 million will be provided from the Cohesion Fund in the period up to 2003.</p>
<p>These actions, which form part of an overall programme of investment in transport infrastructure in Ireland of some &#x80;10 billion over the programming period, underline the continuing commitment of the national authorities and the Community to improving mobility within the country and its accessibility to the rest of the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0750"></a>

<p>On 15 September 2000 in Brussels, the Commission President met with the President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang. According to many reports, notably those drawn up by the United Nations, Equatorial Guinea continues to be governed by an autocratic regime under which human rights are systematically violated. Mr Obiang has thus failed to comply with any of the undertakings given to the international community, including the EU, concerning democratisation of the country.</p>
<p>In the light of this situation, what was the substance of the discussions between Mr Prodi and Mr Obiang? What demands did the Commission issue concerning respect for human rights and democracy? What undertakings did Mr Obiang give? Was his attention drawn to the democratic clauses included in agreements between the EU and Equatorial Guinea?

<p>The meeting between the Commission President and President Obiang took place in the context of the political dialogue which the Commission has with the ACP countries that signed the Lomé Convention IV and the Cotonou partnership agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission called upon President Obiang to comply strictly with the recommendations given in Resolution 2000/19 of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights. In particular, the Commission stressed that the technical assistance schemes in support of civil society and promoting the rule of law and good governance should be backed up by the monitoring activities to be carried out by the Special Representative of the Commission for Human Rights and by the United Nations’ special rapporteurs.</p>
<p>President Obiang put forward a national plan for governance subdivided into four sub-sections (executive power, legislative power, judicial power and human rights). This represents a firm official commitment by the government in these areas.</p>
<p>In discussion, the fundamental principles contained in Article 5 of the Lomé Convention IV a and in the Cotonou agreement were brought to the attention of President Obiang.</p>
<p>An initial Community investigation mission was carried out in 1998 and a report was issued. A joint EU/Inter-Parliamentary Union mission is currently in the country examining a programme in support of civil society and promoting the rule of law and good governance. This mission’s report will be available by November 2000 at the earliest.</p>
<p>The Commission pointed out to President Obiang that, as can be observed in other countries, the discovery and exploitation of petroleum resources are not necessarily linked into the country’s social development: the Commission will therefore assess the country’s development on the basis of the results achieved in the social sectors and, given that the level of available resources has increased in the meantime, expectations regarding results will also have increased.</p>
<p>Public finances nonetheless remain one of the weakest links in the administration of Equatorial Guinea, which suffers from a chronic lack of human and, at least thus far, financial resources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0754"></a>

<p>Since 1994, with a view to providing support for adjustments in fisheries and the restructuring of the fisheries sector, the Commission has had at its disposal a wide range of socio-economic measures to support employment:</p>
<p>- through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), productive investment leading to the creation of jobs and diversification of activities has been encouraged in areas dependent on fisheries (ADFs), in particular in ADFs in Objective 1 areas, which include the peripheral least developed areas;</p>
<p>- the European Social Fund (ESF) finances training courses for fishermen designed to improve their qualifications (new technologies, on-board safety, the environment, etc.);</p>
<p>- the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) supports job-creating investment in processing and aquaculture, co-finances national early-retirement aid schemes and grants a premium for the definitive cessation of fishing.</p>
<p>FIFG employment support was strengthened in 1999 by three new measures: (a) a premium for diversification or conversion of activities outside offshore fishing; (b) a premium for young fishermen (below age 35) wishing to purchase their first (second-hand) vessel; and (c) aid for vocational training (as part of collective actions).</p>

<p>The rate of unemployment in the Community averaged 9.2% in 1999, the third year in succession that the rate has fallen, down from 10.8% in 1996. The rate declined further to 8.5% by July 2000, and is expected to reach 8% by the end of the current year. 14.3 million people are presently out of work in the Community, down from the peak of 18.7 million in February 1994.</p>
<p>Since 1997 in particular, the fall in unemployment has been gaining momentum, reflecting an improved economic situation as well as the impact of reforms in labour markets, driven by the European employment strategy. However, the wide disparities in unemployment between Member States and regions, as well as between genders and age groups, are still a reason for concern. Equally, long-term unemployment, albeit down to 4.2% from 5.3% in 1996, is still high and affects nearly half of the unemployed. This situation calls for continued efforts to raise skills and increase job opportunities for the unemployed, in particular by adopting a more preventative approach, as recommended in the employment guidelines.</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is especially serious among disabled people, although no precise measurement is possible, for lack of data. To focus policy efforts more sharply and create more opportunities for the disabled, the Commission has proposed in the new Guidelines for 2001, that Member States set targets for the implementation of appropriate measures to meet the needs of disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Increased emphasis has also been placed on combating discrimination and promoting social inclusion by access to employment, education and training. Finally, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to the directive for equal treatment in employment, based on Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which, it is hoped, will be adopted in October.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0760"></a>

<p>When speaking about drought in the Horn of Africa, one should put this phenomenon in a certain perspective, as drought in this part of the world is a recurrent event, known for centuries. It has to be feared that this will continue. Recently, however, these droughts have become exacerbated by meteorological phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña. In fact La Niña seems to be at the origin of the more than abundant rains which fell earlier this year in southern Africa while at the same time provoking a prolonged drought in the Horn.</p>
<p>The latest recorded famine in Ethiopia took place in the eighties when the Mengistu regime initially denied the existence of a drought. The international community could thus only intervene after considerable delays. In the meantime techniques to detect drought have improved considerably. Satellite images allow us to estimate, at regular intervals, rainfall received in certain areas and to see the development of the vegetation cover. In this context I am pleased to inform that the Commission finances a global FAO Programme entitled “Système mondial d’ information et d’alerte rapide”. On the local, Ethiopian level, the Commission works very closely with USAID in the production and analysis of bi-weekly satellite images.</p>
<p>The Commission also finances RESAL, the “Réseau Européen de Securité Alimentaire”. RESAL makes analyses of all incoming information related to food security in order to guide the Commission better in matters of food aid and food security. It produces for example statistical data on grain market prices within Ethiopia thus allowing us to detect when market distortions appear. The Community is currently also financing a major expansion of the National Meteorological Services network in Ethiopia. The Commission has a local Food Security Unit in Addis, like in many Sahel countries. This Unit is following the food security situation in Ethiopia very closely, carrying out a multitude of activities ranging from grain production estimates to follow up on NGO interventions.</p>
<p>The drought of 2000 was an extension of similar but less severe droughts in 1999 and 1998. In conformity with normal nomadic practice, herders left their usual place of living in search for water and grazing for their animals. However due to insecurity, travel of expatriate staff of all aid agencies had to be discontinued. Regular monitoring of the nutrition status of the nomadic population became thus very difficult.</p>
<p>Food shortages in the Horn of Africa are frequent in Eritrea, Somalia and parts of Sudan and Kenya while chronic in Ethiopia. This chronic food deficit in Ethiopia is due to a structural deficit in food production, recurrent drought as well as socio-political and economic factors. As problems in Ethiopia are more of a structural nature than elsewhere, the Commission has, over the years, been paying considerable attention to the long-term perspective of the food situation in Ethiopia and a policy of food security rather than food aid has been pursued.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0761"></a>

<p>At the beginning of September a cargo ship, EUROBULKER X, flying a Cambodian flag was cut in two in a harbour in the Gulf of Evvia: one person lost his life and substantial material damage was caused. In April of the same year, according to Eauqsis, this vessel had been banned from leaving harbour because serious problems had arisen concerning the strength of the ship's walls.

<p>In accordance with Council Directive 95/21/EC on Port State Control (PSC), the inspection of foreign flagged vessels by the port State consists of a document check and a general examination of the overall condition of the ship. This examination may be extended, in breadth and depth, if clear grounds are established to question the vessel's compliance with the international safety standards.</p>
<p>When deficiencies found are clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment the ship must be detained. The detention order can be lifted only when the hazard is removed.</p>
<p>This means that, notwithstanding the certification issued by or on behalf of the flag State, when there are clear grounds to believe that a vessel does not comply with the applicable requirements, the port State is authorised to take action to ensure that the vessel does not sail until it can do so without danger.</p>
<p>The inspections by the state where ports are located are rightly considered as a fundamental tool to reduce substandard shipping. The Commission action in this field continues to be rigorous. It should be noted that the package of legislative proposals adopted in March with the "Communication on the Safety of Seaborne Oil Trade", foresees a general strengthening of the PSC inspection regime. In particular, the possibility is also proposed to ban from European waters certain vessels which, on the basis of the number of their detentions, are considered to represent a high level of risk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>For the budget for the year 2000, on 26 September, the Commission committed a total of EUR 22 150 725 for Greek Cohesion Fund projects, including EUR 14 231 115 for Transport projects and EUR 7 919 610 for Environment projects. The total anticipated for Greek projects for this same year has been increased from 16 to 18% of EUR 2 659 billion, or EUR 452.03 million, to be divided equally between the ‘transport’ and ‘environment’ projects.</p>
<p>As of 26 September 2000, the situation is as follows for the four countries in receipt of Cohesion Fund monies:</p>
<p>Ireland: EUR 106 billion available, EUR 0.03 billion committed, i.e. 0.0% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Greece: EUR 452 billion available, EUR 22.15 billion committed, i.e. 4.9% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Spain: EUR 1 649 billion available, EUR 432.7 billion committed, i.e. 26.2% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Portugal: EUR 452 billion available, EUR 11.9 billion committed, i.e. 2.6% take-up of appropriations.</p>
<p>A commitment of EUR 1.573.531 has been made for technical assistance.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for the lack of projects which the Commission has received to date. Firstly, following the efforts made to commit appropriations fully by the end of 1999, there were very few requests outstanding at the beginning of the current financial year for funding for new projects. Secondly, in this, the first year of the new programming period, the Member Sates have focused particularly on Objective 1 programming.</p>
<p>The Commission processes the applications for assistance put in by Member States and, after examining them, proposes to adopt them by initially committing the corresponding appropriations. According to the financial regulation, deferment of appropriations may be considered for projects in which the interdepartmental consultation has been completed by the end of the year 2000, with the agreement of the departments concerned. Such deferment of appropriations may be considered for the appropriations corresponding to these projects on condition that they have already been committed prior to 31 March 2001.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission has already approached the Greek authorities in order to encourage them to present their Cohesion Fund projects as early as possible given that, at this stage, the number of projects received is not such as to ensure satisfactory execution of the same. The fact is, if the Member States involved in the Cohesion Fund do not submit an adequate number of projects, there is a risk that some of the appropriations included in the budget for the Cohesion Fund for the year 2000 may be irretrievably lost for the 2000-2006 period covered by the Interinistitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission will redouble its efforts and will continue to liase with the competent Member State authorities in order to ensure the maximum take-up of appropriations by the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0767"></a>

<p>Over the last few years the European shipbuilding industry has faced very serious problems, having lost a very large share of the market. The situation is progressively deteriorating, since a very large portion of vessels today are built by the Japanese and South Korean shipbuilding industries which receive significant orders, including many from European operators. The grave crisis affecting the traditional shipbuilding sector, especially in southern Europe, has led to the suspension of activities at many plants, making hundreds of thousands of persons unemployed.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the Community policies implemented during all these years are chiefly responsible for the slump in, and destruction of, the production capacity of European shipbuilding industry, will the Commission say whether it draws any conclusions from these policies and their consequences? Does it intend to promote specific measures to support and strengthen the European shipbuilding and repair sector, bearing in mind that it is promoting a series of directives will generate increased demand in this sector (double hull tankers, etc.)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission fully recognises the importance of the European shipbuilding industry. It is also aware of the particular difficulties faced by many yards. However, it is not the policies of the Commission towards the sector that are the cause of those difficulties. The main causes are the difficult situation on the world shipbuilding market and the problems caused by unfair competition practices.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the 18 May 2000 Industry Council sent a strong signal that the Community will not tolerate such practices. In that context the Commission has been working hard to find a satisfactory solution within the framework of bilateral talks with Korea. It is communicating the results of the consultations held on 28/29 September to the Article 133 Committee. It will also be reporting on the outcome within the context of a further market monitoring report to be submitted to the December Industry Council, which will review the situation.</p>
<p>So far as measures to improve the safety of ships is concerned, the Commission’s recent proposals, if adopted, will help to stimulate demand for new tankers.

<p>The Commission has already indicated that it regarded as broadly pertinent the action plan set out in its 1997 communication seeking to facilitate industrial restructuring activities and lay the foundations for a European market in defence equipment.</p>
<p>The delay that has occurred in its implementation, responsibility for which lies as much with the Commission as with the Council, has prevented confirmation of the European framework as the source of rules governing a European internal market in such products.</p>
<p>Given that situation, other initiatives, on an intergovernmental basis and smaller in scale, have been taken outside the Community framework, such as the LOI (Letter of Intent) which resulted in the signing in July 2000 of the framework agreement by the six Member States concerned (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom).</p>
<p>That framework agreement includes measures designed to facilitate industrial restructuring activities and the business activities of transnational armaments manufacturers. It forms part of the approach advocated by the Commission for the establishment of a set of harmonised rules for that sector.</p>
<p>It represents a point of departure leading towards European harmonisation which the Commission cannot but welcome. However, the issue of the involvement in the process of the other Member States, which account for a substantial proportion of the defence equipment market, remains outstanding.</p>
<p>The six Member States party to the agreement together account for 90% of the European industrial defence potential, but they do not account for 90% of the market.</p>
<p>Hence the relevance of a Community-wide market in order to create synergies and economies of scale and to stop the gap between the LOI Member States and the others becoming wider.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that one avenue worth exploring might be to seek solutions to these issues that involve all 15 Member States, since these are issues that are, of course, of interest to the Union as a whole, based to the extent necessary on the guidelines laid down by the six LOI Member States. Solutions involving all 15 Member States would enjoy the force of law derived from their status as Community acts.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission is continuing to review the measures which might lead to tangible results and, to that end, is taking into consideration the policies and measures developed in parallel which affect the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the direct dialogue between the heads of undertakings in the sector and the Commission will shortly be resumed in order to confirm the approach to be adopted and the specific measures to be taken. The appropriate contacts have already been established with a view, after in-depth preparations have been made, to convening a Round Table in early 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0773"></a>

<p>It is particularly important, in the case in point, to check with the British authorities that, prior to carrying out the necessary repairs on the “Tireless”, the legal requirements in terms of public information regarding the applicable health and safety measures in the event of a potential radiological emergency were respected, taking into account the proximity of Spanish territory (<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>).

In the case in point, the Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989 specifically stipulates provisions for informing the public about the health and safety measures applicable in the event of a radioactive emergency, taking into account close proximity with another Member State. The Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 further provides that an intervention plan in the case of a potential accident (mobilisation of the necessary resources) should be adopted and should also consider the cross border aspect that the adoption of such measures may have.</p>
<p>The mere existence of Community regulations on the subject, therefore, is of direct concern to the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. It must be added that Article No 10 of the 1989 Directive specifies unequivocally that the Commission be informed, at its request, of measures for the prior information of the population and for the information of parties that might, potentially, be required to intervene in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>These factors will lead the Commission to refer the matter to the British authorities in the coming days in order, firstly, to remind them of their obligations in that area and, secondly, to ascertain the nature of the measures adopted on the basis of the applicable Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0780"></a>

<p>According to reports, many of the areas destroyed by the recent fires in Arcadia are to be included in the Greek national land register, notably in the province of Mantinea, where the historic, exceptionally beautiful and unique fir-tree forest is to be found, famed in mythology as the home of the god Pan. The forest of Mainalo has suffered serious damage affecting its ecosystem and requires immediate renewal and reafforestation measures. Other regions ravaged by the recent fires, such as Gortinia and the mountain region of Kinouria, are also experiencing problems relating to inclusion in the land register.</p>
<p>What measures will the Commission take to protect the forest areas destroyed by fire, and ensure that reafforestation goes ahead, that no change is made in the land use and that these areas are not converted into pasture land or building land, particularly those areas included under the NATURA 2000 programme, such as the forest of Mainalo?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Many schools built in 1967 with materials containing asbestos are still in use in the province of Ilia, as are 18 schools in the province of Thessaloniki built in 1978.

The asbestos panels having suffered fatigue and cracking, spreading asbestos fibres into the environment, with serious effects on health (see Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/P-4-1999-0879_EN.html">P-0879/99</a><a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).</p>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the health risks involved in exposure to any form of asbestos and consequently considers that no effort must be spared in minimising such risks.</p>
<p>It is nonetheless up to the national authorities to ensure that the relevant legislation is implemented. Any practical instance of a possible contravention of the national provisions transposing Directive No 83/477/EEC<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> must therefore be brought to the attention of the Greek authorities responsible for inspecting and monitoring compliance with the national legislation, and they must organise and carry our the inspections and checks necessary to ensure these measures are properly implemented.</p>
<p>The Commission would not fail to take the necessary action should it receive tangible proof that the Greek authorities were not properly monitoring the implementation of the national provisions transposing Directive No 83/477/EEC.</p>
<p>As far as the co-financing of the replacement of the schools in question is concerned, the honourable Member is informed that under both the second and the third Community support framework (CSF) such expenditure has been and is eligible. However, according to the Structural Funds regulations and the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member State which decides on the selection of the projects and actions to be co-financed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
