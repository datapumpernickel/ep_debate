<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Food crisis in the Tindouf refugee camps</span></p>
<p class="contents">As a result of statements made by Radhouane Nouicer, UNHCR operations manager for North Africa and the Middle East, we learned in early September of the food crisis affecting the 155 000 Saharawi refugees in the Tindouf refugee camps. The WFP reports that if no new food aid is received, refugees will only get 11 per cent of their daily food requirements – about 231 kilocalories per person – in October, compared with the standard ration of flour, pulses, beans, vegetable oil and other products, providing a daily total of 2 100 kilocalories.</p>
<p class="contents">The children are in an especially serious position, since according to UNHCR data 35% of them are suffering from chronic malnutrition and 13% from rickets.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the Commission has limited resources at its disposal, but is it able to make an immediate contribution in order to alleviate this impending food crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">What mechanisms could the Commission use to encourage the Member States to make fresh contributions to the WFP?</p>

This is also why we are providing continued assistance to the Saharawi refugees. ECHO is the largest source of aid to these refugees. Over the last three years, ECHO has more or less doubled its assistance to the Saharawi refugees from about EUR 7.5 million in 1999 to EUR 14.34 million this year.</p>
<p class="contents">While the World Food Programme is responsible for the basic foodstuffs ECHO is concentrating its assistance on supplementary food products in order to ensure a more varied diet. However, in view of the problems the World Food Programme has had in finding the donors it needs to meet its commitments ECHO decided, in 2001, to set up a three-month buffer stock of basic products such as cereals, pulses, oil and sugar, which the WFP can use in case its supplies arrive too late for distribution to the refugees, the condition being that the World Food Programme should undertake to replenish these buffer stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">This arrangement has been invaluable, with 13 such loans totalling a volume of 12 153 tonnes in the period until the end of October 2002. The problem is that so far only 5 589 tonnes have been replenished, leaving the buffer stocks very low, at a level of 17.24% of the full amount.</p>
<p class="contents">It was against this background that, at the beginning of September 2002, the World Food Programme and the UNHCR issued a joint appeal for further international assistance to satisfy the needs for basic food items. While it may be correct that the WFP could cover only 11% of needs in October, it must be said that this figure relates only to deliveries from WFP and does not take account of deliveries from other donors.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO financed 300 tonnes of rice, delivered in October, and the use of the ECHO buffer stock I mentioned has made an important contribution, enabling us to satisfy the total needs for basic food products in October. So it is not the case that in October they only received 11%. As I have explained, the situation is much better.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the ECHO global plan for these refugees, which was adopted by the Commission this year. This plan, involving an amount of EUR 14.34 million, should reduce the full impact of the crisis. Over 80% of the ECHO 2002 global plan consists of food products. Under this plan, a further 5 000+ tonnes of basic foodstuffs are due to arrive in the coming weeks. In addition, over 3 000 tonnes of ECHO-financed supplementary food products will be supplied in the next few months. The WFP has also announced that it is sending over 4 000 tonnes of basic foodstuffs. This is the good news. Nevertheless, there is still cause for concern, particularly as regards the January and February distributions, owing to the possible lack of foodstuffs to satisfy total needs in that period.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some donor fatigue. This is the background. I agree with the question in this respect. This is also why ECHO is involved in different ways in raising donor awareness about this conflict and these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The High Commissioner, Mr Ruud Lubbers, used the word ‘unacceptable’ and I would add politically sordid.</p>
<p class="contents">If the political explanation for this unacceptable, from a humanitarian point of view, situation is donor fatigue, it must be said that some donors are fatigued by really very small sums. If there is any other explanation, this is all the more sordid, because there are much more worthy and, above all, effective ways to apply pressure than to make women and children suffer as a result of the issue of food aid.</p>

Some time ago, part of the Israeli Government prepared a dossier claiming to show that President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority used funds provided by the European Union, along with Norway and some other countries, to finance supporters of terrorism or even directly underwrite acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">These are most serious allegations. They have been carefully examined by the Commission. I should stress, as I have already done before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, on 19 June, that, on the basis of all the documents made available by the Israeli Government, the Commission has not found evidence of European Union funds being used for purposes other than those agreed between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission provides EUR 10 million a month to the Palestinian Authority in budgetary support. This constitutes 10% of their overall budget. European Union support has helped prevent the total collapse of Palestinian institutions and, therefore, preserved one of the interlocutors in the peace process. At the same time, it has provided the necessary pressure and guidance for serious reform, particularly in public finances. Let me remind the House that, ultimately, the European Union provides budgetary support to mitigate the effects of the freeze of revenue transfers totalling over USD 680 million by the Government of Israel over the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary assistance is subject to a number of conditions relating to administrative and judicial reform, financial control and so on, which are reviewed and strengthened on a regular basis. Disbursement of budgetary support is monitored on the ground by the Commission and the International Monetary Fund, which reports on a monthly basis on economic and fiscal developments and provides information covering revenue developments, evolution of employment, wage bill and non-wage current outlays, developments of capital expenditure and so on. The merits of our budgetary assistance have been widely recognised, not only by the Council of Ministers, but also by the international community. The United States and the other members of the quartet – the UN and the Russian Federation – have recognised the progress which has been made in the management of the Palestinian Authority's financial affairs, thanks to our aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Achievements in reform, which have been made largely thanks to our budgetary support, include the establishment of a single treasury account, the consolidation of all the Authority's public finances and progress towards a modern system of financial control. Next comes the imposition of an austerity budget, then the containment of arrears and, finally and very importantly, the adoption or entry into force of key legal acts, such as the judicial independence law and the basic law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth remembering that, in recent weeks, Israel has paid over USD 45 million to the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance, which is a small but still positive step. This money has been transferred into the same treasury account as the EU budgetary support and is subject to the same European Union and IMF monitoring mechanisms I have just described. I hope some Members will reflect on that sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel has therefore recognised that progress has been made in the financial domain, and that is in no small part due to our policy-based financial assistance and budgetary support. Ultimately, Israel should resume regular transfers and in that respect I welcome the constructive discussions held recently between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is our firm view that financial support should be continued. Withdrawal of budgetary support will lead to collapse of the Palestinian Authority, further chaos and a more desperate humanitarian crisis. The Commission will continue to monitor the use of budgetary support and compliance with all the conditions attached to it. We will, as always, investigate all allegations of the misuse of funds as a matter of the utmost priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who would not be? He knows that I am a man of legendary generosity of spirit, so perhaps I just have to take it as a fact of political life that however much you tell some people the truth, they prefer to ignore it. It would be helpful if some of those who keep making these accusations would sometimes turn up in the Chamber or at the committee meetings where I have been refuting the allegations. It might also help if they would occasionally read the newspapers and see what is being said and done about the reform of the Palestinian Authority. But I suspect that one or two of them have their own games to play, games that owe very little to fact but a good deal to prejudice and malevolent whimsy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the impact on conditions on the ground, the situation on the ground – and this is not easy to dispute – is appalling. We have recently had the report by the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, Catherine Bertini, followed up by a further study. The private remarks of the British Ambassador in Tel Aviv have been reported in the Israeli media. I do not believe for one moment that impoverishment, degradation or hunger – all of which have existed in some form in Palestine – are conducive to Israel's long-term security. Are you more or less likely to encourage lack of moderation or extremism in the conditions that exist in the West Bank and Gaza?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the points that Mr Pérez made to us during the EU-Israel Association Council yesterday about the humanitarian situation on the ground will lead to some improvement. I hope that the increase in our assistance to UNWRA will help improve the situation and I hope that the Israeli Government will listen to some of the things we are saying, for instance about the blocking of 500 containers of World Food Programme assistance in Ashdod Port at the moment. What does that have to do with the security of Israel?</p>
<p class="contents">So, I totally sympathise with the argument that Israel should have assurances about its security, but I do not think that making life intolerable for Palestinians is the right way of achieving that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have made available to Members of this House the report by heads of mission in Jerusalem, which again exposes the extent to which this is a simple, straightforward fabrication. So when the honourable Member asks me: why do I not welcome a committee of inquiry into a previous set of fabrications? What on earth does he think I will say?</p>
<p class="contents">Setting up such an inquiry – and I do not for one moment think that this House would vote for it – would make it look as though there were some legitimacy in these allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if you set up an inquiry like this, just think of the impact on everybody in my services who ever has to sign a cheque for UNWRA or for anything to do with the Palestinian Authority. It would have the effect of drying up assistance to the Palestinian Authority and to UN and humanitarian organisations because of the psychological effect, and this at a moment when we are preparing for the ad hoc liaison committee donors' meeting in early December, when the European Union – and my thanks to the budgetary authority and my colleague, the Commissioner for the budget – will be expected to take a lead in providing more humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians. Who will expect us to do that? The Americans will, the UN will and the Israelis will – not to mention the rest of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">So I say to the honourable Member, and I am sure that his question is not prompted by any malign motives, that the notion that this proposal to set up an inquiry is somehow helpful to me and to the cause of humanitarian relief in Palestine and to finding a political accommodation to save us from this blood feud, is about as far from reality as it is possible to go.

This amount covers the use of the financial accounting module by 600 civil servants, the vast majority working in the budget and Financial Control Directorates-General, as well as a few users in the internal and external audit services, for example the Court of Auditors, and in the operational Directorates-General.</p>
<p class="contents">On your third question: the actual number of users of the SAP financial accounting software currently stands at 300. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 42 by María Izquierdo Rojo (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0654_EN.html">H-0654/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the granting of visas</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 27 July 2002 the Spanish-Argentinian couple Juan Carlos Manteca Cendrero and Carlos Daniel Bettio submitted an application for a residence visa on the grounds of family reunification to the Spanish Consulate-General in Buenos Aires (Argentina) so that Daniel Bettio, an Argentinian citizen, would be able to reside legally in Spain. They attached the required documents, having been informed by the Consulate that visas had been granted in the past to people in the same situation, i.e. same-sex couples. On 13 August 2002 they received notification that the visa had been refused 'because they did not meet the conditions laid down in RD 864/2001'. The section where an indication must be made as to which specific condition has not been fulfilled states 'negative report of the government or labour authority'.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account of the specific circumstances of this case and the widely-held suspicion that same-sex couples are being refused visas, which would be a violation of equal rights, and bearing in mind that this would also be in breach of rights enshrined in the Spanish Constitution and EU law, in particular the Treaty of Amsterdam, which lays down that everyone enjoys equal rights regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can the Commission say whether it might be proposed that the burden of proof be reversed in view of such incidences of sexual discrimination (refusal to grant a visa to Carlos Daniel Bettio)? Is it aware that this type of discrimination in the granting of visas is occurring in the EU? What steps can be taken to prevent it? What measures are available to us to avert or take action in such cases</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Izquierdo Rojo considers this rejection to be discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Family reunification of citizens of the Union not covered by Community law in the field of free movement and residence, as in this case, is not yet the subject of a Community instrument and remains subject to the national law of each Member State. A refusal to grant the residence visa must be contested before the competent national authorities. Article 63(3)(a) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council shall take steps in the field of conditions of entry and residence, as well as standards concerning the procedures for issue of visas and long-term residence permits by the Member States, including for the purposes of family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">Family reunification measures must be adopted in accordance with the obligation to protect family life and the prohibition of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In its amended proposal for a Council directive on family reunification, the Commission, at the request of the Council, removed the provision designed to bring the family reunification of EU citizens’ family members, when said citizens are resident in a Member State of which they are a national and have not exercised their right to free movement, into line with the family reunification of EU citizens’ family members where said citizens have exercised their right to free movement. The situation of these people will therefore be addressed in a specific proposal at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation currently in force in the field of free movement and residence of EU citizens and members of their families provides for the family reunification of spouses, but not unmarried partners. In order to take account of the rapid evolution of the family unit in society and recognition in some Member States of special legal status for unmarried couples, as well as the need to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against unmarried partners of both sexes, the proposal for a directive on the right of EU citizens and members of their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, adopted by the Commission on 23 May 2001, extends the right to family reunification to unmarried partners where the legislation of the host Member State likens the situation of unmarried couples to that of married couples, in accordance with the conditions laid down by this legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very happy to tell you that, on 14 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political agreement on the Commission's proposal. This framework decision is one of the most far-reaching instruments so far when it comes to the approximation of criminal law. It addresses various forms of sexual exploitation of children, such as coercing a child into prostitution, pornographic performances and abuse of a recognised position of trust. Child pornography, both on- and offline, is also covered.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards penalties, the Council has taken steps to establish a general approach to the approximation of penalties. This is also the main reason why the Council took so long to adopt this framework decision. Now, the framework decision stipulates levels of penalties ranging from between one and three years for basic offences to between five and ten years in circumstances that aggravate the offence.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision does not approximate the age of sexual consent. The Commission believes that this is an issue for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. The age of sexual consent, as defined by national law, is, however, used as a dividing line for different levels of penalties. The idea is to reflect the principle that the younger the victim the worse the offence.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of final assistance, the STOP programme is a very valuable tool in combating paedophilia. The DAPHNE programme also specifically refers to paedophilia. The Commission will continue to support projects in this field through the new AGIS programme for law enforcement and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the final part of the question, the Commission can confirm that it has comparative information on the legislative and judicial means to combat this tragic phenomenon. Europol has produced a report on this subject, demonstrating that it is very active in combating child pornography. Europol has recently been involved in several successful large-scale operations. The Commission is convinced that once Eurojust is fully operational, it will encourage and improve cooperation between the Member States in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children, by facilitating mutual legal assistance and the implementation of extradition requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Designation of terrorists as 'political prisoners'</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the recent arrest of terrorists in Greece, most of those arrested have admitted belonging to the terrorist organisation ‘November 17’. However, over the last few days the Greek press has reported – on the basis of information from the above persons or their lawyers – that ‘some of them intend to alter their confessions with the aim of securing their release in 10-12 years' time’and have invoked the status of ‘political prisoner’ on the basis of ‘similar instances in other European countries’, as press publications and TV analyses have reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the existence of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, given that after the recent changes in Community legislation terrorists face tougher treatment, even if it is assumed that the murders and robberies they commit are inspired by ‘noble’ ideological motives?</p>

They have been recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Commission is therefore unaware of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, since the mere notion of political prisoners, that is, people who have been in prison or prosecuted only for political reasons or opinions, would be against those founding principles of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards extradition between Member States, therefore, mutual confidence in the national judicial systems has resulted in revision of the political offence derogation in relation to terrorist crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 5(1) of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union, which supplements the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 thus states: 'For the purposes of applying this Convention, no offence may be regarded by the requested Member State as a political offence, as an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.' This statement covers the terrorist offences referred to in the first and second articles of the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to which all Member States of the Union are party.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant, which will soon replace the previous extradition system, includes terrorism among the offences that will give rise to surrender, pursuant to a European arrest warrant, provided the offence is punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or detention order for a maximum period of at least three years. The political nature of the offence cannot be put forward as grounds for non-execution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism establishes a common definition of terrorist offences. It lists serious crimes deemed to be terrorist offences, when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population and unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation. In this definition, reference to ideological motives is therefore irrelevant, both for defining a terrorist offence or avoiding considering it as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the Commission's intention to cover this area when proposing new legislation on the protection of animals during transport before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Practical experience and scientific knowledge are today available to help the Commission in doing this. In particular, the Commission's objective is to ensure that Member States ensure that animal welfare considerations are an integral part of the operation of livestock markets. Acts of cruelty or negligence observed in some markets are the result of operators' ignorance and insufficient supervision by the competent authorities. Therefore, the Commission believes that it is necessary to increase the training of personnel handling animals at markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers that market operators should be primarily responsible for securing respect of welfare rules. They should be accountable for welfare rules as they already are for animal health rules. However, it should be remembered that day-to-day enforcement is the responsibility of the Member States. Substantial improvements can already be achieved under the current national provisions.</p>

I believe that in certain countries they have virtually ceased to exist. After all, it is not just a question of animal welfare, it is also a question of the spread of disease. Perhaps in the modern age such markets are no longer the best way of dealing with the trade in animals.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission concludes that they must remain, then they should be properly regulated.

There are long traditions in relation to the sale and marketing of animals in this way. Their use derives from historic and socio-economic reasons that cannot be ignored by a simple ban.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I agree that in addressing this issue in the context of Community legislation, we are looking at it in connection with the animal transport legislation we are working on at the moment. I fully agree that this issue is not just relevant to animals under transport, but to all animals. Nonetheless, it is in the context of that legislation that we are looking at the issue. As I indicated a moment ago, it is important to ensure that there is proper training of staff who handle animals, not only in the context of transport but generally.

Shortcomings in the proper implementation of the removal of specified risk material, in particular spinal cord, have been reported in carcasses produced in different Member States: Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has on several occasions reminded the Member States of the importance of properly implementing the removal of specified risk material. In the case of recurrence, the Commission has requested strong action, such as suspending the licences of the plants responsible or introducing corrective measures. The Commission has requested that it be informed of the corrective measures taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In subsequent inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office on BSE and BSE-related matters in the Member States, the removal of SRMs has been found to be reasonably satisfactory, with minor deficiencies relating mainly to technical and operational difficulties. The Commission is also funding a research project to find alternative and more effective ways to remove the spinal cord. This project is nearly finished.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely following the situation and will, if necessary, remind all the Member States of the obligation to remove the spinal cord of bovine animals aged over 12 months. Implementation of the corrective measures notified by the Member States to remedy the situation will be further assessed by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be borne in mind that the vertebral column is currently defined as specified risk material in carcasses from bovine animals aged over 12 months in all Member States except Portugal and the United Kingdom. Any remnants of spinal cord in the vertebral column should therefore already have been automatically removed as specified risk material at the place of destination before sale to the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely, and if the problems recur, will place the matter on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health to emphasise the importance of the proper removal of specified waste material, in other words, spinal cord, at slaughterhouse level, and to require strong corrective actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken directly to the competent ministers in a number of Member States about this, with the result that licences for slaughter plants have been suspended in two particular Member States for a period of time. These are strong sanctions which can be requested by the Commission and which have been implemented. To that extent, I believe that the strength of such sanctions, when imposed on food processors, is that they tend to improve standards. Ultimately, there is always the option of bringing infringement proceedings, but in these circumstances, given the passage of time necessary to get such proceedings into court, it does not seem to me to be the most effective method of seeking compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you probably are aware, I am currently working on a piece of legislation on feed and food controls, which envisages imposing financial sanctions for failure to comply with this kind of legislation. That will hopefully be brought to the Commission in the very near future and, if adopted, will be made public and come to Parliament in due course for further discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that by 2010 there will be thirty million people in the EU with diabetes. What is the Commission doing to address this catastrophic rise in diabetes and is the Commission proposing any research action or information campaigns to address this issue?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The Commission recognises that diabetes is a chronic disease that poses a major public health challenge to the Community. Its causes are closely linked to the health determinants of diet, obesity and physical activity. These determinants are clearly linked, and a separate approach to each is not likely to be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty limits the competence of the Community in the field of public health by stating that Community action must fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. As regards diabetes, the work of the Commission has therefore concentrated on encouraging cooperation between Member States through public health programmes. Through these programmes the Commission has encouraged policy development and measures related to the determinants of type 2 diabetes, namely nutrition, obesity and exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new public health programme entering into force on 1 January 2003, attention is given to improving data collection on key health indicators such as nutrition-related mortality and morbidity. Emphasis is also placed on developing common strategies on health determinants such as nutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing health promotion, health monitoring and cancer programmes have provided concrete support to a variety of initiatives on diet, nutrition, obesity and physical activity. For example, the support given to conferences such as those held under the French and Danish Council presidencies on the issues of nutrition and obesity. The Eurodiet report on nutrition is now published and available on the Commission website, making it available to a wide international audience.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), financed by the cancer programme and carried out by the International Agency for Cancer Research in Lyon, is another major initiative on the links between diet and disease. The project, supported by the health promotion programme <span class="italic">sli na sláinte</span>, is an initiative to promote physical activity as part of a prevention strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these activities will have had an impact on the prevention of diabetes. A status report on the place of nutrition in all Commission policy areas, not only public health, will shortly be finalised and published.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account of the limits set out in Article 152 of the Treaty, the Commission does not intend to set up a specific priority plan related to diabetes. Instead, the approach followed by the new public health programme is designed to ensure a complementary and horizontal approach to prevention, rather than the old approach of looking at diseases by means of separate and individual programmes. The new programme is policy-driven and aims to promote policy and activities on health determinants that will have an impact on key challenges such as type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its framework research programmes the Commission has supported diabetes research in the past. Significant financial support has been made available for this type of research. In the Fifth Framework Programme, diabetes research was covered under the quality of life and management of living resources programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The total funding has been more than EUR 18 million. Diabetes research continues to be a priority in the upcoming Sixth Framework Programme under the first priority thematic area 'Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health'.</p>
<p class="contents">Research funds will be distributed on a competitive basis following calls for proposals, and information will be made widely available, for example on the research website. In addition to support for research projects, the Sixth Framework Programme will provide funds for fellowships as well as for networking of national diabetes research activities under the chapter 'Strengthening the foundations of the European research area'. That aspect is considered particularly important in order to contribute to the creation of a European research area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should also be mentioned that foods presented as designed to satisfy the particular nutritional requirements of people with diabetes should currently comply with the requirements of Council Directive 89/398 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses. The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the desirability of special nutritional provisions for people with diabetes.</p>
<p class="contents">May I take this opportunity to wish every success to World Diabetes Day on 14 November. I hope to be able to join with those who are promoting this when the diabetes testing and awareness campaign is launched here in Strasbourg on 19 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to raise a couple of issues with you. Firstly, all the best thinking on diabetes is that special food should not be targeted at diabetics. The best diet for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes is good, plain, fresh food, not processed foods.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme. I hope that when you are considering it, the provision of a chair for diabetes nurses in one of the Community universities will be one of the priorities for support.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost to the health services within the Community of a condition which, as I mentioned in my question, will affect approximately 30 million people by the year 2010, has to some extent to be taken into consideration. In the light of what is coming down the line, I would be interested to know whether the Commission proposes to take a more proactive approach to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact of the matter is that public health professionals and, indeed, some governments are now giving more attention to investing more in health promotion and disease prevention. The emphasis in the past has all too often been on spending large sums of money on health care.</p>
<p class="contents">If this change takes place, as your question implies, that will greatly affect the issue of diabetes, on which you focus particularly in in your question, but also other diseases. I firmly believe that, when the public health programme is up and running under the three-stranded approach from January 2003, valuable information and data will be gathered under the first strand. Then, under the strand of health determinants, we will be able to promote the healthy lifestyle and balanced food intake that you mentioned in your supplementary question. I am looking into the correlation between, for instance, diseases like obesity and food, and I hope to report the results between now and the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 48 by Marit Paulsen (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0660_EN.html">H-0660/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Salmonella and meat preparations</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 12 November 2001, the Swedish requirement that meat preparations imported from other Member States must undergo compulsory testing by the Swedish authorities was abandoned after the Commission had pointed out to the Swedish Food Administration that meat preparations – such as marinated chicken – were not covered by the salmonella guarantees that Sweden had negotiated on accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2002, the Swedish Food Administration and five municipalities in Sweden are investigating the presence of salmonella in meat preparations imported from other Member States. The results so far show that approximately one third of the sampled batches have tested positive for salmonella.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it really the Commission's intention to exacerbate the situation in regard to the spread of salmonella within those areas of the EU which are relatively uncontaminated, at the same time as working on a regulation to achieve a uniform situation with regard to salmonella throughout the Union?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 49 by Jonas Sjöstedt (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0669_EN.html">H-0669/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Salmonella in marinated meat</span></p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with five Swedish municipalities, the Swedish National Food Administration has taken some 40 samples of imported meat preparations, approximately one third of which tested positive for salmonella. Chicken products were the worst offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2001, the Commission decided that the rule concerning compulsory salmonella testing does not apply to meat preparations. However, when meat preparations are imported from a country outside the EU, the Swedish guarantee applies.</p>
<p class="contents">The tests conducted in Sweden show that meat preparations must be subject to compulsory salmonella testing if the salmonella guarantee is to be effective in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that meat preparations are subject, as soon as possible, to compulsory salmonella testing before being exported to Sweden?</p>

These additional guarantees cover the trade of certain live animals, eggs, fresh fish and mincemeat to Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">You propose that the Commission should extend the additional salmonella guarantees to meat preparations. The only way to do so would be to amend the Community legislation on meat preparations. However, the directive on mincemeat and meat preparations already lays down a salmonella criterion for meat preparations. Any meat preparation produced within the Community must meet that criterion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that salmonella disappears in such products and only new contamination will reintroduce salmonella into them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, it is about the fact that anyone can put a chicken in a bag with a few grams of salt and claim that it is a preparation. That is the main problem. It is slightly absurd that I am Parliament’s rapporteur in the case of a directive aimed at creating salmonella controls across the whole of the EU which look very much like the Scandinavian controls. As such, it is a little odd that a quick decision cannot be taken on having a salmonella guarantee for preparations which are <span class="italic">not </span>heat treated.

The reason why the additional guarantees should not cover meat preparations, the existence of the salmonella criterion, applies also to mincemeat. However, it has to be noted that it is probably easier to control salmonella in meat preparations than in mincemeat. Therefore the salmonella criteria are more effective for meat preparations than for mincemeat and this can be used to justify the application of additional guarantees to mincemeat and not to meat preparations.</p>

Concerning the regulation of contents of tobacco products, the text released by the chair for further discussion does not set harmonised standards but provides for each party to adopt and implement standards as recommended by the Conference of the Parties, including standards and best practices for testing and measuring the content and emissions of such products. The final text of the Convention is expected to be ready in March 2003. Should this provision become a part of the final text of the Framework Convention, and considering the timetable foreseen for the establishment of the Conference of the Parties, it is indeed possible that such recommendations could be produced by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the adoption of common standards for the regulation of the content of tobacco products and emissions and the adoption of common rules for measurement methods are essential measures to be taken by all parties to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Recommendations made by the Conference of the Parties can be a very important instrument for harmonising standards, and parties should therefore be called upon to duly consider them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as such harmonisation could lead to a lowering of the level of public health protection, the Community's position is that such recommendations should not be binding. That is to say, their adoption should be left to the discretion of the parties. This would allow parties, such as the Community, to keep their already existing strong legislation in this field. In this context, I would like to draw to Mr Wuermeling's attention the fact that, according to the negotiating directives provided by the Council, the negotiations must aim to base the operative provisions of the Framework Convention on existing Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the very last part of Mr Wuermeling's question, the Commission firmly believes that the negotiations on the Framework Convention will be successful and is doing its utmost to ensure that an efficient instrument with the maximum impact on tobacco consumption will be agreed upon. However, in the extremely unlikely event that the negotiations should fail, the Commission would not see this as a reason to propose modifying the provisions of Directive 2001/37 on exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, public health cannot take second place to job considerations. That is fundamental as far as I am concerned. I have already said that on a number of occasions. Even if there were concern about jobs, some work was undertaken on this when the legislation we now have before Parliament was being considered. There was certainly some evidence available to us in those Member States that introduced, for instance, strict legislation banning the advertising of tobacco products. Unemployment did not increase as a result. There was a shift in other directions.
