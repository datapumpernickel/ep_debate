<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – I welcome very much this opportunity to take stock of progress and achievement in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice in 2002, as we do every year. Strictly, according to the Treaty we are supposed to do so only on Third Pillar matters of criminal law, police and judicial cooperation. That does not make any sense, so we allow ourselves to range a little wider, and bring in asylum and immigration as well. I confess that due to one of those artificial but practical demarcations we have to live with, my vision has not widened to include civil law measures on access to justice. They are dealt with in this House by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and I am representing the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. It is not very satisfactory, and our two committees ought to work together on this annual report. However, I am encouraged by the fact that my own committee is very united in its broad critique of progress in Justice and Home Affairs, even though we have robust disagreement on actual policy content.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions we are putting today to the Council and the Commission reflect three broad strands of concern – coherence, balance and democratic accountability – that we have identified in the almost four years since the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty came into force, and the three-and-a-half years since the Tampere Summit and the freedom, justice and security roadmap outlined in its conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first concern is whether there is sufficient coherence in the work being done; whether the strategies, plans and scoreboards are being followed. We feel that the use by Member States of their right of initiative has been unhelpful to consistent progress through the work programme. If there was real consultation in the Council and a majority view that a proposal was truly needed to fill a gap in the Commission's output, that might be one thing. What we have in practice is a nice little opportunity for individual ministers, not necessarily even speaking coherently for their government, to stage a few press conferences for domestic consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is understandable that the terrible experiences of 11 September gave a boost to anti-terrorism measures and the European arrest warrant, the deflection from the parallel goals of boosting guarantees of fundamental rights and civil liberties is less understandable. We are only now on the brink of getting proposals for strengthening rights to a fair trial and legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are still lacking measures to protect data privacy against snooping on e-mails, telephone calls and Internet usage.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an obvious lack of coherence in the area of asylum policy, where there has not been a rapid and coherent achievement of all the elements of a common policy. We still have no agreement on matters like the definition of a refugee or the procedures for deciding asylum claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern is the related issue of lack of balance. This can also be illustrated, particularly in the area of asylum and immigration, where there has been much emphasis on the repressive aspects, however necessary, of the fight against illegal immigration but very little on the goals of integration through family reunion and the legal rights of long-term migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Our last concern is the absence of sufficient democratic accountability. We welcome the report of Working Group X of the Convention. We support their conclusions, seeking to remove the impediments to the achievement of democratic accountability and coherent decision-making. They call for qualified majority voting to be the rule in the Council and for democratic scrutiny and full partnership with the European Parliament to be reinforced through an extension of the codecision procedure. We very much support that.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see an end to the Third Pillar system for police and judicial cooperation and a much simpler and clearly discernible allocation of competences between EU and national levels. We would also like a political dialogue with national parliaments. We therefore ask the Council and Commission to answer the questions we have put to them today in the light of those concerns, which are shared across the spectrum of the political groups in our committee. Some progress was made, there was some activity in 2002, but the conclusion has to be 'could do better'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Petsalnikos,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity today of presenting the results of the work of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in 2002 to the European Parliament. The Greek Presidency attaches particular importance to the role of the European Parliament, to dialogue with it and to the need for a common policy on issues of concern to us. I should like at this point to thank Baroness Ludford, whose oral question has provided the basis for today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council worked systematically during 2002 towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice, mainly on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the European Council in Tampere. Within that framework, the Council adopted a set of acts on police and judicial cooperation on criminal and civil matters. In all, over 100 acts were adopted, including regulations, framework decisions, decisions and joint positions, resolutions, recommendations and other acts. Parliament itself made a telling contribution to this work through the consultation procedure and with its excellent resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the acts adopted, I should like to make special mention of Eurojust, the new Union institution whose job is to step up the fight against the most serious forms of crime, and the framework decisions adopted on the European arrest warrant, extradition procedures between Member States and the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention the new European Refugee Fund, the new Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints, the minimum specifications governing the provision of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of refugees, the integrated plan for combating illegal immigration and illegal movements of people within the European Union, the plan for guarding our external borders, the common list of third countries whose nationals must have a visa and the complementary list of third countries whose nationals do not need a visa and the standard form for a residence permit for third-country nationals. Finally, in civil and commercial law, political agreement has been reached on a system of judicial assistance on parental care in order to protect the best interests of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the questions, not that this list is by any means complete. An area of freedom, security and justice has to be founded on the principles of transparency and democratic control and I can assure you that the Council’s actions will continue to be predicated on maximum possible cooperation with the other institutions of the European Union and constructive dialogue with civil society. Within this framework, the Council works with the European Parliament, seeking its opinion in the early stages of work and duly applying all the consultation rules set out in the Treaties. The Presidency attends Parliament in order to present its programme of work at the beginning of each term of office and the results of the Justice and Home Affairs Councils. I would also remind you that the Council replies to all written and oral questions put to it by the honourable Members. At the same time, informal contacts are constantly being strengthened, especially at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms or at informal ministerial meetings. Finally, this cooperation will be strengthened still further by the Treaty of Nice, which now applies the codecision procedure to a number of matters which come within our jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the second question, the Council does not believe that adopting Community acts on sensitive justice and home affairs issues is taking an inordinate amount of time. First of all, the number and content of the acts adopted is proof positive of the volume of work we have carried out in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice. However, the question of speed also needs to be placed within the context of how carefully each issue is examined and the fact that all the procedures are adhered to, especially the consultation procedure and, from now on, the codecision procedure, so that the Council can take due account of the opinion of the European Parliament. That is why opinions are indeed sometimes requested by fairly tight deadlines, so that acts can be adopted at Council level as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the third question, the Council would point out that its work is carried out within the framework of the rules laid down in the Treaties. For example, immigration issues are addressed under Title ΙV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, while crimes by persons aiding and abetting illegal immigration are dealt with under the rules set out in Title VΙ of the Treaty on European Union. Because the issue is so complex, a certain procedural speed is required, but that derives from the Treaty itself and is not of the Council’s making. As you know, the Council has no authority to amend the Treaty. We are, of course, monitoring the work being carried out in this respect by the Convention on the future of Europe, which may well open up new prospects; we hope it does. Until then, I can assure you that all of us in the Council are endeavouring to promote cohesive, rational policy, and are demonstrating the necessary political will.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the fourth question, the Council would point out that creating an area of freedom, security and justice is an ongoing project, resulting in increasingly close, progressive cooperation between the Member States, as they exercise their authority, and the institutions of the European Union. The initiatives taken by the Member States within this framework, either alone or jointly, prove exactly how useful that right is. You only have to think, for example, of the initiative submitted by 5 Member States which resulted in the creation of Eurojust, a Community institution which plays an important role in the fight against serious forms of crime. Similarly, the Council’s framework decision on the status of victims during criminal proceedings was initiated by one Member State. The regulation on insolvency proceedings initiated by two Member States finally brought about a result after a full thirty years of discussion within the Community framework. The regulation on obtaining evidence is another such success story. The initiatives taken by the Member States, most of which have been adopted, have helped to make justice and home affairs a particularly dynamic sector and have been a useful complement to the valuable initiatives taken by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the fifth question, under the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council will be required five years after the Treaty enters into force, i.e. in 2004, to reach a unanimous decision, following consultations with the European Parliament, on the codecision procedure for visas, asylum and immigration and on judicial cooperation in civil matters. The Council has not yet been asked to decide on the specific issue raised in the question. Consequently, this is a question the Council will have an opportunity to decide on in the future, taking account of the opinion of the European Parliament. For the rest, as you know, the Treaty of Nice, which has already taken effect, makes provision for the codecision procedure to apply to a number of issues and the Council will be applying these new rules to the letter.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the sixth question, as I said earlier, the Council has made considerable progress on asylum and immigration with a view to applying the programme adopted in Tampere. The European Council in Seville, on 21 and 22 June 2002, took an important step towards implementing the Tampere programme. As far as the timing is concerned, the Council has every intention of keeping to the deadlines, where possible, given the complexity of this subject and the fact that events have undoubtedly altered the general perception of the political and legislative environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the final question, as it has stressed on numerous occasions, the Council respects and applies the principles laid down in the Treaty, especially the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. However, the possible inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty is an issue which does not come within the jurisdiction granted to the Council under the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the second part of the question concerning work on common principles governing procedural guarantees for defendants, the Council knows that the Commission has issued a working paper and is preparing a new text. When we receive a proposal, we shall examine it carefully and ask the European Parliament to give its opinion on the matter, allowing it adequate time to do so. However, this last question gives me the opportunity to conclude with a number of the Greek Presidency’s thoughts on the question of human rights in the judicial sector. We are convinced of, and our initiatives will be geared towards, the principle that respect for human rights and the rule of law is the cornerstone of the European Union and the ultimate justification for all its policies. At the same time, we need balanced, global policies. These two principles are inextricably linked. I believe that, if the importance of fundamental freedoms is overlooked, there will be a visible risk of our policy becoming fragmented, unilateral and irrational. This is particularly important in the area in which our Council acts, where the issue of the balance between freedom, on the one hand, and security, on the other, arises on a daily basis. It would be a mistake to assume that these two virtues are mutually exclusive. I have pointed out on numerous occasions, and I do so again now, that more security does not mean and must not mean less freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">With these thoughts in mind, the Greek Presidency has introduced a new framework decision on the mutual recognition by Member States of final judgments in criminal cases. We cannot take a unilateral approach to judicial assistance. We also have to make sure that defendants cannot be prosecuted for the same offence in more than one Member State. The same principle governs the question of minimum guarantees for suspects and defendants. We are introducing the European arrest warrant, we are taking measures to harmonise substantive criminal law and we must not ignore the question of guarantees for all those affected by these measures, especially suspects and defendants, which is why we have already included the question of minimum procedural guarantees for suspects and defendants on the agenda of the informal Council due to meet in Greece at the end of March.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to close by thanking you once again for giving me this opportunity to update the European Parliament on progress in the area of justice and security and to assure you that I am looking forward to your assistance and cooperation so that we can meet the expectations of European society and its citizens.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, I wish to congratulate Baroness Ludford on the quality of the questions she has put to the Commission and to answer the first of these by saying that the Commission still takes the view that the future Treaty on the area of freedom, security and justice should enshrine the principle of the Commission’s exclusive right of legislative initiative. Indeed, we feel that the transfer of the majority of legislative aspects to the codecision process will only be coherent if we retain the framework of the Commission’s right of legislative initiative. Giving the right of legislative initiative to a Member State or to some Member States will always cause problems and confusion in implementing common codecision rules. I would add that the Commission’s right of initiative is today the most appropriate, precisely because it is exercised in the framework of a set of interinstitutional programmes agreed with the European Parliament and with the European Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second question, dealing with the priority given to combating terrorism and illegal immigration, the Commission believes that these were not only priorities in 2002, but will also be priorities in 2003. The European Union has demonstrated its ability to respond to the terrorist threat by adopting two important instruments: the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism. From the Commission’s point of view, the final text of these two legislative initiatives will ensure a healthy balance between the objectives intended to facilitate investigations and prosecutions against terrorists, on the one hand, and, on the other, the protection of defendants’ rights, but I shall return to this issue a little later.</p>
<p class="contents">The Seville European Council gave new impetus to speeding up all aspects of implementing the programme adopted in Tampere with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice. New priority has been given to measures intended to combat illegal immigration and to establish the common management of our external borders. At the same time, however, the Seville Council also laid down objectives and timetables for adopting the other decisions in the field of asylum and immigration policy laid down in the Tampere Council conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission responded quickly to this new priority by presenting its proposals for an integrated management system for external borders, that was generally well received by the Council and included in the action plan that was not only approved by the Council last June, but was also recently endorsed by the European Parliament in a resolution voted on last month.</p>
<p class="contents">This progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere. Progress must also be in line with an approach that is balanced between the three components: freedom, security and justice. The Commission emphasised once again in the last scoreboard, of 16 December 2002, that there are still delays in adopting asylum and immigration issues. We hope that the Greek Presidency will, as the Minister has just stated, give a commitment to speeding up work on adopting this legislation within the framework laid down by the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the fourth issue raised by Baroness Ludford, I wish to say that the Greek Presidency has given pride of place on its agenda to the debate on family reunification and on the status of long-term residents in the European Union, together with the directive that Parliament debated yesterday, on the entry of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and with the directive on the conditions of entry and residence for citizens from third countries for the purpose of study. We will consequently have the basic legislative framework in the field of immigration policy that is being discussed in Council. I would also add the initiative that the Commission will be adopting next month to present a communication focusing on the issue of integrating third-country nationals into European reception societies.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future of decision-making processes, the Commission welcomes the conclusions reached by the Convention’s working group on Justice and Home Affairs, because it acknowledges that in issues of asylum, immigration and other policies involving freedom of movement, the general rule for decision-making must be to adopt legislative acts under the codecision process, in which the Council reaches agreement by qualified majority. I also welcome the fact that this conclusion has been reached by the Convention’s working group with a broad majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of changes to the Treaty, the Commission is encouraging the Convention to adopt the rule of a more explicit legal basis for developing a common European asylum system that goes beyond the mere minimum common rules that the Council is currently discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue the honourable Member raised concerning the usefulness and effectiveness of the networks, the Commission wishes to state clearly to Parliament that its assessment of the work undertaken by the networks that have real operational duties, such as Europol, Eurojust, or bodies such as the Chiefs of Police task-force and the judicial networks in civil and criminal matters, is positive. Nevertheless, we must emphasise that not all networks present the same added value and that the Council should be more particular in selecting its priorities for establishing these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the relationship between the Commission and the European Parliament, the Commission is attempting scrupulously to comply with the framework agreement signed by the two institutions on 5 July 2000. In this context, I intend, as early as next week in Brussels, to inform the European Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of developments in the negotiations underway on readmission agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of evaluating the way in which framework decisions are transposed into the national legal system of each State, The Commission wishes to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that evaluation methods vary from framework decision to framework decision. Our view is that priority should now be given to the framework decision on combating terrorism, which should be transposed by all Member States by the end of 2002. We are gathering information from the Member States on this transposal and we hope to be able to present the corresponding report by the end of 2003. As always, the Commission is paying particular attention to achieving the necessary balance between respect for the law and for the protection of people’s fundamental rights and the fight against organised crime and terrorism. To this end, following a recommendation of the European Parliament, the Commission has created a network of experts in fundamental rights. This year’s report on this network of experts focuses in particular on the compatibility of the measures adopted by the Member States and by the European Union on the fight against terrorism and respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the rapporteur’s last question on the framework decision on procedural guarantees for persons standing trial, the Commission welcomes the Greek Presidency’s intention to include this matter in the discussion at the Véria informal Council at the end of March. For our part, before this Council we will be adopting a Green Paper on common rules for procedural guarantees for persons standing trial anywhere in the Union. This Green Paper will give civil society and legal professionals, in both current and future Member States, the opportunity to contribute to the debate, with a view to our presenting a proposal for a framework decision that we believe must be scheduled by the end of this year. The Commission is consequently committed to establishing minimum common rules in this field, as stated in its presentation of the annual work programme for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by announcing that work is also underway on guarantees for equal treatment in gathering and processing evidence and the on the right to remain silent during trial. We believe these matters to be particularly important for creating a common base, a common platform in criminal cases, in order to make mutual trust and cooperation between judicial authorities more effective in the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the progress that has been made is unequivocal and undeniable. They are not balanced in all aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice, but in light of this experience we can help the Convention on the Future of Europe to overcome the main institutional and procedural difficulties to ensure that the Union becomes an area of peace, prosperity, freedom, cohesion, security and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Boetticher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for Baroness Ludford's question, which, being comprehensive in its scope, was a very good one.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than endorse the rapporteur's constitutional thinking on the subject of asylum and immigration policy. We need majority voting in the Council, Parliament needs to have the power of codecision, and the right of the Member States to propose legislation needs to be limited, as it is mainly used for reasons of domestic policy and rarely advances the cause of European Union. She is also right in her conclusion that the EU is a long way from implementing what was decided at Tampere. Whilst Baroness Ludford regards the Council as being to blame for this, I take the contrary view that the Commission must shoulder a large share of the responsibility for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino, although the Treaties require minimum standards of you, you wanted to go ahead and generously broaden the scope of both the Convention on Refugees and the provisions of national law, and your attempts to do so failed at Council level on many occasions. It might be a good idea if you were to slowly learn the error of your ways; your new proposal on the reunification of families certainly gives us hope that you are willing to do so. It so happens, Baroness Ludford, that minimum standards are often the lowest common denominator. The Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission's commitment to combating illegal immigration, which demonstrates, Commissioner Vitorino, that you can see that there are two sides to the coin and that you are getting down to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn to counter-terrorism, an area in which 2002 has seen great progress made. The common definition of terrorism, the European arrest warrant, and the reinforcement of Europol were important milestones on the road towards terrorism being effectively combated in Europe. I would like to take this opportunity to specifically call upon the Council to make use of the funds we have allocated to Europol, which amount to over EUR 3 million, for if they do not do so, nobody will be in a position, in the event of one or more attacks in Europe, to coordinate or to lead police operations. Your disputes about competence will not, at any rate, meet with much public sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ludford has diagnosed an imbalance between the methods of counter-terrorism on the one hand and guaranteed fundamental rights on the other. I do not see that such is the case. Laws at national and European level have made very good provision for data protection, we have extensive systems for defence and legal protection, and direct intervention can, of course, still only be carried out at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">She is right, however, to demand that Europol and Eurojust – which latter has had a successful start – should be brought within the Community sphere, for that, in the long term, is the only way to guarantee effective democratic and juridical control and to prevent duplication of structures. It is clear to see that, if Eurojust were to be brought within the Community sphere, it could take over OLAF's tasks as well as ensuring that the Community's financial interest was protected. As well as that, though, the Schengen Agreement and its associated information system have to be brought within the Community sphere. I might add, by the way, that the plethora of information systems will function effectively only when they are interconnected and equipped with standard rules on data protection, which could also be monitored by the new data protection commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we also need a new coordination body for the external borders, by which I mean a sort of ‘Eurobord’ or ‘Euroguard’. Open internal borders mean that it is in the interest of all Member States that Poland's eastern border, the waters of the Italian Adriatic, and the Straits of Gibraltar should be secured, and this calls for solidarity on their part. I might add that the EU has wasted years of valuable time when it comes to these matters, which are closely connected with its own enlargement. For far too long, Commissioner Verheugen has been lulling the EU to sleep and reassuring it that no reforms are needed. The second generation SIS has now been delayed, and frameworks for common border control are also only in their early stages – all this with enlargement one year away. These are issues where we have to work, even now, much more closely with the candidate countries than we have done before. We all have a long road ahead of us before we can present the Europe of freedom, security and justice to its citizens, but we have to take the first steps, and, Commissioner, let me add that the Convention has to become even more courageous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would also like to thank the Council and the European Commission for their comprehensive replies.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I agree with both the Council and the Commission that it is fair to say that we have made a lot of progress in the field of cooperation on criminal matters. So much so that it now seems reasonable – and I hope that everyone agrees – that we should expect and ask for the proposals which the Commissioner has put forward here, more than once, in relation to improving judicial standards in the European Union and creating common minimum standards which guarantee to the European citizens that this framework of criminal cooperation reinforces not only their freedom and security but also the efficiency of justice. I believe that this is really positive.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the fight against this type of cross-border crime, I would simply like to draw attention to the Conference which took place in Brussels with regard to trafficking in women and children. I believe that the citizens expect us to deal with this issue from a Community point of view. We adopted a declaration, the Brussels Declaration, which had our full support, and I believe we should take the lead in the implementation of the measures it called for.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to asylum and immigration, the truth is that I have been perplexed all day. I do not understand what is going on here. We have often said in this House that we endorsed the Tampere agreements, that we wanted a common, balanced and global immigration policy, in the way that all the Ministers, including those from the PPE group, had stated in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that the framework referred to by Mr Vitorino is the one we need in order to create this common area for immigration and asylum, in the terms indicated by the Commission and undoubtedly in the terms which inspired the debates in the Parliament and the Council. Now it seems that, on the contrary, we are only calling for certain minimal things in the field of immigration. I do not understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr von Boetticher, that you are not in the government at some time in the future and that we do not hear you saying, 'This is a European problem which must be dealt with from a European perspective', as so many Prime Ministers affiliated to the PPE do, quite rightly.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this can carry on and to this end I hope that the Convention will grant Parliament and the Council co-decision powers, as the Commissioner requested, in the field of justice, freedom and security, because the citizens must be secure in this area, and that the Commission will have its right to initiative returned so that progress can be made logically and coherently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, 1999 already seems ages ago. That was the year that the agreements we know well – indeed, with which we are all too familiar – were reached in Tampere on the new European asylum and migration policy to be set up and a deadline was even attached to that, 5 years. Now we are in 2003, and not much has happened. I think that as far as that is concerned I am rather less enthusiastic about the outcomes of the Seville Summit, as will also be clear from our support for the position of our rapporteur Baroness Ludford.</p>
<p class="contents">What I say is not entirely true, of course, because actually a lot has happened, only not in the dusty chambers of the Council. Since 1999, roughly 700 000 legal migrants a year have come to the European Union to work. And in those same four years around two million illegals have entered Europe. Of course that was not the intention, but you cannot say that Europe is full, even though the feeling has certainly arisen in some Member States that immigration is responsible for serious social tension and that the sharing of responsibilities between the Member States has not been at all fair. That is one of the reasons for adopting a European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, the Netherlands, immigration for work has doubled since 1998 but against this stream of migrants we are dealing with a Europe that is getting older and older. In the Netherlands 20% of the population will be over 65 within 20 years, in Germany a similar figure has already been reached and what we call the ‘grey wave’ means that by 2050 there will be 80 pensioners for every 100 working people. At the moment there are 40 for every 100. It is not hard to imagine the effects this will have on the welfare state and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that the Council has been ignoring the long view. Recent years tell the story of how it has continued to look anxiously at how things are going and taken decisions on an ad hoc basis. We need to get real; now is the time to act. Immigration, of whatever kind, and the ageing of the population pay no attention to the passing of time; they just carry on unabated. There is no solution to be found in either a Fortress Europe or a rejuvenating elixir. My proposal to the Council is that we take a decision on European immigration policy during the Greek Presidency and stop pussyfooting around.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Parliament voted on a directive on the entry and residence of citizens of third countries who want to enter the European Union to work. If you, the Council, really want to mean something to the citizens of Europe, vote for this directive. That would demonstrate foresight and with that initiative towards a sort of blue card we could start to regulate labour migration more effectively to the benefit of both groups, the migrants themselves and the countries that receive them. I ask the Council not to avoid that decision now and to remember that those who really want to get over that high fence into Europe come with all the social tensions associated with that and so it is sensible to create a gateway so that their entry is regulated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be admitted that the call to combat terrorism is leading to so-called security measures which sometimes interfere with fundamental rights, at the risk of intensifying a trend which already exists. Therefore, although the proposals resulting from the meeting of the Convention working party are worthy of interest, the events of 11 September have been explicitly quoted as justification for a high level of Community control in fields such as cross-border crime, asylum policy or the control of the external borders of the Union, and yet this process of amalgamation has not given rise to any indignation.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, the so-called 'internal security' bill drawn up by the Minister for Internal Affairs targets a whole range of actions: the illegal installation of travellers, the holding of meetings in the entrance halls of blocks of flats, aggressive begging, so-called 'passive or active' soliciting, explicitly aimed at foreign prostitutes, and all these things constitute offences which attract heavy fines and, in some cases, prison sentences. In other words, what we have here is simply a bill which lumps together immigration, poverty and insecurity. In addition, as far as any immigration and asylum policy is concerned, the current French proposals can be boiled down to the setting up of quotas for tourist visas, the drawing up of a list of so-called safe countries, compulsory repatriation or the creation of a corps of European border guards. However, to impose quotas or talk about managing migratory flows, while at the same time recruiting the brains and muscle power from the South which are useful to the 'European market' is a hypocrisy which in actual fact is helping to conceal the networks of people smugglers, to encourage people to emigrate to a life of wretchedness and exploitation, and even to criminalise migrants to the detriment of a policy based on equal rights and freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Seville Council gave a very bad signal here when it reduced the European approach to immigration to the setting of even stricter conditions for access and residence, and even cashed in on economic aid as a result. Yet how can talking more about policing than about trade, and more about insecurity than about liberty, contribute towards the development revelled in by so many liberal European speeches, without any human exchanges and without movement? The closure of the camp at Sangatte in the north of France is proof, if proof were needed, that the closing of borders does nothing to reduce the distress of men and women who are fleeing persecution, conflict or poverty. The most vulnerable people and ethnic minorities are the ones most severely affected by this repressive policy. I am thinking of the Romany people, whom the European Union is threatening with expulsion and rejecting in practice. I am thinking of the illegal immigrants who, in France, despite their legitimate perseverance in wanting to live there legally, are prevented from doing so by a policy of hindrance, arrest and expulsion.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there is so much that needs to be done in order to take initiatives drawn up in a spirit of opening up to the world and welcoming it, for example by contributing towards real cooperation on development, ensuring equality in the social and economic services, in access to employment for everyone, but also in civil rights. I am thinking of the regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants, or the Madrid appeal for residential citizenship, the recognition of voting rights and eligibility for local and European elections. What Europe needs, therefore, is a new immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that her pertinent oral questions have enabled us to have a debate which is obviously very interesting. I agree essentially with her analysis of the situation. I believe that we cannot really accuse the Council of any lack of activity this year. One might even say that the Council was overcome by a kind of feverishness, obviously under the influence of the atmosphere produced by the events of 11 September, the ultra-security-consciousness of public opinion and, more directly, electoral concerns, which shows quite clearly that the study of a certain number of issues would profit by being shared equally between opinions, through the positions adopted by the European Parliament and the initiatives of the Commission. When it comes to the general interests of Europe, the sum of national egoisms does not constitute the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to work which is currently in progress. My group has had the pleasure of bringing together a certain number of involved people from all over Europe, who are studying the question of the isolation of foreigners in Europe. It is quite frightening. The analyses that have been made, on a country by country basis, show that there have been considerable developments which are quite alarming. Camps are proliferating, camps in all forms, of all kinds, with or without official status, open or closed, in which foreigners are sorted, guarded, imprisoned, punished, and kept handy for forced repatriation or whatever. I believe that these obvious denials of people’s right, for example to seek asylum in Europe, are extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to examine these practices closely and to determine to what extent, since they are initially the responsibility of national States, European policy is likely to result in or encourage actions of this type on the part of Member States. For example, we discovered at the seminar that readmission agreements were actually an incitement to Member States to create such camps. In the final analysis, therefore, the question is whether, in the light of what I believe to be the satisfactory results of the Convention working party, we should encourage the Council to work this year, or whether we ought to wait until new decision-making methods make it possible to achieve greater equilibrium between the three aspects of the area that we have been talking about just now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For obvious reasons it was felt necessary to establish more ambitious targets in areas such as illegal immigration, border control, the European arrest warrant, asylum and police and judicial cooperation, amongst others. Something that has also made a positive contribution to these developments, and I cannot deny this, is the dynamism of Commissioner Vitorino, who is responsible for these matters within the Commission and whom I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate. We cannot forget, however, that these matters are of enormous political sensitivity. We are invading the traditional sovereign borders of the Member States, a fact that cannot be ignored or played down. Recent international events are a clear reminder that the European Union is still made up of sovereign States. It is also the rights and the obligations of their citizens, however, that are at stake here and which must be acknowledged and defined with a sense of responsibility, in an attempt to respond to the needs imposed on us all by the complex current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the short time I have left, I shall concentrate on the new terrorist threats, which require action at European level and solidarity at international level. In fact, the way in which we approach terrorism these days is completely different to the approach pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. We know that the terrorist threat today is hard to see and is underpinned by motives other than political ones. As a rule, it acts illegitimately, I repeat, illegitimately, in the name of a given civilisation in the aim of setting this on a collision course with our own. Today’s form of terrorism is well known: it selects its targets according to the visibility of the results of its action, which incidentally makes all of us and our institutions possible targets. We also know that it is extremely mobile and that it uses, as we all do, modern means of communication. We know that its sources of funding are diverse and that this funding is often obtained under the guise of promoting respectable aims. No less importantly, we know that it certainly has access to arms of mass destruction, especially chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, we must of course provide responses that go beyond the national sphere and even the spheres of action for justice and domestic security, which naturally highlights the importance of this debate of ours. The presence of these new terrorist threats undeniably requires action at European level. Unilateral national action is no longer sufficient to ensure that our populations are protected. These new concerns do not mean, however, that we should indefinitely extend the rules of Community initiative and of qualified majority in this entire area. We believe that these developments do not necessarily mean that the Union’s procedures must all be produced or implemented in the same way. I am sure that it will be possible to take decisions on issues of Justice and Home Affairs by simplifying the structure of the pillars, without this changing the balance of the necessary cooperation between governments and national authorities in conjunction with the system of joint management developed by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Baroness Ludford is using her question to press for the abolition of the third pillar, the implementation of the codecision procedure and the inclusion of the Charter in the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This would make decision-making in the Council more democratic and more structured, because there has been a jumble of initiatives from the Member States recently. In addition to that, the legislative proposals of the Commission in the area of asylum and immigration are getting nowhere, because decision-making in the Council has come to a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism is justified. Part of the solution lies in a better treaty structure and the implementation of different decision-making procedures in certain areas. But I am still convinced that fussing about the powers at European level will not by definition improve the situation very much. Nor does a European constitution offer any added value. It is a pity that Parliament does not direct its attention to specific points from 2002 and always continues to focus on questions of powers and idealistic ideas about a European state.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from this, it remains for the Council to concern itself less with prestige and to spend more time on working to achieve results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It makes it possible for us, in accordance with Article 6 of the Council Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund, to take special steps in the event of a mass influx of refugees. What I now propose is that you, as representatives of the Commission and of the Council, make every conceivable preparation for such an eventuality, so that the Member States may not be left to their own devices, but may be supported in the manner provided for in Article 6. You should be allocating up to 80% of the funds required, but this requires that you take the necessary precautions right now. The Member States are to be urged to take the necessary precautions by appointing authorities to which the Commission may have recourse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am addressing both the Council and the Commission when I propose that consideration should be given to setting aside funds for eventual allocation to international aid organisations providing the relevant help on the spot, which should be the primary and most efficient form of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose, thirdly, that you should not leave the Member States to deal with this potentially tragic situation on their own, but should, in advance of events, give consideration to spreading the load of dealing with the people involved, as we know that a few countries were obliged to shoulder most of the burdens resulting from the crisis in the Balkans. We should be learning from our mistakes and preventing such a thing from recurring in future, so we should be preparing to apportion the people involved to individual Member States. I would very much like to know how, and to what extent, you envisage acting upon these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr von Boetticher, in the few parts of his speech that were any good, pointed out that we will, in future, have to do more legislative work if we are to achieve what we want, that being the bringing within the Community sphere of more aspects of the European Union currently covered by policy on the area of freedom, security and justice. In this sector, too, majority decision-making and the codecision procedure would have to be normative, with the Commission, rather than the Member States, having the right to initiate legislation. Very good! That is something I can only endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, that is how he thinks, then what is needed today is a sober inventory of the present situation, so that, if we want to overcome the challenges of the future, we are equipped to do so and able to fashion a policy that makes sense and will work.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the situation today? Commissioner Vitorino is thinking up something good. By making proposals, he is discharging the obligations laid on him by the scoreboard that he announced after Tampere. What he proposes goes too far for the Council, on the assumption that they actually read the stuff. The proposals then end up in Parliament, and Parliament adds to them and forwards them to the Council. What does the Council do? It throws them in the waste-paper basket. Such is the reality of the situation today. Now, I do not want to tread on the Council's toes. I am quite convinced that the Greek Presidency of the Council will read everything. Do not take what I say too personally.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need in future, though, is a different way of making laws, one in which the balance between the three institutions involved is safeguarded. This will involve all three bodies being willing to compromise. The Commission must be willing to compromise, as indeed it is, as all of us who know Commissioner Vitorino can tell you, even if he has to put up with being given an unjustified battering in the German press by young and rather immature MEPs. The Council's willingness to compromise is a matter of doubt, as the Council's policy is not – primarily, at any rate – guided by European standards, but by the demands of every single Member State's domestic policies. That is wrong. And thirdly, it is one of our institution's failings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats should prick up their ears and listen. I am now making them an offer, and this is the first time – but not, I hope, the last – that they will receive such an offer in this form. Let us talk together, so that we are not always coming up with the minimum of consensus, but can get the legislative work done. What are your demands, and what are ours? Where are you prepared to give some ground on your position, and where are we prepared to give some ground on our own? Where, then, can we achieve real compromises that make real law-making possible?</p>
<p class="contents">Business in this place has hitherto been conducted on the basis that anyone who is not on my side is against me, and that I will not vote with anyone who does not back up my position 100%, so this House ends up passing fortuitous texts by fortuitous majorities. If we want to do real legislative work, then I invite you to discuss compromise, but you will then have to demonstrate your capacity for it. This will involve you putting some of the hardliners in your ranks on the lead. But, Mr von Boetticher and Mr Pirker, being made of the stuff you are, I am sure you will manage that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not only in the last year that events have proved the opposite to be the case: repressive measures are enjoying a boom, with the European Union and its Member States forcing through controls on the EU's external borders no less than in its interior. On top of that, there is increased monitoring of personal data and of free communication. Biometric means are being used to evacuate privacy of any meaning. Finally, the EU's racist character is enhanced still further by the many laws aimed at so-called ‘foreigners’, with the introduction of the Eurodac system and the development of the Schengen Information System representing only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p class="contents">This security means, then, the greatest possible security for the State, whereas freedom would require a quite different policy – some would call it a more mature one – backing effective data protection, the demolition of Fortress Europe and the repeal of all racist special laws, including those on the right to citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Such, though, is not the case. What we are building here is a Union of state security, control and monitoring. Baroness Ludford's Liberalism, does not, unfortunately, extend to addressing any of these points in her question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Kingdom of Spain on 13 February 1983, that is to say 20 years ago, Joseba Arregi, a Basque political prisoner, died under torture while he was in police custody. That was 20 years ago tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, 634 politically motivated people were arrested. 127 of them subsequently claimed in court that they had suffered ill treatment or torture.</p>
<p class="contents">Have the Council and the Commission received clear information about this issue from the Spanish Government? Do the Council and the Commission consider that the transparency principle has been respected by the Spanish Government? Last year the Spanish Government proposed the banning of several social organisations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by Basque dissidents. Through a Spanish initiative, the European Union has drawn up a black list of associations and individuals accused of specific or tacit support for terrorism. The accused have neither the legal means of defence nor effective access to the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Do the Council and the Commission consider there to have been real enforcement of the democratic control principle with regard to Spain? Will the Council and the Commission put forward a judicial instrument in the new texts being prepared for those included on the European Union's black list?</p>

Mr President, I am not going to waste a single second – which is what he wants – so that I can defend what we have to defend: freedom, democracy and the area of freedom, security and justice. They are the enemies of freedom, security and justice in Europe. This must be stated categorically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the innovative aspect of what we are discussing here is that, at European Union level, we are providing protection for fundamental rights and for citizens’ rights. This protection, which is going to be enshrined in the new Treaty, is the fundamental condition for the success of the area of freedom, security and justice, and provides the foundation for the legitimisation of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, only by strengthening the protection of the rights and principles enshrined in the Rule of Law can we create the conditions for greater trust between the Member States and make it possible to produce genuinely common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, and following long delays, these policies are taking shape in the form of judicial, civil and criminal cooperation and are beginning to do so in the field of visas, asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of judicial cooperation, the European arrest warrant has opened up the way to direct cooperation between judges and has broken down barriers so that, amongst others, terrorists and murderers cannot find refuge in European territory for their criminal and violent activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must not forget this Parliament’s constant appeals in favour of protection and support for the victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of immigration and asylum, the progress made is not entirely satisfactory. Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the time limits established at the Seville European Council are respected. Any further delay would not only show a lack of solidarity between the Member States, but would also be a bad sign at a time when the Union is preparing for an historic enlargement. How can we resolve amongst 25 something which we have not able to decide amongst 15?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on the pointless complexity of the decision-making system within the area of freedom, security and justice. Parliament reflected this situation, in which decisions were adapted within the first or the third pillar, in a resolution in 1999. Today we are glad to discover that these same arguments have found consensus within the Convention charged with reforming the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice provides Parliament with a new opportunity to express its dissatisfaction and frustration with regard to the paralysis affecting the third pillar as a result of the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and despite the ongoing efforts of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Important Commission initiatives, both before and after 11 September 2001, remain deadlocked in Council or are still waiting to be transposed or ratified by the Member States. The States appear to wish to compensate for their inability to establish policies that will provide a structure for the area of freedom, security and justice by putting forward a torrent of proposals based on their right of initiative. As a rule, these proposals make a minuscule, if not counterproductive, contribution to the objectives that these States themselves have imposed on successive European summits.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing a procession of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that are not part of any plan or form part of the Commission scoreboard. These are arbitrary proposals of limited or no scope, incoherent, sometimes dictated by national political agendas, proposals that tend to turn the third pillar into a universe in chaos, continuously expanding in all directions - a legal and bureaucratic novel without full stops. The European Parliament has the duty to condemn this impasse, which is the result of the political inability to date of the Council and the Member States to have brought into force a single measure on the package on combating terrorism that has been drawn up by the Commission or come originally from it and planned in its scoreboard.</p>
<p class="contents">The gulf between the discourse of political leaders, in particular, of government representatives, and this resulting in practical actions is reaching scandalous proportions in the field of fighting transnational crime. Furthermore, in the areas covered by Title IV, we are still seeing a persistent imbalance, rightly condemned by the rapporteur, between the relative ease with which agreements are concluded on the repressive elements of controlling immigration and the ongoing inability to establish common policies in the field of asylum and regulating legal immigration, specifically in the field of civil rights and social integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposals for a European arrest warrant and for a framework decision on terrorism that have already been referred to, for example, are proof of the Union’s ability to implement the objectives set by the Treaty of Amsterdam when the need to act is combined with the will to do so. Nevertheless, and despite the progress that has been made, as Baroness Ludford has already observed and as was also stated at Laeken, I quote, ‘new boosts and new guidelines are needed to make good the delay seen in certain areas’.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand considerable progress has been made in stepping up cooperation between the agencies responsible for implementing the law on the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, on the European arrest warrant and on harmonising criminal and anti-terrorist legislation. On the other, much still remains to be done in order to achieve a practical and effective system for safeguarding citizens’ rights. It cannot be emphasised too much, as indeed Commissioner Vitorino emphasised, that it is crucial to maintain a balance between the three components of the same concept, which together constitute the area of freedom, security and justice. In other words, there can be no security without freedom and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another source of regret, as various speakers have said today, is the excessively frequent use of the right of initiative by the Member States, who have increased the number of proposals that this Parliament has felt obliged to reject because they lack coherence, clarity and even usefulness and which were only guided by the requirements of national politics or to placate the media. Furthermore, the imposition of matters pertaining to the first pillar and of means that fall under the third pillar has been an ongoing source of difficulties. Decisions need to be taken, especially in areas such as data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Europol and Eurojust, it is regrettable that there is still only an indirect democratic division of responsibility, which is fragmented and insufficiently limited. To conclude, Mr President, the reduced level of democratic legitimacy that we are still seeing is also a matter of regret. Parliament is rarely consulted and often on political agreements that have already been concluded in Council, which means that our contribution is an irrelevant and useless document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that this is what concerns the citizens of Europe. The points made basically reflect what the citizens of Europe expect of us in the old and the new Europe. In the Europe we are all now building together.</p>
<p class="contents">I noticed that many of the views highlighted the need for a balance between the measures taken, which of course need to be taken for the security of the citizens in Europe, and the need to protect citizens’ rights and freedoms. The points made by the honourable Members reinforced my own view that greater security must not mean cutting back and compromising on freedoms. Besides, individual freedoms and human rights are elements of our European legal culture. We must not shift the centre of gravity one way or the other, because security is clearly an inalienable right and a primordial right for every citizen; but nor must we shift the centre of gravity and risk cutting back or overlooking and compromising on human rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasised and I repeat that, during the course of the Greek Presidency, we shall be focusing on striking this necessary balance, which is also why, as I said in my statement, we have included specific issues to do with freedoms, including the freedoms of suspects and defendants, on the agenda for the informal Council. And, by the way, the second item we shall of course be discussing at the informal Council is an issue which directly interests all of us at the moment: the future of Europe and the continuing debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate will, I am sure, bring about something we are all hoping for: a stronger role for the European Parliament, so that it can make a more material contribution to the decisions taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also particularly interested in the honourable Members’ comments that measures must be taken to guard borders at European level. We all want to find a way of protecting, guarding and controlling Europe’s borders, by which I mean the external borders of the European Union. This applies especially to my country, which holds the Presidency for these six months and which has a special significance by reason of its geographical position and the particular configuration of its borders. What I mean is we have a certain amount of experience here. One of the topics being discussed, and which will continue to be discussed, is how to apportion the burden. We need to find a way of apportioning the burden fairly at European level so that we can strengthen our border controls. Obviously, we need to be able to prevent a mass influx of illegal immigrants, because mass illegal immigration makes things worse and creates even more problems within the European Union. It even exacerbates the position of immigrants already in the European Union. However, this does not mean that we should not pay greater attention to the rights of immigrants already in the European Union or that their rights are less important to us. Europe already has decades of experience in admitting immigrants and it is time it did something to speed up its ability to integrate immigrants already in Europe smoothly and more quickly, by which I mean integrate them into the society of the host state.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close with a brief reply to a question about whether there is a risk of a mass influx of refugees in the wake of possible events in Iraq. There is, I think, a daily risk of a mass influx of refugees from countries outside the European Union and this is being discussed in the relevant committees. I think that we need Community financial support and we need to spread the burden fairly, irrespective of what happens in Iraq. Of course we all hope that developments will not result in situations which give rise to another mass influx of refugees arriving in the European Union. In other words, we hope to maintain peace and not to have to face awkward situations which, as we all know, apart from any other adverse repercussions, give rise to waves of immigrants.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall just address a few of the questions raised during the debate, starting with a remark by Mr Schulz. We should all resist the temptation to reduce the debate on asylum and migration to a purely ideological debate. It is indeed tempting and very easy to do this by using slogans to manipulate emotions. However, if we reduce the debate to such positions, I wonder whether we are really addressing the dramatic problems that asylum and migration raise for thousands of people all over the world and especially in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It might even be tempting to make the Commission the bad guy. I am used to performing several roles, but this would be a new one for me. However, the Commission has always tried to put forward the right balance between an efficient policy combating illegal migration and, at the same time, defining the grass roots of a proactive, positive policy on migration. This is not for ideological reasons. We believe that if we do not succeed in having a clear, transparent and coordinated policy on legal migration, we will not succeed in the fight against trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">If I appear too generous, I would like to recall that the Commission put forward a proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings. The Commission presented the action plan on illegal migration that was taken on board by the Council. The Commission presented the action plan on external border controls that was taken on board by the Council. The Commission presented the proposal on the return action plan. The Commission made the proposal on a new Schengen information system. The Commission proposed the creation of a visa database. If this is being too generous, I admit that I have some differences with some Members regarding the notion of generosity.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the new terrorist threat, as Mr Queiró has emphasised, we recognise that we are confronted with a phenomenon we know little about. We are not yet at the stage of being prepared to face the new profile of the terrorist threat, not only as far as the possibility of terrorist attacks is concerned - and one must be prepared for whatever might happen in the near future, in the light of the evolution of international events - but also in terms of a key question you have raised: the financing of the terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I hope that during 2003, Member States will be able to make effective progress in achieving concrete results and adopt legislation to combat the financing of terrorism. This should include not only the illegal financing of terrorism, but also the 'legal' financing of terrorism in the European Union, including offshore centres on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm to Mrs Terrón i Cusí that the Commission intends to set up a network of experts during spring 2003, thus following up the Brussels Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the issue raised by Mr Coehlo. Difficulties abound in dealing with certain specific and very sensitive issues because we have a split between the first and third pillars; data protection is a very good example of this. We should emphasise that there is a clear sign from the European Convention that the values of freedom, security and justice cannot be held hostage by a schizophrenic division between pillars that is blocking us every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the very important issue raised by Mr Pirker, I can guarantee that we are preparing for the possibility of a mass influx. I do not want to anticipate the evolution of international events, but we have learned much from the experience in Kosovo. We have the directive on temporary protection. It has been transposed into national legislation by Sweden, Finland and Belgium, and other Member States already have provisions in their national legislation concerning sudden influxes of migrants and refugees. Therefore, to deal with the most urgent situations we can mobilise, in the very short term, the reserve of the fund for European refugees. My colleague, Commissioner Nielson, together with ECHO, and in close coordination with UNHCR, is looking at the possibility of supporting refugees in the region. I hope that this time things will work much better, thanks to the progress that has been achieved as far as temporary protection is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay my sincere respects to Parliament. If we have problems in terms of progress during this year Parliament cannot be blamed for any kind of delay. It has always given its opinions on time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
