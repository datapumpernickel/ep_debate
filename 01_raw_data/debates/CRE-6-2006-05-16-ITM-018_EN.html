<p class="contents">The adoption of this proposal by the European legislature creates a new, solid legal basis for the financing of European standardisation. European standardisation has already played an outstanding role in supporting European policy for more than 20 years. For example, it has made a major contribution towards the completion of the internal market. As part of the New Approach, standardisation complements European legislation and contributes to technical harmonisation, enabling unrestricted trade in goods within the EU. More than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach, a concrete example of which is the Machinery Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Standardisation is also an important tool for realising the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. In view of the positive experience with standards in connection with internal market legislation, there are plans to use the approach of reference to voluntary standards in other areas of law, too, within the framework of what is known as ‘better lawmaking’. Examples are legislation in the fields of environmental protection, control of foodstuffs and the energy and transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, standardisation has the potential to play an important role in strengthening the competitiveness of European industry, as it facilitates interoperability between different technologies, paves the way for the introduction of new technologies and promotes innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, European standardisation receives financial support from the Commission on the basis of legal acts from the 1980s. In view of the development of budgetary rules, it is imperative to update the legal basis for the financing of standardisation. The budgetary resources for financing European standardisation must be approved annually within the framework of the budgetary procedure. These currently amount to EUR 19 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The beneficiaries of Community financing are the European standardisation organisations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, which are listed in Annex I of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations. Under special circumstances, support may also be given to other authorities in respect of activities necessary to support European standardisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the discussions, many parties called for European standardisation to take sufficient account of all the relevant interests, such as those of consumers, environmental protection and small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission shares this view and is working towards improving the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision is not intended to guarantee the financing of the individual interests concerned, however. I should like to point out in this connection that support is provided for the participation of experts, for example from SMEs, within the framework of our SME programme. The same goes for the involvement of consumer and environmental protection and occupational health and safety stakeholders. It is also the responsibility of Member States to guarantee sufficient participation of the relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission expressly welcomes the amendments drawn up in cooperation between Parliament and the Council. We can support all of Parliament’s amendments. I should like to express my particular thanks once again to Parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts to make agreement possible at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why does a sheet of A4 fit into an envelope? Why do SIM cards work in all mobile phones? Why would it be helpful to have identical power points throughout the European Union? Once things like this function smoothly, they are so self-evident that we hardly notice them.</p>
<p class="contents">For such apparently simple things to happen, however, requires serious thought on somebody’s part, and this ‘somebody’ is the European standardisation system, which is made up of three European and 29 national standards organisations, and more than 60 000 experts. They draft European standards, which are agreed by consensus and are based on voluntary agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the main function of common European standards is to remove technical barriers to trade and to promote the internal market, standardisation policy should be regarded a cornerstone of EU policy for meeting the targets of the revised Lisbon Strategy. For 20 years now European standardisation has, thanks mainly to the directives known as the ‘new approach’, greatly streamlined European legislation. Directives drawn up in the context of the new approach apply only to basic safety requirements, consumer protection and environmental protection. Technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards. This, Commissioner Verheugen, is the correct way to achieve good European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">When I worked as an architect, standards were a tool I used in my work. They provided me with a point of reference in designing, assessing and approving buildings. This was one of the reasons why I accepted the assignment of reporting to the European Parliament with a proposal to the European Commission on financing European standardisation. The aim of this decision is to put in place a consolidated legal framework for providing this financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though European standardisation is necessary for the functioning of the internal market, there has as yet been no legislative basis dedicated specifically to financing it. The EU’s contribution towards financing European standards is currently 2%, while national organisations contribute approximately 5%, and enterprises 93%, primarily by providing expertise. The Member States have their roles to play in technical standardisation, in that they have to ensure the adoption of European standards by the national systems. I am pleased that my country, Slovakia, has been among the quickest to transpose European standards thanks to the Slovak Technical Standards Act.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that European standardisation is a system that will help to create a favourable business environment. Business representatives and other interested parties are becoming increasingly aware of the role technical standardisation plays in the business world. It must be a priority for Parliament to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises, and in particular micro-enterprises and trades enterprises are able to effectively use European standards. It is in the interest of the Union to contribute financially to the translation of these standards into all official languages, to make them equally and transparently accessible, in particular to small enterprises in the new Member States which lack the financial and human resources to translate specialist standards. It would be helpful for handbooks to be available to SMEs explaining the standards to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The seven-month discussions between Parliament, the European Commission, the Council and other interested organisations have convinced me that this problem has taken its rightful place in EU policy. In the approval process I supported all proposed amendments which helped to improve the Commission’s proposal. I am pleased with the enormous amount of assistance from all rapporteurs, and in particular the shadow rapporteur Edit Herzog and Paul Rübich, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy rapporteur who was asked to give an opinion. Please allow me also to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their exemplary assistance and their wish to find a consensus right from the outset, allowing a financial framework for European standardisation to be found at the first reading. In conclusion I would like to express my conviction that my report and the support that Parliament has shown for it will lead to adequate financing for European standardisation, which will contribute to a simpler and safer life for all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For two years now, the European Commission has been seeking to develop standardisation in the context of health, social, societal and environmental services. It proposes to make wider use of standardisation work in the field of services, while preserving the monopolistic nature of the bodies mentioned in the report – which is, in my opinion, regrettable – even though standardisation has been mainly focused up to now on industrial products and nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards, when viewed in the specific context of services, tend to be substituted for the harmonisation of European legislation, which is worrying. However necessary, indeed essential, standardisation may be, it cannot take precedence over legislation. These standards are required in all European invitations to tender but, until now, they have been drawn up exclusively by manufacturers, without any democratic control, and may accordingly constitute an obstacle to market access, which is something that we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important to ensure, in particular, that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies. That obviously includes manufacturers, but it also includes consumer associations, clients, local authority representatives or even environmental protection associations. The compromise amendments certainly address this concern, but only to a very small extent.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I felt that, insofar as public funds were involved, the European Parliament had to be informed each year of the standardisation process that had actually been implemented. European standards organisations are actually associations of general interest in receipt of public aid from the Community. As such, they must obviously meet obligations with regard to transparency. The compromise amendment regarding this issue makes provision for a Commission assessment of standardisation activities to be carried out at least once every five years, which is clearly not often enough.</p>
<p class="contents">So there you have my observations summed up in a few words, Madam President. I should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the rapporteur and the coordinators on the quality of the work done, but I deplore the insufficient efforts made to encourage greater plurality and regret that the assessments of standardisation activities should be so infrequent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen, however, as he has managed, by way of better regulation, to create a new instrument – namely European standardisation – to enable the objective to be achieved faster and more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we are currently addressing the issue of mobile TV: the problem of Nokia versus LG standardisation. European standards should be created for this as quickly as possible to enable us to take the lead in the global market. Another example is the allocation of frequencies in the linear-digital field. If carried out quickly, efficiently and well, standardisation offers prospects of gaining market shares in this field. A further example is mobile-telephone chargers: here, too, there is a lack of standardisation. The need for action on this is tremendous, and dramatic progress could be achieved by means of economies of scale.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I am also pleased that particular attention is being paid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and I believe that the next thing we need is a Green Paper on standardisation. This would enable our economy to achieve the Lisbon criteria significantly faster and more efficiently by means of standardisation that is accepted worldwide – one of the best examples of this being the GSM system. A Green Paper in this field could give us the opportunity of demonstrating where our future opportunities lie. This represents a challenge. Parliament is already pleased to note that its cooperation with the Commission on this is as constructive as ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that it will be the first of many. I am really delighted that she has taken on this role. It is entirely appropriate that, coming from one of the new Member States most active in the field of the internal market, she has not only blazed a trail for Members from Slovakia, but also has the moral authority to carry this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the internal market scoreboard, you will see that top of the list of countries that have transposed internal market legislation and adopted European standards are the new Member States. They are putting all the old Member States to shame in that respect. So I believe that she has done outstanding work here. I am also delighted that we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission in pre-conciliation to get this important package through at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some of the issues. I have to take issue with the spokesman from the Committee on Budgets, who has totally misunderstood what this is all about. As you said, Commissioner, it is largely about the development of effective technical standards for products. That is one of your crucial responsibilities in the new allocation of portfolios in the Commission. But we must not forget that this is all part of the total development of the internal market. We are now on the verge of a very important review of the future of the internal market. I share the view of my colleague, Mr Rübig, that the role of standardisation bodies is crucial in making that market work better. We still have problems where those standards are not being recognised by Member States. It is still too difficult for manufacturers to take advantage of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask the limited number of people here how we are going to create jobs and growth in the European economy if we cannot get the internal market to work properly; if we cannot engage all the tools and weapons at our disposal. I was really pleased that the President of the Commission, in the statement that he made this week about delivery for our citizens, put the completion of the internal market absolutely at the top of the list. That is where it should be. If we cannot make the internal market work, what else have we got to do to achieve success in the global economy? Standards are part of that, not just in Europe but also in the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteurs say in one of their amendments – and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Herczog, for her work – we want to ensure fair and transparent access to European standards for all market players throughout the Union. That is what this proposal is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is interesting that the questions raised here are always those that have been followed by the same MEPs every night.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mrs Pleštinská on her first report. Like Mr Harbour, I, too, hope that she will draft many more reports in the next three years, during the time that we are MEPs here together. I would like to thank her for the very friendly environment she created both in the Committee on the Internal Market and in the course of the talks and negotiations with the Council, enabling us to reach an agreement. This environment enabled us to reach an agreement on every issue following the first reading, and hopefully everyone will be able to support the amendment proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I need to make another brief comment. Mr Harbour said that new Member States are at the top of the list in transposing internal market regulations. At this point we need to remember the work of Commissioner Verheugen in this area, because without him we would never have been able to do this so efficiently. At that time he was responsible for the enlargement of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the report, I think that the most important result we have achieved is that by starting this European financing, we are better able to ensure the improved operation of the internal market and clean competition for each market player and interested party; also, we have managed to achieve this without creating too much bureaucracy or, God forbid, a new institution, which we are so keen on doing. I personally like the approach of trying to increase the efficiency of the work of existing institutions that already operate efficiently, and making it available to everybody, using a relatively low amount of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The law in the process of being adopted ensures equal opportunities for companies in respect of Community assistance allocation and the handling of public funds, also ensuring an open and transparent procedure, while – and I emphasise it again: this is extremely important to us in view of the Better Regulation Programme – it prevents unnecessary bureaucracy. Personally, I feel that this is the greatest result achieved by this amendment proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to mention that the appropriate and competent Community assistance provided for standardisation is not an expenditure, but a clear investment. It is an investment in the better operation of the internal market, in the enhancement of European competitiveness, in the information, protection and increased safety of consumers using standard products and services, and in the improvement of the market situation and chances of small and medium-sized enterprises, even if – and I completely agree with the Commissioner here – this law is not meant to support small entrepreneurs individually.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude once more for the cooperation of all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work together in connection with this law, and my wish is that we will have many other laws like this, and that REACH, in particular, will follow along the same lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European standardisation complements key European policy objectives by establishing a consensus between economic operators, and has now managed to establish itself in approximately 20 industry sectors. This has considerably simplified the process of making goods and services on the internal market both comparable and compatible, and so the Commission’s financial support and continuing development of European standardisation warrants our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The catalogue of the three European standardisation bodies, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, now numbers more than 15 000 standards and other European specifications. This standardisation work has often rendered detailed Community legislation in the areas concerned superfluous, and it is sometimes possible to avoid legislation altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, standardisation should be seen as an integral part of the continuing efforts towards better lawmaking and thus as part of a policy for growth and employment. In addition to the internal market aspect, European standardisation has the potential to support a whole range of Community policy measures capable of increasing the competitiveness of European enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies in particular to the fields of trade policy, transport, the environment and security of travel documents. In the field of research and technological development, clear common standards are needed as a source of technical expertise and as a market instrument. As with GSM and Galileo, which have already been mentioned by some fellow Members, it is thus possible to create a common trading language.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this positive assessment, European standardisation and its institutional framework need to be improved and strengthened. The provisions of the new Financial Regulation require the creation of a clear, complete, detailed legal basis for European standardisation. I believe that the compromise proposal is capable of meeting these requirements. All the actors involved deserve thanks for their constructive cooperation, particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Pleštinská.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be recommending that my group support the compromise reached, and am confident that agreement will be reached here as early as at first reading. Incidentally, I believe that we should be holding this debate, too, in Brussels and not in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the introduction of the European standard for playgrounds in 1997, for example, the rate of children’s injuries fell by more than 25% in Austria. The aim of this directive is not to set up a new office, but to introduce a legal framework for systematically financing standardisation offices and agencies. There are many reasons for proper financing, but I would like to mention just one. The offices for standardisation have very limited national budgets in the new Member States compared to Germany, France or the United Kingdom, and they must also carry the burden of translation costs. This is because standards are incorporated everywhere into national law, but for the new Member States they are available only in English, German or French. Small firms, of course, do not have the resources for time-consuming translations. So if we want to ensure that all businesses make use of these worthwhile standards, they must be made available in all of the official languages. You will surely agree that it is in the interests of the European Community to contribute financially towards the cost of these translations.</p>
<p class="contents">I value the Commission’s proposal highly. The rapporteur has, moreover, made some valuable additions to it which will, for example, assist small and medium-sized enterprises. She also proposes measures that will increase control and transparency in respect of the new financing. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Pleštinská. I appreciate in particular the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of this report, and I would note that she has played an important role in the drafting of a well thought-out and non-controversial proposal that will serve the citizens of Europe well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, therefore, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur, and wish to offer her my sincere congratulations on the difficult work she has done. As deputy coordinator, I believe that this represents an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow’s vote is the result of an informal trialogue aimed at bringing the issue of the financing of European standardisation to a successful conclusion at first reading. I believe that the compromise that the rapporteur has achieved is a respectable one. In spite of all the positive aspects pointed out here by various Members, however, I would venture to make a criticism, an objection.</p>
<p class="contents">Frequent experience has shown that the economy, which is the main beneficiary from the harmonisation of the EU internal market, participates in these rules, and indisputably has urgent need of them, and therefore we MEPs must support this process. Yet experience has also shown that many citizens – and many mayors or other economic actors – are not seeing these rules the way they were intended. There are some rules, such as the pre-standard on the prevention of crime by urban planning and building design, to which mayors are objecting – not entirely unjustifiably, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">That was why I welcomed the rapporteur’s original proposal for the costs of standardisation to be oriented to a much greater extent towards the costs actually incurred. Owing to past experience, however, this proposal could not be pushed through in the agreement with the Council and the Commission. Nevertheless, I believe that it is perfectly appropriate for us MEPs to ensure that standardisation really has parliamentary legitimacy where the public is affected, and can also really be achieved by self-administration where only economic actors are concerned. In this respect, I hope that we can make progress with these issues, too, within the framework of the Internal Market Strategy – with which not only the Commission but undoubtedly Parliament, too, will be concerned in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European standardisation has an important role to play in removing technical barriers to trade, and thereby promoting the development of the European single market. Technical standards replace detailed legislative provisions and simplify the rules, which will at the end of the day make the entire European economy more competitive. Defining mandatory basic requirements will also ensure a high degree of protection for consumers, health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Standardisation is indispensable in sectors such as health care, transport, telecommunications or electrical engineering. In the health care sector, for instance, there are some 10 000 different medical devices, and in this field European standards play an important regulatory role. Whilst setting out detailed definitions of the requirements for ensuring a high level of patient safety, they also encourage innovation. More than 80% of companies operating in this area are SMEs, which is why we appreciate the rapporteur’s efforts to ensure equal access to European standards for this group of players.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1985, when the ‘new approach’ to European standards was adopted, more than 15 000 standards have been issued. The European Union, however, makes only a minor contribution to the overall financing of European standardisation, even though studies have shown that the benefits to the economy far outweigh the costs. For this reason it is important for the EU to provide a sizeable portion of the finance for the entire system not just within the European Union, but also on an international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can regard technical standardisation as a binding component for development in many fields, such as research, industry, the economy and health care, and above all in the common interest, as it serves everyone, even if that is not immediately obvious. We only realise how important standards are when something does not work properly. I remember how the new Member States recently had to rebuild their technical systems. In Slovakia that meant revising more than 25 000 technical standards, scrapping almost half of them and incorporating 15 000 national standards into the remainder, all of which required a lot of investment. We must underline the great contribution to this made by the internationally recognised and long-established Slovak Standards Institute.</p>
<p class="contents">We now face the considerable task of improving the financing for European standardisation in support of the competitiveness of European industry in particular, and of European policy on global competition. For this reason this decision is of the utmost importance. To construct, coordinate and further refine a complex and extensive mechanism of technical standards which functions dynamically requires clear, rational and adequate financial support.</p>

<p class="contents">This is very important, as technical standardisation is something that, astonishingly, is frequently entirely misjudged in the mind of the European public. We have all seen how certain standards have been seized on in the public political debate as bizarre examples of ‘excessive European regulation’. It has been rightly pointed out this evening that the European public would be very surprised if this instrument did not exist, as our daily lives could no longer function without it, nor could most economic sectors. It is a very modern instrument and, from a legal point of view, a very flexible one and the instrument of choice. Indeed, the question should be asked – and here I refer to a remark by the rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, with which I disagree – whether it is always necessary to bring in the legislative big guns – laws, in other words – straight away when we want to regulate something, or whether putting responsibility for technical standards in the hands of those who need them, and merely laying down a policy guideline stating that a rule is necessary, would perhaps take much greater account of our own society’s right to freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to announce to you once more this evening my political intent to use the experience we have gained with the New Approach over the last 20 years to extend this modern instrument of European legislation to other fields of the internal market and to other policies, too.</p>
