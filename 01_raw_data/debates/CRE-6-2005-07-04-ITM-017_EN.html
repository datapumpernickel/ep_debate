<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kurt Joachim Lauk (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to make a number of comments on the European Central Bank’s annual report. Perhaps I might begin with the general observation that the report is agreeably presented and is worth reading. What is particularly pleasing is that various sections are clearly distinguished from each other, and that complex financial matters are discussed in readily accessible language. This makes it possible for the subject matter to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the substance of the report, I will start by saying – and I am glad that the President of the ECB is here to hear me say this – that the Bank has, overall, acted throughout a difficult year with a great deal of acumen. In the first half of the year, there was evidence of slight growth, with inflation expected in the medium and longer term, whilst the opposite happened in the second six months. Mid-year, the ECB was generally successful in resisting the temptation to raise interest rates, opting instead to keep them stable.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year was not only a year in which we experienced price stability, but also one of ten in which the global economy grew by an average of 3.7%. The only sad thing is that Europe has cut itself off from this growth. As the ECB itself points out, poor economic growth is not least the result of the Member States’ failure to make the structural reforms that are necessary, and cannot therefore be blamed on the ECB, which, contrariwise, points out that the Member States need to shoulder more responsibility in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it very important to note that the ECB has in fact delivered itself of a number of brief but clear and notable statements on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. While the debate on this subject is at an end, and we do not have to have a re-run of it today, we should be clear in our own minds about the consequences. As a result of the new agreement, the criteria have lost their rigour, and this weakens the ECB. As a result of responsibility for stability having been returned to the Member States, its job has become more difficult in three areas in particular: it has become immensely more difficult to maintain discipline in the Member States, firstly as regards the size of the national budgets, secondly in terms of the way in which the state’s functions and outgoings are structured, and, thirdly, as regards the structure of tax revenue. What that means is that the greater laxity with which the Stability and Growth Pact is applied has enabled the Member States to achieve a <span class="italic">de facto</span> renationalisation of responsibility and hence, in fact, to make it more difficult for the Bank to do its job.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB advocates the use of the preventive mechanism. It is very much an indictment of the Member States that they were unable, in good times, to strengthen the preventive mechanism; that is now a matter of necessity. While the Bank is in favour of this, it also warns against the corrective aspect of the Pact being weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we have to consider the issue of enlargement. The ECB guaranteed that the integration of the ten new Member States would proceed without a hitch. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia have been part of the European exchange rate mechanism since 28 June 2004, and were joined on 2 May 2005 by Latvia, Malta and Cyprus. One explicit demand that we make of the ECB is that, reform of the Stability and Growth Pact notwithstanding, the Maastricht criteria should continue to apply unchanged when countries join the single currency in future, and that there be no laxity in insisting on them. When countries join the single currency in future, the situation that we had with Greece and its statistics must be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final request of the ECB is that its information policy, which is generally good, be further improved, for there is room for improvement. We welcome the publication of statistical information and the increased regularity with which it appears. Dialogue with the Bank is good, although one might well admit in private that there is plenty of room for improvement and that it could happen on a more regular basis. We do, however, urge the Bank to follow the US Federal Reserve’s example and publish something along the lines of its <span class="italic">Beige Book </span>in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that last year saw the ECB taking a great stride towards the clearing of payments and the settlement of securities. The Target II system is up and running, facilitating automated real-time high-speed fund transfers across Europe, and hence opening up the way to universal real-time settlement in the Central Bank’s currency. This would in turn open up the possibility of a single system in Europe rather than a patchwork. The ECB has shown boldness in taking the necessary steps to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is complete in itself, and so I ask that it be adopted as it stands and the amendments that have been submitted rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jules Maaten (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made this debate on the communication strategy on the euro rather broader and turned it into a discussion of the euro’s current state and what we should actually do with it. After all, this debate is taking place at a time when the entire political debate on Europe is under pressure, something to which I do not think we can afford to close our eyes. I believe that many of us, certainly myself included, at the time when the euro was introduced in 1999, and especially in 2002, had the feeling that it would bring Europe closer to its citizens, who – certainly those in the euro zone – would be clutching Europe in their hands on a daily basis and would thereby be helped to have a sense of closer connection with it. I think that it has to be said, though, that this has not been the case. Not only in my own country, but also in other countries in the euro zone or countries that could join, I have seen that the euro has, in some cases, proven to be a millstone. This is something which I very much regret, but it is a conclusion that we have had to draw.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, in actual fact, a crazy situation in the light of how well the euro is functioning, There are cheaper financing options available, the interest rates are lower than ever, which promotes investments and consumption and offers the consumer real benefits, for example in the shape of low interest rates on mortgages and cheaper loans. The ECB’s stricter approach to managing monetary policy has brought increased price transparency, and hence a stable environment for the euro and low inflation. Just look at the success stories of the countries involved in the 2001-2002 switch, where inflation was only 2.3%.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has given the economies in the euro zone increased resilience against financial crisis. Without the euro, 11 September 2003, 11 March 2004 or indeed the 2002 accountancy scandals would have caused far greater turbulence. That has not happened. We owe this to the euro. The exchange rate risk has been removed, travelling within the euro zone has become easier, all kinds of paperwork has become redundant, as well as the cost involved in exchanging currencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers benefit from the strong euro. Raw materials and oil on the global market are paid in dollars and the favourable exchange rate, in any case up to the referenda in France and the Netherlands, has resulted in relatively low fuel and food prices for European consumers. Trade has increased within the European Union: 10% across the board and 17% in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Austria. I have not even mentioned the fact that the euro commands great respect on the international financial markets, as is evident from its important role as an international reserve currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all these successes – and I think that this shows that the euro may well be one of the EU’s most successful, if not <span class="italic">the</span> most successful, project to date – we notice that many regular consumers do not seem to be in agreement with us. That means that we have a big problem comparable to that we encountered in the debate on the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">To what is this attributable? I think, above all, to the problem of inflation. Mr Trichet, in our monetary dialogue of 14 March, you said something I thought was very valid. I think that because we did not communicate well with the public about inflation, we lost some credibility in countries where the euro has now been introduced. I notice in contacts with citizens that this is nearly beyond repair. When I say: ‘Inflation has been very limited’, the response is ‘you are lying’. When I say: ‘yes, but there are statistical offices and Eurostat that can back this up’, they respond: ‘yes, but they are lying too’. Credibility is in short supply. It appears that we were unable to explain how inflation, which was real in 2002, has disappeared. Consumers were not born yesterday. Since we failed to explain to them what caused this inflation, everything is dumped on the euro. We have only ourselves, with all our institutions, to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all exacerbated, of course, by all the commotion surrounding the Stability Pact, and so I am delighted with the amendment on that subject from the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has also tabled a sound amendment relating to the carry-on surrounding the ongoing failure of the Lisbon process to get off the ground. It is important that we should solve these problems, because the new Member States will soon be joining the euro. I think the report has been improved by the large number of amendments that have been tabled on this subject, also in the committee and by the Members from the new Member States. It is important that we strike the right note with them when the euro is introduced in those countries, but also with the citizens of the Member States currently in the eurozone, for it is their verdict that we will have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the reason why I would ask the European Central Bank to submit reports to us annually – not to talk only in bankers’ jargon and in economic terms about how well the euro is doing, but also about what the euro has really meant for ordinary consumers. It is unfortunate that, according to the ECB, or at least to Mr González Páramo’s letter to me, this would entail a huge number of methodological problems. I appreciate that this may be the case, and this letter was also written before the current crisis. I would still appreciate it greatly if the European Central Bank were to reconsider this request. Speaking personally, I would not mind if the Commission were to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to think ‘the euro is there, we have to put up with it now’. The responsible citizen refuses to accept this. It is a problem that we can solve. Given the way in which you, Mr Trichet, always come across to the committee, I think that you are ideally placed to solve that problem and, above all, that we – Parliament, the ECB and the Commission – would be able to do this quite easily if we joined forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Central Bank is aware of the crucial importance of its democratic responsibility and has always stressed that its independence must go hand in hand with a strict obligation to justify its actions. The ECB therefore attaches the utmost importance to holding regular dialogues with the elected representatives of the European citizens. Allow me to say that I listened with the greatest interest to Mr Lauk’s report and to Mr Maaten’s report. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> (DE)</span> In my introductory remarks, I shall first review the economic and monetary developments in 2004 and set out our view of our economic prospects and of the monetary policy strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall then have something to say about a number of comments and proposals in the draft report on the ECB Annual Report for 2004. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> (FR) </span>Allow me to begin with the economic and monetary issues. </p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 the ECB’s monetary policy operated in an environment of gradual economic recovery in the euro area. Real GDP growth for the year as a whole stood at 1.8 %, compared with 0.5 % in the previous year. During the first half of 2004 economic activity showed relatively dynamic growth. In the second half, however, economic growth was only modest, partly on account of rising oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards price developments, underlying domestic inflationary pressures in the euro area remained contained, reflecting subdued increases in labour compensation and well-anchored inflation expectations. While the appreciation of the euro exchange rate in 2004 contributed to lower inflationary pressures, increases in administered prices, indirect taxes and rises in the oil price visibly affected headline inflation rates. Overall, the annual HICP inflation was 2.1 %, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of subdued domestic price pressure and a favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term, key ECB interest rates remained unchanged throughout the year at historically low levels. Interest rates remained low over the entire maturity spectrum, thereby lending considerable support to economic activity. As a matter of fact, our long-term rates are at their lowest level for 100 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fiscal developments in the euro area in 2004 were, as has been said by the rapporteur, far from satisfactory. The average fiscal deficit in the euro area broadly stabilised at 2.7 % of GDP. This is a level which not only implies a rising debt ratio which could become unsustainable, but also leaves little safety margin for short-term budgetary relief in the event of adverse developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact continued in 2004, resulting in a report adopted in March 2005. The budget implementation in 2005 and the preparation of the budget for 2006 both provide the first opportunities for all parties involved to rigorously implement the provisions of the Pact, so as to show that the Pact remains an effective framework for fiscal policy coordination and discipline. As the rapporteur said, everybody in this Parliament knows what was the ECB’s position throughout these discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, 2004 saw significant revisions of past deficits and debt figures in a few countries, undermining the effectiveness of EU fiscal surveillance. It is of vital importance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the crucial issue of structural reforms, the ECB welcomes and supports the renewed impetus for economic reform as a result of the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, its stronger focus on growth and employment, and the new governance framework aimed at improving the delivery of reforms. The new Integrated Guidelines for 2005-2008, comprising both the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new Employment Guidelines, should now set the stage for concrete action at EU level and by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now say a few words about monetary policy in a vast and diversified euro area. The magnitude of inflation dispersion across euro-area countries is similar to the dispersion observed in the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas. In a monetary union inflation and labour-cost differentials across regions or countries are the natural way of adjusting relative prices in the face of asymmetric demand or supply developments. Such adjustments within the euro area have been larger and more frequent than anticipated. From that standpoint the euro area is more flexible than had been expected by many observers. Whilst generally adjustments of relative prices are economically justified, there are cases where inflation differentials may be due to inappropriate national economic policies and rigidities in labour and product markets. For these countries structural reforms are very highly advisable.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to note, whilst listening to the rapporteur, that you share our view that the regular dialogue is a very important part of the overall framework. The ECB is grateful for the suggestions made by the European Parliament and considers them with great care. In this respect, I can report that last year the ECB decided that it would henceforth publish its Financial Stability Review, in line with a proposal made by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that on many important issues the views expressed in the motion for a resolution are very close to those held by the ECB, such as the statements regarding the ECB’s monetary policy conduct in 2004 and the diagnosis that the relative weakness of economic activity can be attributed to lack of structural reform. Your position with regard to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was also very close to the ECB’s views in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the motion for a resolution compliments us for the work we undertook to prepare for the enlargement of the European Union, which marked another milestone towards an ever closer Union. The thorough preparations for this enlargement enabled the smooth entry of the ten new national central banks into the ESCB. We share your view on this particular point that the best possible preparation for adopting the euro is a high level of sustainable convergence, in accordance with the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are many topics on which we entirely share the views expressed in the motion for a resolution, there are some issues where we have a slightly different opinion. The motion for a resolution urged the ECB to consider the publication of 'summary minutes'. Yet I must say we continue to see great advantages in the communication channels chosen by the ECB. The approach chosen by the ECB to communicate its monetary policy decisions to the public almost in real time facilitates expectation formation and thus enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy. The ECB approach has achieved a high degree of monetary policy predictability and has allowed long-term inflation expectations to be anchored at healthy levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We have provided the European Parliament with extensive and up-to-date information through various channels and stand ready to continue to do so as regards the very important question of clearing and settlement. Should a directive on clearing and settlement be adopted at a later stage, these standards would have to be amended accordingly, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also tell you that we have read with the utmost interest the motion for a resolution on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and EMU. Amongst the measures suggested in this resolution is for the ECB to undertake a yearly quantitative analysis of the benefits of the single currency for citizens. I am not sure at this stage that such a yearly quantitative report would be the most appropriate means, for reasons of methodological and data constraints. But we will reflect on all appropriate means to enhance communication on the interest of the single currency for our fellow citizens of the euro area through the widest possible range of tools at our disposal – press conferences, publication of the annual reports and monthly bulletins, and speeches delivered and articles published all over the euro area. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, if I may, I should like to conclude by adding three remarks on Europe’s current situation, following the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the development of Europe has a rhythm of its own, which can only be evaluated with the passage of time. The European Central Bank and its President have confidence in Europe’s ability to overcome the current difficulties, and I fully shared the feeling of confidence and determination immediately expressed in the statement signed by your President, Josep Borrell Fontelles, and Jean-Claude Juncker and José Manuel Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the challenges and the opportunities offered to Europe at the present time by European and world history, demography, technology and the economy are so significant that they make it even more urgent to implement the necessary programme of reforms devised in Lisbon and relaunched in Brussels during the March European Council. On this issue, as on many others, I fully agree with the rapporteur’s conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, everyone can be sure that in the future, as in the past, we will fully adhere to our mandate: the draft Constitution does not comprise any changes to the operation of the European Central Bank and of the single currency, which are based on the extremely solid foundations bestowed upon them by the Treaty of Maastricht. Europe can rely on the European Central Bank and the euro system to remain, in all circumstances, anchors of stability and credibility, and on the ECB, within the limits of its responsibilities, to preserve confidence.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Lauk and Mr Maaten, on the excellent work they have done on their respective reports. I believe that this Parliament’s decision to discuss them jointly this afternoon is a wise one, because it is clear that the present and the future of the euro are very closely linked to the activities and correct decisions of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the euro and the Central Bank have been under attack over recent weeks. The criticisms made within the public debate have been logical and positive. If these attacks are based on a lack of arguments or on demagoguery, we must respond to them. I believe that this debate offers a good opportunity to respond to some of the unfounded criticisms levelled at the single currency and the European Central Bank over recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin, like Mr Maaten’s report, by insisting on the advantages of the euro, on the positive aspects of the single currency since it was launched: it has given us stability in the face of possible monetary turbulence and crises, such as those we have experienced in the past; it has given us price stability, largely thanks to the correct monetary policies of the European Central Bank; thanks to that stability, it has provided us with low interest rates and protects us from risks which we must not assume are behind us. The euro allows us to deal with the risks that we were subject to before, but we must not forget that those risks may appear again unless we maintain confidence in, and the credibility of, our currency and our Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that, during the two referenda held in France and in the Netherlands, some of the criticisms of the ‘no’ camp treated Brussels as a kind of ‘scapegoat’. They intended to criticise elements of the world situation or the strategies of the respective national governments, but when making those criticisms, they pointed the finger at Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that the same thing is happening with the euro and with monetary policy. The low growth of the European economies is not a problem caused by the single currency or by monetary policy; it is essentially a problem of the lack of structural reforms, the loss of dynamism, flexibility and the capacity of the European economies to adapt in a globalised world in which, for some time now, economic borders have not had the same meaning that they had a century ago.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to propose correct economic policies to our citizens involving strategies for progress, growth, well-being and employment, therefore, we cannot indulge in nostalgia for the past or focus on the wrong adversary. The past is not going to return and the adversary is not the euro or monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At these difficult times for the European Union, therefore, from both economic and political points of view, we must take particular responsibility for taking the correct decisions. I believe, as I have said inside and outside of this Parliament on many occasions, that the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, which has very significant support from this Parliament, is a correct decision that is starting to be applied rigorously, as President Trichet has just called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week we will debate the proposed recommendations adopted a few days ago by the Commission in the Ecofin Council with regard to Italy; in the coming weeks we will do so in relation to Portugal and before the end of the year we will do so with regard to other countries: some of the founding countries of the European Union and also some of the new member countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Those rules must be applied with credibility and energy, but also rationally, in order not to provide support for the arguments of those people who want to set economic stability and budgetary discipline against economic growth and job creation on the grounds that they are incompatible; they are perfectly compatible. Following its reform, the current Stability and Growth Pact allows that compatibility to have practical consequences in terms of the decisions adopted by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Trichet has just said and as the report says, we must strengthen the dialogue of the European Central Bank, whose independence must be respected, with the Commission and the Council and, in particular, with the Eurogroup. I have the privilege of observing the important dialogue held each month within the Eurogroup between the President of the European Central Bank and the Finance Ministers of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">We must deal with a very important issue with which I would like to end this speech <span class="bold"></span> the enlargement of the euro zone to the new Member States, which will be in a position over the next few years to join the 12 current member countries <span class="bold"></span> rigorously and at the same time taking a broad view.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming months we will have to analyse rigorously, frankly and with full dialogue with the countries in question, whether Estonia, Lithuania or Slovenia — which were the first three enlargement countries to join the exchange rate mechanism in 2004 — next year comply with each and every condition laid down in the Treaty in order to join the euro zone, as their authorities wish.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, with regard to information on the euro, I would like to inform this Parliament that, over recent months, I have begun a programme of visits, that will continue over the months between now and the end of the year, to all the new Member States to discuss in detail with their authorities, both with their governments and with the Presidents of their respective Central Banks, their degree of preparedness for joining the euro zone when the time comes. We have learnt a lot since the nineties: we can and we must communicate this experience to the authorities of the countries which will eventually join the euro zone and we can use these successive enlargements of the euro zone to explain to all of the European citizens, of the new and of the old member countries, the great advantages of the euro, and dispel some of the false ideas expressed about our single currency.</p>

<p class="contents">I also agree wholeheartedly with many of the previous speakers regarding the introduction of the euro in the old Member States. This was carried out at a time of reduced economic growth in the Eurozone, with insufficient structural reforms and with poor implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. This has indirectly had a strong impact on the negative perception of the euro by our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Maaten that despite the fact that the process of introducing the euro in the twelve Member States has been one of the most successful projects in the history of the European Union, the inhabitants of individual countries have a very different perception of this fact, and we have to acknowledge that with this process we have not succeeded in winning over the citizens, who regard the introduction of the euro as the reason for increases in consumer prices. This has evidently had a generally negative effect on public opinion of the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we prevent this from happening with the new Member States, which are making efforts to introduce the euro soon? Even now the predominant opinion in the new Member States is of the negative effect the euro will have on consumer prices. We will have to rely decisively on a more convincing, and in particular permanent publicity campaign tailored to the needs of each individual country and region.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States should also make use of any experience, mainly positive, of the old Member States, particularly within the framework of twinning programmes. Although it is by no means a requirement, the Member States should find partners with whom to exchange their experience in spreading the good news about the introduction of the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Manuel António dos Santos, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> I shall naturally focus exclusively on the report by Mr Lauk, although I do believe that both can be discussed together.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin by commending you, Mr Trichet, on the outstanding quality of your report and on the way in which the information has been set out before us, in keeping with the rapporteur’s speech. Yet I also wish to say to the whole House that that is frankly not the point of this debate. What Parliament is set to adopt or reject is Mr Lauk’s report, and we must therefore give our opinions solely on Mr Lauk’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear to all of us that the main objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), as laid down in the Treaties in force, is to maintain price stability. We all know, however, that even within the scope of the current Treaties, the monetary authority is also responsible for fostering economic growth, for properly sustaining job creation and for boosting internal demand. The rapporteur has focused almost exclusively on the bank’s main objective of maintaining price stability, thereby overstating its importance; he has also sought to drum home, needlessly and <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span>, the institution’s position as regards the recent changes to the Stability and Growth Pact. In so doing, he has, in my view, put himself in a delicate and isolated position, one that we obviously cannot support. During the debate in committee, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sought to remedy this shortcoming, but unfortunately the blocs that formed during the voting process prevented our points from being adopted. We therefore hope, in contrast with the rapporteur’s call, that these mistakes can be corrected in plenary. After all, there is no point in stressing positions and opinions that may be justifiable on the basis of one-dimensional economic thinking, but which say nothing to the citizens and which fly in the face of the day-to-day reality faced by businesses. The current EU crisis is not solely, nor even predominantly, an institutional crisis. Without any shadow of a doubt, this is a crisis of policies that have proved incapable of solving people’s actual problems, incapable of sustainably promoting economic growth and incapable of creating high-quality jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The constant refrain that economic and social success can only be achieved by carrying out structural reforms is looking increasingly like empty rhetoric. This is firstly because structural reforms cost money and are payable per head, which means that expenses are incurred before any benefits are felt; secondly, because the nature of national public finances is increasingly less predisposed towards public investment, particularly the least visible kind of public investment that has difficulty attracting party support in the short term; and thirdly, because the restrictive and blinkered implementation of budgetary consolidation policies blocks any kind of effort focused exclusively on this reforming area, which, given the crucial nature of this area, is clearly an inadequate state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">To criticise the minor amendments made to the Pact by the Council, as the rapporteur does – and this places him alongside the most hard-line critics of those amendments – is, in my view, to overlook the wider picture in Europe and the EU’s economic and social problems. It is obvious that the ECB’s activities must be seen in the context of the absence of a European government model, which is a positive thing and is not the issue at hand. Mr Lauk attaches great importance to this – and it is indeed something that we can also think about – but what I am referring to is the conservative position, with which I cannot possibly associate myself. I therefore ask this House, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to correct some of the mistakes contained in the report by Mr Lauk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite political upheavals, the euro is proving itself to be quite stable, is becoming more and more a major reserve currency, and, as we have heard, the EU’s new Member States are keen to introduce it at home without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB’s work has not exactly been made any easier by various economic developments in the eurozone and by political pressure, but it has nonetheless, from the very outset, maintained its independence and behaved in a professional manner. I would encourage the European Central Bank to maintain its commitment to independence and continue to regard the defence of the euro’s stability as its primary function. This, as you can see, is where there is a great gulf between the groups in this House, and Mr dos Santos and I are not of one mind.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason why the conditions under which the ECB operates are problematic is that the reform of the Stability Pact largely did away with the second pillar of the euro’s stability, leaving the ECB with principal responsibility for currency stability. This House has proposed various ways of improving the implementation of the reform in practice, all of which the Council has disregarded, thereby indicating that, although the finance ministers may well not see the relaxation of the Pact as desirable, they do at any rate acquiesce in it with a degree of approval. Why this should be so is explained not least by the fact that the big countries in the eurozone – Germany, France and Italy – have been breaching the terms of the Pact for years without being called to account for it. Germany will be unable to comply with the Pact’s requirements over the next two years, and certainly not this year. As we have just heard, Italy breached the Pact as early as 2003, and it, too, needs another two years to get back in the clear.</p>
<p class="contents">As I draw to my close, let me say that the ECB Board should avail itself of the option provided for by Article 10 of its statutes to take decisions by simple majority rather than seeking consensus at any price. Consensus often represents no more than the lowest common denominator, and the Bank should not be satisfied with it. I can well understand how, at a time of great political pressure such as the present, the ECB is unwilling to publish minutes, let alone records showing who voted for what, but I do hope that the day will come when the minutes can be published, along with indications of the way the votes went.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to endorse what Mr Lauk said about the need for you to follow the US Federal Reserve’s example and publish a <span class="italic">Beige Book</span> containing a detailed analysis of the ways in which individual countries’ economies develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What has come out of this Pact? Price stability is only one facet of it; it has also brought mass unemployment and an immense increase in poverty in Europe. Rather than growth, it has brought blatant social breakdown; in place of stability, record profits for big business. Mr Lauk, however, in this report, is unmoved by either the social upheavals or the self-evident problems involved in the implementation of the Pact, and continues to sing its praises. Even worse, and absurdly, the report posits a link between working times in Europe and economic crisis, as if the problem would be solved if those still with jobs to go to were to work longer and longer hours, driving themselves to the point of collapse, while more and more people do not even get the chance to make use of their skills!</p>
<p class="contents">Those who understand European politics in this way and present it in this light must not be surprised when more and more people turn their backs on them. What the abortive constitutional referenda in France and the Netherlands clearly showed is that most Europeans want something else – new politics, with a social orientation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If only the public realised what a success it is, euroscepticism would vanish and people would all come to love the euro. The problem, we are told, is lack of knowledge. Hence the drive to spend EUR 16 million on a communication and information campaign giving neutral and factual information.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the neutral and factual information is not likely to persuade EU citizens in the desired direction. All the large eurozone countries, and several of the smaller ones, are struggling with poor growth and rising government debt. The rules of the Stability Pact have been flouted all round and no honest observer can try to claim that the new flexible pact has any teeth, although the Commission has recently been pointing the finger at Italy. Yet we all agree that fiscal discipline is necessary if the euro is to endure as a multinational currency.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do we measure success? Easier travel, says Mr Maaten; lower interest rates, says Mr Trichet. But lower interest rates are more a response to poor growth than a sign of success. While the ECB must be applauded for its achievements with consistently low inflation, Mr Trichet’s deputy admits that the euro may have been part of the problem, accepting that the ‘one size fits all’ interest rate is not appropriate for countries with different inflation rates and business cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has not succeeded in its aim of binding EU citizens in ever-closer union. The euro has not succeeded in forcing countries to adopt the structural reforms that are necessary for the long-term health of eurozone economies. Is that the information that will be provided under this initiative? It should be, because that is what is relevant to people’s wellbeing. An objective appraisal would admit that in creating the euro the EU has tried to create a silk purse from a pig’s ear. It is now obvious that what we have is indeed the pig’s ear – perhaps not something we should be boasting about too loudly.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we learned nothing from France and the Netherlands, where the efforts of governments to obtain a ‘yes’ in their referendums on the Constitution merely hardened opinion against it? To spend money now promoting the euro would be foolish and irresponsible. It would also be typical of the head in the sand arrogance that we have come to expect from the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the challenges are on-going and they are worrying. The consumers are bearing the brunt of that particular worry.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Trichet, only a few weeks ago you called upon European consumers to open up their purses and spend more, but there is not enough certainty in the current economic climate to facilitate the surge in spending that you call for. I speak for many of my constituents when I tell you that people purchasing houses are worried about whether the interest rate is going down, about house prices going up, when and where, and what the long-term outlook is. They are uncertain as to what the current hike in oil prices will mean, how long the side-effects will last and what to expect in the long term – their future.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, business confidence in countries such as Germany was on the increase. However, while benefiting from a fall in the euro, they were turning the other cheek within days to be hit with record high oil prices. Companies and consumers are finding it difficult to gauge whether their prospects are good or bad. Such an environment does not cultivate consumer confidence, domestic demand or domestic growth. The predominant risk to growth is the high energy prices. For businesses and consumers dependent on oil, that is detrimental. Our dependency on oil is proving too costly in every respect. We need to look at the long-term energy issue from the perspective of economic viability and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Dependency on any single resource leads to market vulnerability. Real energy alternatives are needed to combat this. Let us take the reform of the sugar sector, for example. Countries such as Ireland are to be badly affected by the reform of the sugar sector. However, we need to take initiatives both nationally and at European level to counteract the inevitable negative impacts on these reforms. Irish and European industries need to be assisted in turning a declining sugar industry into a profitable alternative energy source, such as biofuel. There are many fledgling industries, such as the rape-seed oil industry, that need to be financially promoted and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures, Mr Trichet, will assist in creating economic stability, environmental sustainability and consumer confidence. All policies are interdependent and no economy should have a higher rate of dependency on any one energy source and no amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate can change that fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Particularly under the present political conditions, I think it would be mistaken to make too great haste in enlarging the eurozone. I think that the transparency of your own institution would be of great value particularly when difficult decisions have to be taken and it would be useful to know who had been on what side.

At a time when the Stability and Growth Pact has been under fire, you contended in splendid fashion for the stability of the euro, facing down the Member States, the Council and the Commission too. For that you have the warm thanks of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which wishes to encourage you to keep on doing the same thing, for things are not getting any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact was softened up, loosened up, or – according to some – abolished; that is something on which I do not propose to comment right now. We are, of course, currently seeing to what extent it is applied, and what effect it has, in Italy, and there are doubts in some people’s minds about that. What has happened over recent months has not, though, done away with the risk of inflation, which has, on the contrary, increased. To Mrs Wagenknecht, who seems, unfortunately, to have a more pressing appointment to go to, and who spoke of ‘new poverty’, I would say that real poverty is present when money loses its value. As you, Mr Trichet, said, we should, in future, take constant care to require the reforms at national level, which are so necessary. I would have liked the Commission to respond appropriately when your own country’s Mr de Villepin proposed the eventual establishment, alongside the ECB, of an economic and financial government, which would be responsible for both economic growth and job creation. This is the logical second step. The first was to fundamentally change the Stability and Growth Pact or do away with it altogether, and the second step, now, is to give the European Central Bank equal responsibility for both price stability and other measures, not least for economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than warn of the need for the nation states to do their homework, for the most irresponsible thing we can do at present – and it is something I hear from members of the other political group – is to suggest to people that there is no need for change, that no more than a different policy on the part of the ECB is needed, and that social standards can remain as they are. That is irresponsible, particularly as those who indulge in this sort of talk, are those who ought most to be aware of the fact that reforms at national level are more urgently needed than ever.</p>

The recession, slow growth rates, restrictions on social policies, rising unemployment, inflexible financial perspectives and higher inflation have led European citizens into an impasse or to some degree of difficulty. This has resulted in their voting for a different Europe, because they had been given the impression that bad Europe and the bad euro are to blame for everything. That is why this Commission communication and, more importantly, Mr Maaten's balanced report, have an important role and can send a message to the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizens must be informed in depth about the contribution of the euro to their everyday lives and about the functioning of the European Union as regards financial prosperity, social solidarity and the organised and decisive implementation of the Lisbon Strategy policies. The analyses by the Central Bank and by the Commission may help in this direction. This revised communications policy about the euro should be clear to the new countries from the point of view of their integration into the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the information and communication strategy, it would be better to emphasise the following points:</p>
<p class="contents">focusing efforts to make the single currency more popular on special groups of citizens, on consumers, on towns and on small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they have the facility to adapt better.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to say that, in all events, the message which needs to be given is that the euro and EMU in general are perhaps one of the most successful achievements of the European Union and should be seen as such by all European citizens. Every difficulty and every new vision of the future of Europe must be based on its conquests, which must not be bartered away. In order to achieve this, we need properly informed and enlightened citizens and reliable Community policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although at first glance they perhaps appear somewhat different, they are united by one thing: now the European Central Bank's monetary policy and the euro are both the subject of intense criticism. It is clear that while the economic evaluation of these factors, that is, monetary policy and the euro, may vary, we must surely recognise that the communication strategy as regards the common monetary policy and the euro is really not a success. We ought to conclude that this communication strategy should be reviewed, and that this is particularly relevant now, during the on-going discussions on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the experience of Lithuania, I can say that when you introduce any economic reform, it has a different effect on various groups of residents. Thus when we talk about Europe's monetary policy and the euro, we must appreciate that the effect of this or that decision will vary greatly depending on the group of residents; I welcome the European Central Bank's intention to analyse the influence on resident groups. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we ought to mention not only the positive aspects, but also the problems that appear in the short term when introducing one economic reform or another, as there is no such thing as an economic decision that acts as a miracle drug with immediate positive results. This means that while informing residents, it is also necessary to report problems, let us say when prices increase in the new Member States, as without doubt we are witnessing price convergence between the old and new countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the information campaign and communication strategy must be of a permanent nature. Short-term campaigns are not effective. Every day we will be exposed to the influence of the European Central Bank's decisions, and every day we will use the euro and all those problems will be with us constantly, meaning that the process of explanation must be constant and active.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The incentive behind this policy is to strengthen the competitiveness of the monopolies of big business by reducing the cost of the workforce. The European Central Bank is the institution of the European Union which has full and exclusive responsibility for monetary policy and zealously defends its social indifference, maintaining that its sole objective is price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The price stability and low inflation in the eurozone cited by the rapporteur have done nothing to protect the workers, for whom they do not even apply, from high prices and poverty, which are increasing still further following the leap in the price of oil and the fall in wages. In the name of competitiveness and in order to respond to the demands of big business, a new anti-grass roots assault is under way in the Member States. A new package of anti-grass roots measures is being promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, paragraph 11 of the report welcoming the commitment by the European Central Bank to the ratification of the so-called European Constitution is an insult, given that it was recently voted down by the peoples of France and the Netherlands. This sort of thing shows disdain at the very least for the peoples of Europe.</p>

The European Union has become stronger, more stable, and internally more open. However, we must get used to the fact that for various reasons our citizens do not always react positively to new things, particularly if they do not bring clear positive benefits in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that good things grow of their own accord. In my opinion, this will also be true of the euro in the historical perspective. The older and middle generations may indeed yearn wistfully for the old currencies, but the younger generation will regard the euro as their currency. In the same way the younger generation will no longer be affected by the various prejudices resulting from the decades of a divided Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A stable and reliable euro will undoubtedly be both a condition for, as well as a reflection of, the fact that both the European Central Bank as well as individual Member States are conducting a responsible policy. However, an objective judgment is necessary. The European Parliament should not waffle on and delay amendments that have been duly passed on the first reading, which was what happened at the June plenary session, when discussing mechanisms for more effective control over the budget deficits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a clear mandate, and you and your team do what is expected of you. For that we are grateful. You are predictable, consistent, reliable, and foster trust and confidence. Your policy is characterised by calmness and a steady hand, and all I ask of you is that you keep it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, of course, I also bid you step in when public statements, statistics or actions go against your convictions and the facts. As a global player, you need to do more to explain to the public the events that occur on the global stage, the ways in which we are dependent on them and their consequences for us, and I urge you to help policy-makers convey the objective necessity of structural reforms and the balancing of budgets, and the fact that sustainable growth and rising numbers of people in work are dependent on them.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also urge you, though, to deter countries from running up deficits – if need be, by means of higher interest rates and poorer internal ratings.

From that point of view, people are, however, today led to wonder about what economists call the balance of the policy mix. There must be a defect in this famous policy mix since growth has not materialised. With regard to the policy of the Central Bank, we have for a very long time been particularly attached to the need to establish the authority and legitimacy of the ECB and confidence in the decisions it takes. I would say that, in a way, this was an institutional quest. It appears to me that we must now reach the age of maturity and refrain from simply passing the blame on to the governments that delay in implementing the structural reforms, failing which we will not move the debate on. Progress is necessary, however, in order to rediscover growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">From that standpoint, I should like to make three observations. Firstly, Mr Trichet, I am told that the quality of your listening skills and of your contribution to the work of the Economics and Finance Ministers of the eurozone is extremely high and that the latter are pleased to have you by their side when they debate the situation in the zone. I believe, however, that dialogue comprises an idea of reciprocity and that if you intervene on the reform of the Pact and on the required structural reforms, others must, in return, be able to tell you how things stand with regard to monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the method of decision-making, I agree with the observations of my colleague, Wolf Klinz. In all likelihood, the method of decision-making laid down in the treaties is the right one. From the beginning, however, this Parliament has, as you know, requested transparency, or in any event information, concerning the nature of the debates taking place within the Council of Governors, and I believe that that request is a legitimate one. In the absence of the necessary information, in actual fact, one gains the impression that it is perhaps the absence of consensus among the members of the Council of Governors that prevents decision-making and that stops matters from developing.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, I will make a third observation in the space of a few short words. It is about evaluating the economic policy and the economic situation. The Central Bank is too obsessed with structural reform, without recognising that there will be no structural reform without growth. From this standpoint, the objectives in terms of inflation, as they were evaluated at the start of the period, ought perhaps to be reviewed. Perhaps you ought to begin consultations so that, in future, people have access to an assessment of inflation that is more in line with the needs of an economy that has to assume transition costs. These must not become the responsibility of future generations but, rather, be to their advantage, since, on the basis of a boost in growth, future generations will be able to fund the repayment of this inflation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe’s prospects for economic success are bound to structural reforms; many of our colleagues have mentioned this. In an economic climate characterised by unsatisfactory budget deficits and widespread unemployment, several points deserve special emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we cannot avoid referring to the Stability and Growth Pact once again. The new framework for the future of the SGP has now been adopted; it has some good as well as some bad new rules. I would like to encourage the ECB to do its utmost to ensure that all reforms to the pact are interpreted correctly and increase transparency and efficacy along with expediting the structural consolidation process. It is important to remember that any weakening of the corrective arm of the SGP would render what was once a powerful mechanism for growth a casualty of flawed political judgement.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we can harness the energy of European competition by adopting and implementing the Services Directive as soon as possible. Likewise, vast benefits for citizens should compel us to push for full regulation of cross-border retail payments, and to work towards a Single European Payments Area by 2010. This is what citizens expect from us.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the reforms undertaken by national central banks to adapt their structures to the new institutional framework are paramount to reversing our current downward trend. I am proud to say the Bank of Finland – my own central bank – is one of the central banks which has made impressive moves towards reaching this objective. It has really tried to reform its structures in order to achieve an improved balance in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I congratulate the ECB on its sound decision to support ratification of the Constitution. The choice to integrate under a constitution can only lead to a stronger political union. This is what our voters in France and the Netherlands want, even though they rejected the Constitution; they still want more political union and the Constitution is one way to achieve this on the economic front. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The past and present products of our minds must be better communicated and discussed, and that goes for the euro too. Before it was introduced, there was a need for people to be persuaded; now that it is there, people have come to a positive view of it, and that needs to be reinforced and confirmed if it is to be sustainable and people are to identify with it, and that is what we want communications management to do. It also has to be said that, both before and after the event, prices in both currencies were, and are, among the most important measures to help with the introduction of the euro. Consumers’ organisations and the economic and social partners have a crucial part to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, though, confidence in money and the currency will not be fostered merely by rattling off the reasons why price stability must take priority. It is when people find work and enjoy social protection that confidence is built up.</p>

Despite the apparent inflation, many members of the public see the euro as a success story, and, while I am on that subject, I would like to say how much I agree with Mr Ettl that it is certainly not price stability alone that brings Europe economic growth, but rather – as Mr Trichet pointed out – economic policy that responds to the present need for reform, and that is what we need to see at the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point that the rapporteur addressed and which continues to be seen as a major problem by many members of the public, by which I mean the high costs involved in transferring funds across borders. I hope – indeed, I am sure – that the Commission will continue its efforts to implement a single payment area in Europe once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Radwan, I do not believe that we need a single economic government in Europe to witness the European Central Bank – whose independence is, as it must be, guaranteed – rendering an account of its policy to the ministers of the economy and of finance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that the European Central Bank, by commenting on the relaxing of the Stability and Growth Pact, assumed a political role, which it is of course entitled to do. The younger generation in particular find it absolutely unacceptable that the Member States should, year in and year out, spend several hundred billions of euros more than they collect in tax, and that it should be a matter of European policy – through the alteration of the Stability Pact – that this practice should in some sense be defended. It follows that I am very grateful indeed to you, Mr Trichet, for not mincing your words when speaking about such changes to the Pact, and, with the interests of the younger generation in mind, I ask you to continue, in future, to keep a close eye on everything done in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact, constantly bearing in mind the needs of monetary policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To begin with, the consensus emerging within this Parliament on the subject of the monetary orthodoxy of the ECB can legitimately fill you with glee. Then, by observing the extent to which Mr Lauk’s report falls into line with your recommendations and stresses the de facto political power of the ECB, you must be overjoyed! You have nothing to fear from the representatives of this Parliament as they are zealous defenders of the solutions that you recommend and that have, however, with tragic consistency, failed to restore growth and confidence in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So rejoice! Mr Lauk’s report puts forward better proposals than the social security system reforms that you commend, better proposals than the pay restraint that you suggest, better proposals than the reduction in public spending that you oversee. It calls for an increase in working time in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my first term of office in this Parliament. As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have intervened on several occasions in this Chamber to express my concern, among the empty benches, about the poor economic and social results of the economic guidelines decided on by the Commission and by your institution. I note in passing that those on whom this report is going to impose the burden of additional working time have been more effective than you in fighting against the overvaluation of the euro by voting no, in France and in the Netherlands, to the policy that you support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a fervent supporter of Europe. As such, I am in favour of monetary stability and I defend with conviction a greater convergence of the European economies, but I call on you to acknowledge that there is not just one possible economic and monetary policy and to remember that the effectiveness of your term of office is first and foremost assessed in the everyday lives of Europeans and in what they have to say about their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall confine my remarks to the Maaten report.</p>
<p class="contents">That the euro may suffer from a popularity deficit in some countries in the eurozone should come as no surprise. There are two main reasons for this, neither of which has anything to do with the lack of a communication strategy. First, the perception that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increasing inflation in Member States has done serious damage to its image, even though, according to official figures, only 0.2% of the increase is attributable to the euro. However, this macroeconomic average disguises large price increases in a long list of everyday items such as coffee, vegetables, bread, hairdressing and parking meters, largely due to opportunistic marking up or rounding-off during the changeover period.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, our citizens’ attitudes to the euro reflects the economic situations in their own countries and their insecurity about their futures, pensions, jobs for their children and many other issues. Whilst the euro can help promote economic growth, it cannot do that on its own without sensible fiscal policies and sound economic management in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to focus on economic reform, especially in countries with unacceptably high unemployment and abysmal growth rates, in order to deliver on the Lisbon promises and not just come out with the same old Lisbon rhetoric. The new President-in-Office, Tony Blair, in his speech to the European Parliament – and what a marvellous production that was; obviously the diplomats had got at him, or it, since the summit – rightly focused on this as a priority and on the illiberal so-called European social model, which protects the privileged and does nothing to create jobs and investment or increase economic growth. Any PR or information campaigns will be an uphill struggle, a waste of money and time, unless they are in the context of sound economic management. The euro will just continue to be the scapegoat for Member States’ own failures.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact on which EMU was founded, I trust that, under the revised and hopefully robust pact, the lack of even-handedness in chastising errant Member States will be a thing of the past. The credibility of our single currency and its public image and acceptance depend on all Member States adhering fully to it and the rules being applied evenly under the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that the euro has been fully accepted in my own country, Ireland. It is true that we had a very successful changeover programme but, more importantly, we have 4% unemployment, less than half the EU average, and our economic growth is approaching 6%, three times the EU average. We are very willing to help new Member States with their changeover preparations. We already have twinning arrangements in place with Cyprus and Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the EMU and the euro are a most successful pan-European project for trade, travel and price transparency, and overnight the euro has become an international reserve currency. The euro can be the icing on the cake of sound economic management, but no amount of propaganda or spin can ever sell it on its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During 2004, the year of enlargement to 25, interest rates have been maintained and prices have not changed when compared to the end of the previous year. There has therefore been a situation of stability, but also one of a lack of dynamism. The economic results of the eurozone have not met with prior expectations: there has been little increase in economic activity within the context of the greatest world growth of the last 20 years, market share has been lost in international trade and the productivity differential with the United States has increased, while there has been no significant change in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just necessary to reflect, therefore, but also to make a great commitment: sustainable growth and employment are the main concerns of the Europeans. The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is a good response, since it replaces a mechanical approach with rationality.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time, Mr President, we wish to stress the European Central Bank’s special ability to provide financial conditions for everybody. We particularly welcome the reference in its report to the situation of small and medium-sized businesses and we would point out that, at this critical time when it is necessary to increase confidence in the common project, you will continue to enjoy our support in carrying out your duties</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, I am very much opposed to the idea of an EU-backed pro-euro propaganda campaign. This idea stems from the mistaken belief that societies are incapable of understanding the facts by themselves, and that they need the enlightened elite to help them do so. This belief has recently been discredited in the debate on the draft Constitutional Treaty, and I am quite sure that it will be discredited once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a region that is home to the largest German minority in Poland. These people travel to work in Germany every day, and they noticed the difference the euro made to their own financial circumstances. They do not live in a social vacuum, but communicate with their neighbours. What kind of theoretical arguments can we put forward that will override their personal experience? How much money will we have to spend to convince them that prices would not rise if the euro was introduced, given that they have already experienced such rises once before?</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on the EU to admit that it has taken a wrong turning, and to abandon its attempts to use expensive promotional strategies, whether well or poorly formulated, to change the facts. Such strategies will not change people’s minds. What would change their minds, however, is a strong and stable European currency that needed no accolades. We should create the economic conditions that would allow the euro to become just such a currency in reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, as new Member States, have the advantage of being able to learn from these mistakes. First of all we have to see the effect on the cost of living; statistics do indeed show that the average cost of living only increased minimally with the introduction of the euro, but, as colleagues of mine have remarked, when one delves deeper into the subject one realises that there were substantial increases in the prices of objects and services which European citizens use everyday. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, rather than focusing on superficial issues, a campaign on the euro should concentrate on consumer protection and on preventing abusive increases in prices, for we cannot allow the change in currency to become another occasion for a few irresponsible businessmen to take the opportunity to increase prices more than they should. Thirdly, where the adoption of the euro is concerned, there is a need for broad consultation between social partners. In Malta, for example, the decision that we should join the ERM2 now, was taken unilaterally by the government without any kind of consultation, not even about the base rate. This is the ideal recipe for further increasing resistance in the future. This is not how things should be done. I believe that the euro project is very important for the European Union and for the new Member States, but this should be done without unnecessary haste, for as they say, haste trips up its own heels, and from this haste it is only the poorer classes who suffer.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What makes it even more relevant is the fact that, on the basis of their undertakings in the accession treaty, ten new countries are preparing to adopt the euro as their legal tender when they have fulfilled the five main Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the benefits of the single currency and the accompanying mechanisms cannot be challenged, a certain segment of the European population take a negative view of the euro, associating it also with price increases. They are wagering on the sentiments of the inhabitants of 12 EU Members, which ultimately failed to come true. They also reflect the concerns of the inhabitants of three of the old Member States who did not adopt the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if I do meet some colleagues who are of the opinion that information campaigns are money thrown to the wind, the recent experience of the two unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands make me believe that the architecture of the most important project of the EU, the European Constitution, foundered because of the lack of information. And a coherent, ambitious and long-term communications strategy about the euro can help us to get back in touch with the citizens and convince them of the benefits of the EU that they enjoy in their daily lives. The campaign needs to be clear and comprehensible, but above all straightforward and aimed primarily at more remote regions with limited opportunities for spreading information among the public. It should be aimed at people in employment and, in particular, at groups at risk, such as pensioners, the unemployed, people with disabilities and minorities. It should be used to explain to consumers the underlying principles, to prevent them from associating changes in price levels directly with the introduction of the euro – for instance, the introduction of dual pricing, and proper rounding up.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spirit of the project of monetary stability in the EU, which is its most successful project to date, we should express our agreement with this report, so that the right procedures and know-how obtained in the previous introduction of the euro, explained in a successful campaign, also bring benefits in the introduction of the euro in the new Member States, as well as in the future enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II are Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia and Denmark. The first three countries have a good chance of introducing the euro and taking advantage of its positive merits in 2007. </p>
<p class="contents">Lithuania and Estonia are the only European Union Member States whose currency has already been pegged to the euro for several years. For this reason, joining the single currency should go smoothly. Nevertheless, the rumours circulating that the introduction of the euro in the twelve states was followed by a large jump in prices may do some harm. Panic may be aroused unnecessarily by artificial demand for certain goods and traders' aims to greatly round off prices for their own benefit; thus, as described in the resolution, a timely and accurate information campaign is particularly important, as well as a study of both the positive and negative experiences of those states that have introduced the euro. </p>
<p class="contents">The Twin model may help greatly, but with 18 months remaining until the introduction of the euro, as far as we know the three countries mentioned do not yet have partners in this Twin Programme. These states should be urged to find partners as quickly as possible and work even more energetically.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the conditions under which the euro was introduced, it is true that there was abuse, in some countries more than others, in terms of taking advantage of the change of currency to round up and increase certain prices. It is also the case that the countries that were more and better prepared were able to prevent practically all the kinds of abuse that took place in countries that did not sufficiently prepare their lead-up to the single currency through information campaigns, but also through negotiations with the sectors affected, through transparency by means of displaying both prices for a reasonable period of time prior to the actual introduction of coins and notes, and also through information during the days immediately following the entry into force of coins and notes.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that both the European Central Bank and the Commission have studied the general impact of the abuse on price indices, which did not exceed 0.2% - 0.3%, but the negative perception of many citizens remains. I agree with Mr Doyle’s view that now, several years after the introduction of coins and notes, the citizens who express scepticism about the euro do so much more because of the situation of the economy, the increase in unemployment, the inability to promote investments or generate employment, than because of their memory of abuses that took place a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of abuse must not be exaggerated. Today in the Danish press, the Danish Finance Minister, Mr Pedersen, says that in Denmark, a country that is not in the euro zone, the rises in the prices of certain services — bars, restaurants and certain services provided directly to citizens — during January and February 2002 were practically identical to the increases that took place in the countries that introduced the euro. So we must not exaggerate, but we must learn from experience, particularly in the case of the new Member States that aspire to integrate their currencies into the euro over the coming years, and that is what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the citizens’ opinion of the economic situation, their confidence in it and in political and economic leaders goes much further than simply whether or not there has been abuse in the rounding up of certain prices. We have to talk about this, as we have done in this debate and as we will continue to do in others, about the implementation of the necessary structural reforms that we have discussed and that we are discussing within the context of the revised Lisbon Strategy, we must continue to talk about how to apply the Stability and Growth Pact <span class="bold"></span> and I referred earlier in my first speech to the Commission's commitment to apply the new Pact rigorously <span class="bold"></span> and I would like to ask some of you, who have called into question the possibility of applying budgetary discipline rules in the future within the framework of the economic and monetary union now that the Pact has been reformed, to take account of the reality of its application. We have been discussing how the Pact should be reformed. That debate is now over. The two new regulations have entered into force and we are now applying the new Pact. And I would ask the honourable Members to give their opinion on how the rules are applied rather than how you would have liked the rules to be, because the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact also depends <span class="bold"></span> very much <span class="bold"></span> on your opinion, and when some of your citizens or some politicians in the Member States hear some of you express the opinion that there are no longer any budgetary rules, they believe it, and I do not want certain Finance Ministers to believe that there are no budgetary rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Jean-Claude Trichet,</span> President of the European Central Bank. <span class="bold"></span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span>Yes, yes, I am also going to speak in French. I speak both languages. I even try to speak German, if you have noticed, and I would like to speak even more languages. </p>
<p class="contents">I was impressed by the fact that price stability is very much in the minds of all here and of all our fellow citizens. It seems very important to me to look at this issue, which is to some extent considered occasionally to be an obsession of the ECB. It is an obsession of the ECB because it is the mandate of the ECB. It also clearly reflects the message that we are getting from the people of Europe. They are telling us to maintain price stability, to preserve it. I believe that it would be an enormous mistake to change the definition of price stability. That is not what the people of Europe are calling for. It is certainly not to say that close to 2% is no good, but rather that it should be close to 3%. That would be absolutely abhorrent in the eyes of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Price stability is not only what we are called upon to effect by the Treaty and by the messages we receive in Parliament and through out fellow citizens, but it is also absolutely necessary for confidence in Europe: for consumer confidence and confidence in general. Confidence is a major ingredient for growth and job creation. It would be an enormous mistake to think that we can oppose price stability on the one hand, and growth and job creation on the other. On the contrary: by being credible with regard to price stability, we gain confidence in Europe and we also secure the very low market interest rate that has been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we have the lowest rates for the past hundred years. I am not only speaking about the short-term rates, but also the ten-year rates. The ten-year rates are made by the market itself, by the free encounter of supply and demand of savings. If we have the lowest rate for a hundred years, it is because price stability is credible, because we – the issuer of that currency – are credible. It is good for jobs and growth. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>I will mention two things. A good monetary policy can do many things. It can create conditions for growth and job creation, but it cannot do everything. We have evidence of that within the very heart of the eurozone, with the comparisons between one country and another – and a number of Members have spoken very eloquently about their own countries. There are in fact other factors that count. Sound budgetary policy is without doubt one of them, as are reforms. I will not dwell on these things, but they are absolutely crucial. It is a sentiment that we share entirely with the Commission, and I am keen to say so here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention a point, Mr President, that I believe is extremely important: the question has been raised of our independence and of our links with the executive bodies, with Parliament, with the Commission. Every fortnight, we invite Mr Almunia to the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank and, every fortnight, we invite the president of the Euro group. As Mr Almunia said, I myself am invited every month by the Euro group. That makes three invitations in total per month. With regard to our own invitation, moreover, it is in accordance with the treaty. The treaty itself stipulates it: we meet every fortnight and, every fortnight, we invite the president of the Euro group. Three times per month, therefore, in applying the treaty, the opportunity is there for a dialogue to take place with a strict adherence to independence. The European Central Bank is totally independent and that is a necessity. We would not have our current interest rates in 10 years, 30 years and 50 years from now, if it were not known that we are independent and, indeed, if there were the slightest suspicion about our independence. I would say again, however, that personal contact takes place on a permanent basis. I have more contact with the competent committee of the European Parliament, through Mrs Bérès, and with the Plenary Assembly of the European Parliament than my colleague Alan Greenspan has in the United States with the US Congress. That is not necessarily recognised, but contact takes place on an extremely frequent basis and, in the same way, contact with the executive bodies is incredibly frequent since it can take place three times per month.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of transparency, I should like to point out how attached we are to it; we consider it to be absolutely essential. We invented a new concept of transparency. Ever since the European Central Bank was created, it was decided that we would establish our diagnosis immediately after the decision of the Council of Governors and that there would be a press conference enabling us not only to make a diagnosis but also to answer questions. That did not exist before the European Central Bank was created. It was not at all ‘the state of the art’ among central banks and we, moreover, influenced the other central banks, which themselves began to explain what they were doing. Beforehand, they simply explained five or six weeks later, when they published the minutes of their deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would take the liberty of emphasising that what we do goes beyond this, since we immediately produce a four or five-page diagnosis, which is the diagnosis on which we ourselves agreed in the Council of Governors. In addition, we have the press conference.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, for now, my colleagues and I believe that it is far more important to champion the collegiate position of the Council of Governors than to declare individual positions. We are in an exceptional environment, the European environment, and we have the single currency for 12 sovereign countries. We believe that our duty is to champion this college, which is the relevant body.<span class="bold"> </span>Believe me, however, we are not in the least disturbed by the idea of consensus. We debate issues among ourselves. There is no question of postponing the slightest decision, and I can supply evidence of that. Following the tragic events of 11 September in New York, we were thus able to take very important decisions in the space of a few hours. I can therefore fully reassure you on that issue. We therefore genuinely believe that our concept of transparency, which was innovatory and which went further than what was the ‘state of the art’ for central bankers, is the right concept for the European Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
