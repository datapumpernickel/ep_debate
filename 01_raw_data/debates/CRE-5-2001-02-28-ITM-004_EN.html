Over the course of this year, the Commission has already discharged two key aspects of the White Paper, the reform of financial management and the new planning and programming cycle for the Commission's work. Within the allotted time frame, the Commission completed the third and most substantial and complex stage of the work announced by the White Paper this morning, with the adoption of guidelines on personnel<span class="bold"> </span>policy and management, which is, as you are aware, one of the most sensitive points of our administrative reform.</p>
<p class="contents">This very afternoon sees the beginning – the first meeting with the trade unions and the staff will take place today at 4 o'clock – of a further stage of consultation and conciliation, which is just as important and just as exacting<span class="bold">, </span>involving all the staff and all the representatives. Only when this process, which will take several months, is completed will the Commission define its position. Within the space of a few months, we will have to achieve the fundamental goal we have set ourselves of being a good employer in the years to come, offering competitive conditions to attract the most highly-skilled people for the European institutions and allowing its staff to reach the highest levels of efficiency, professionalism and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of work has been necessary for us to reach this point, and so, before I say anything else, I would like to thank Neil Kinnock and his staff for the huge amount of work they have put into the laborious preparation of these documents. Allow me once again to pay tribute to the staff of the Commission and all the institutions for their hard work this year. It has been a difficult year and I am aware that some sections of our staff are concerned at these rapid, far-reaching changes, which have come on top of an already heavy daily work schedule. However, a thorough review of the Commission's organisational model could not be put off: we had committed ourselves to the task before Parliament and the work was most urgent and absolutely essential. There had not been a complete reorganisation for decades. Therefore, we intend to make every endeavour to secure a broad, intense debate on the guidelines and details of the reform, so that it becomes the common legacy of all and all commit themselves to furthering its progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, nevertheless, like to take this opportunity to stress a fundamental concept: the reform is not and never has been a political end in itself, to be taken out of its wide institutional and political context, that is. It is part of a clearly-defined project which has furthered peace and democracy in Europe, creating a model of cooperation and development based on the principle of the rule of law and on respect for fundamental values. The institutions of this unique model, the institutions of the European Union, have played a fundamental role in this process and it is amazing to see – and this is one of the things which has made the greatest impression on me since I have been here in Brussels – the extent to which the people who work in the institutions view their jobs as completely different from any other job; there is an unmistakable atmosphere of being part of the historic project of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This widespread motivation is evidence of the unique nature of the administrations of the Community institutions and a guarantee of their strength, and it is on this new basis that we are building the new European civil service, which will be different from the civil services of the national States but will complement them. It is awareness of this uniqueness which underlies the guidelines we have adopted today: to reform outdated rules and customs in order to make it possible for the institutions to deal with the challenges of future years, keeping the European project clearly in their sights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three points on which the guidelines for the reform of personnel policy and management are based: firstly, we intend to guarantee the pay and pension levels necessary for an independent, high-level European civil service; secondly, we want to improve working conditions to enable our staff to work to the best of their abilities, progressing professionally and having their rights recognised, with the aim of ensuring the right balance between job satisfaction and private commitments; thirdly and lastly, we want to introduce a more modern career structure to allow our staff to adapt to new tasks, removing the rigidities which have become established over the years and increasing responsibility and rewarding merit at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">A large-scale programme of investment in training activities will be an essential complement to the achievement of these objectives. I have to say, in this regard, that training has always been overlooked. It is true that the new staff were high-calibre but, with the changes taking place nowadays, even high-calibre staff need ongoing training.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the aim of this package of reform initiatives is to enhance the capacities and skills of our staff. It is the political duty of us all to make this reform a success if we want the institutions – particularly the Commission – to be able play their full role as the driving force of integration in the coming years. This is an ongoing task and it is called “The Future of Europe”. The guidelines which we have adopted today and which we will submit for open, thorough consultation with all the staff, are a substantial step forward in this direction.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, as I have said here before, the central purpose of the reform of the European Commission is to strengthen the performance, confidence and vital independence of the institution in order to ensure that the standards of service which the great majority of staff want to provide and the public has the right to expect are available to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset we have been working to fulfil that purpose by modernising structures and systems, by focusing more directly on priorities, by making unprecedented provision for the allocation of individual responsibility at all levels and by prioritising the use of people and of financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the twelve months since the Prodi Commission adopted the Reform Strategy White Paper we have achieved significant advance in all those areas. Many honourable Members are familiar with the details and I thank them for their very close interest. We will return to those details on future occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Compiling and implementing the very substantial changes has, of course, required immensely hard work and dedication. The people most directly involved have typically worked over 70-hour weeks throughout the last 15 or 16 months. I thank them and I pay tribute to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly commend the much larger numbers of staff for their diligent commitment in coping with extensive reorganisation and innovation – much of it very complex and testing – and simultaneously fulfilling the primary tasks of the Commission. Their ability and willingness to adapt to change is truly worthy of praise. It certainly contradicts the crude caricatures of the Eurocrat.</p>
<p class="contents">Such people need to have a modern working environment and progressive career prospects in order to enable them to do a good job even better, with more explicit recognition of their capabilities. That requires investing finance, time and effort. It also requires treating effective management, which is essential for a knowledge-based organisation like the Commission, as a core task of the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the college unanimously adopted a series of proposals and guidelines for fulfilling those objectives, including guidelines on a new, more linear career system and on pay and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">We will immediately carry out thorough consultations with staff and staff representatives on all these documents in the months until mid-July. These proposals are all available to the House. I will, therefore, briefly outline the principal purposes of the comprehensive changes. They are based firmly on the reality that the most valuable resource of any administration is its staff. The Commission is no exception and the fact that the general quality of staff is high is evident in the continuing essential policy performance of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The institution has not, however, used human resources policies that are appropriate to the changing responsibilities and needs of the institution as an organisation. Our proposals therefore make provision for changes to ensure, first, that officials’ careers depend primarily on their demonstrated abilities, their proven performance and their willingness to accept responsibilities and that they should all have the benefit of objective annual appraisal. Secondly, the changes should ensure that career development opportunities for all staff are maximised by removing glass ceilings and rigidities and by providing officials with career guidance, appropriate training and real possibilities for greater mobility both inside the institution and externally.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, they should ensure that managers are responsible for their staff, are given the support that they need and are evaluated on their achievements. That is a radical change in established custom and practice. We propose to make that change in all respects in the interest of managers, the people that they manage and the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the working conditions of Commission staff should better reflect the practices of national administrations in the Member States. Making provision for parental leave for Commission staff for the first time, improving working conditions and facilitating flexible employment arrangements such as part-time working are crucial to achieving equality of opportunity and practice and to improving career development.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, and finally, the Commission must progressively begin to make the necessary investment to ensure that staff can reinforce and broaden skills throughout their professional careers. We propose a five-fold increase in the budget available for training over the next five years. It will still not bring the Commission’s proportionate training expenditure up to the average level of European Union Member States. It will, however, be a significant advance that can be made without imposing undue pressures on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For the institutions to continue to discharge their obligations successfully they obviously need to continue to attract high-ability, multilingual staff, the majority of whom will spend most of their professional life in a public service outside their home country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is increased and increasing competition for qualified international staff in many areas including multilingual, multi-skilled secretaries, IT specialists, scientific researchers, international trade and market specialists, competition lawyers, financial experts of every kind and many more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the realities of expatriate work and life, of significant responsibilities and of rising demand for scarce skills must be reflected in the rewards package for the staff of the institutions. The results of a comprehensive independent study published last April commissioned originally by the Commission showed that the European civil service pay scale is higher than that of national civil servants, similar to that of comparable personnel in other international organisations, significantly lower than that of similarly qualified expatriate employees of multinationals and lower than that of diplomats. That reinforced our view that the pay scale is appropriate, reasonable and relevant to the role of the Commission and to the demands upon its staff and that in some respects improvement is necessary and justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for childcare for children under the age of six, for instance, is essential for equal opportunities and for the Commission to be able to attract staff, particularly women, from Member States with advanced systems. Similarly, payment of position premiums for functions that carry particularly heavy responsibility and/or workload is gradually becoming the norm in labour markets throughout the European Union. For the institution to retain its competitiveness as an international employer, it should be introduced in a targeted way in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With these considerations in mind we have reviewed the structure of pay and rewards in order to identify and, where necessary, reform the outdated elements. We are consequently proposing to cut or to end allowances which have no continuing justification and to keep and, in some respects, improve those which correspond to objective conditions such as expatriate working life, bringing up children and, typically, having to work in more than one foreign language. Our pensions proposals, meanwhile, fulfil our undertaking to guarantee the long-term actuarial balance of the system and, naturally, existing pension rights will be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">In compiling and adopting all of these proposals for consultation, we have naturally given close attention to budgetary implications. We have made very clear to this House and to the Council that all changes arising from reform and from pay and pension proposals will keep within the limits set by the relevant part of the Financial Perspective established by the Berlin Council in 1999. We will fulfil that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ending of the 5.8% so-called temporary levy, in place under various names since the 1970s, will provide a substantial part of the resources for meeting obligations. The savings on allowances that are no longer justified will make other investments possible. We propose that the pay and pension system continues to be based on the fixed relationship with pay movements in the civil administrations of Member States. The total employment costs of the administration of the European institutions is, as a proportion of the budget, 1.9% of that budget. That compares favourably with the average bill for Member States calculated on a like-for-like basis of 13.1% of budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the period of the Financial Perspective to 2006 the costs of the administration as a proportion of GNP will be lower than they were in 1985. The documents adopted by the Commission today are, as the President of the Commission emphasised, proposals for consultation. In keeping with the method which we have used on all reform-related proposals each of the documents will be the subject of serious and detailed negotiations with staff representatives and wider consultations with staff over the coming four and a half months.</p>
<p class="contents">Constructive suggestions for improvement will be welcome and, as the record plainly shows, we heed them and we are ready to include them before decisions are finalised by the college. When they are finalised the decisions relating to changes that do not require alteration of the Staff Regulations will be implemented. The other decisions, such as those relating to career structure, pay and pensions, will be submitted as formal proposals for legislation to the Council and to this House. Some, like those on appraisals and promotions, will require consideration by the Interinstitutional Staff Regulations Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this Parliament, as a legislature, as a budgetary authority and as an employer, will rightly have close interest in all of these developments. I would draw attention to the importance of the changes that we are proposing in respect of the career structure. This affects Parliament in respect of all the areas I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">One important aspect and, indeed, a prior condition to making progress on the career structure is that we must reach agreement on a multiannual framework governing movements in unit wage costs allowing the institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council to set a robust and structured framework for developing the careers of their staff. I am sure that Parliament will give earnest and informed attention to this and, indeed, all other elements of the reform strategy. At my hearing in Parliament in 1999 I expressed the hope that we would be partners for progress. That hope has been fully realised.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope our partnership will continue. I commend the proposals which were adopted unanimously by the Commission for consultation today.</p>

Therefore it is very important that he be here.</p>
<p class="contents">I drew up on behalf of Parliament a report, which was approved almost unanimously last year, in which Parliament warned the Commission that the reforms must be implemented as quickly as possible to avoid staff demoralisation and public disenchantment. I would like Mr Kinnock to explain how he is going to move these forward as quickly as possible, because that warning is as valid now as it was when Parliament approved the report a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is to ask Mr Kinnock whether he shares my great concern about the lack of interest being shown in his reforms by the Council. I have had a look at the agendas for ECOFIN and general affairs meetings over the last year, and there has been only one item about personnel, which was about freelance interpreters in March 2000. Would he share with me the view that, if the Council took more interest in his reforms, it would help their speedy and thorough implementation to achieve the end that we all want, which is the most professional and effective European civil service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reform should proceed as quickly as possible in order to avoid the demoralisation and destabilisation of the staff of the European public service. I agree with that even more strongly now than I did then.</p>
<p class="contents">In any reform process there is an unavoidable gap between original design and effective implementation. It is in the interest of everyone who wants progressive change, and the stronger institutions which that change will bring, to try to make that gap as narrow as possible. Nevertheless we first have to undertake full and thorough consultation and negotiation as a matter of courtesy to our staff but also to encourage the sense of ownership of reform which is essential to success.</p>
<p class="contents">The four and a half months that we have set aside for those negotiations and consultation allow us to work quickly but thoroughly. Secondly those decisions which are the responsibility of the Commission can be taken quite quickly after the end of that four and a half months, taking into account the result of those consultations and negotiations. We can then embark upon the changes probably by the end of this year. Others, however, must be submitted as formal legal proposals to this House and to the Council. That will, everybody anticipates, involve a year of negotiations on the detail of amendments to the Staff Regulations and the pay and pensions package, which will take nearly the whole of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">These delays are regrettable but obviously we want to ensure that we go through the full and effective system of democratic scrutiny both by the Council and this House. That is understood amongst the staff. It also means, of course, that the two-year rollover of the present system of pay and pensions will provide stability and security for all the institutions, which would not have been the case if the Council and Parliament had not agreed to our proposal on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, therefore, if the legislation rhythm is not subject to delay, we could be fully implementing several of these necessary reforms in full by the beginning of 2003. That in some respects is an optimistic scenario but we certainly will make every honest endeavour to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the Council point that Mr Harbour very fairly raises, I have to say to him that my view is slightly different from his. I understand his concern but I have the advantage of going to the General Affairs Council and having our proposals – I quote “warmly welcomed” and also having an extremely good reception in ECOFIN at lunch where the discussion was naturally quite intimate but immensely constructive. In addition, of course, I have visited a variety of Member States to ensure that governments, and indeed national parliaments, are fully informed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have encountered no sour attitudes. I have encountered some good arguments and we are always ready to engage in those. There will be more opportunities to attend the Councils but the Council wanted to see our proposals come to a state of reasonable maturity so that they were solid and worthy of the Council’s consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to address two problems. Following on from the first question, lately many Commission staff have started to shy away from decision making because of what lies ahead of them. Let me ask you this, what can you do to encourage the Commission staff to engage actively in decision making once more? Surely all the Commissioners have not only agreed on these steps but have also stated quite clearly that they will take on political responsibility for the reform measures they are proposing in their areas of work?</p>
<p class="contents">And my second question is this: you propose to externalise, i.e. outsource, a range of areas. Do you not see something of a contradiction between externalisation on the one hand, and your justified desire to create a unified and independent Commission staffing structure, on the other? What will you do, Commissioner, to ensure that externalisation does not lead to the fragmentation of this unified civil service? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not go into great length but just repeat the point that I made earlier that the willingness to adapt, under extreme pressure with heavy workloads and two very innovatory proposals, demonstrated by the vast majority of Commission staff in the last year is entirely to their credit. That does not signify a reluctance to make change. They need clear guidance. They deserve to have transparent decisions to work on, but nevertheless they have demonstrated in the context of extremely difficult circumstances sometimes that they are willing positively to engage.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people who, like in other administration in any democracy will spend time seeking opportunities to be pessimistic, sowing the seeds of doubt and harvesting bitterness. Such people are found in all walks of life – with the single exception of course of the European Parliament, I understand that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This means, although I know Mr Swoboda is not doing this, that the willing, highly professional, dedicated and, as President Prodi earlier said, highly-motivated civil service of the European Union can be misrepresented infamously in the press and elsewhere by a very small minority who are externally but not internally regarded as representative. I hope honourable Members will always try, even if sometimes it is difficult, to make a distinction between those people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the externalisation and the approach that we are advocating in company with several honourable Members from all parts of this House – and I pay them tribute – is certainly not a departure from the concept or practice of a permanent, independent and competent European public service. On the contrary, by defining our management roles effectively and by externalising the obligations to execute already determined policies in a highly accountable way, we are securing the permanence and competence of the European civil service and giving the European taxpayers the benefit of maximum flexibility in conditions of assured security. I hope that the House will continue to give its support to this process of externalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would agree with Mr Swoboda when he says that the staff currently feel great concern, despite your attempts to reassure us by telling us that it is only a minority. However, if I have understood correctly, the negotiations are going to start now, which should make it possible to bring the plan in line with the principles you advocate: merit, modernity and training. I should like, therefore, to ask three questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In your plan, how do you intend to take account of the multicultural reality of the situation of European Union officials who do not all have the same traditions in terms of administrative management? How do you think it will be possible for everyone to manage?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even if the implementation is a lengthy process – you have just mentioned the year 2002 – do you not consider it essential to put systems in place rapidly or, in other words, to phase in the implementation in order to restore confidence in the working methods and the motivation of Europe’s officials.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I feel that there is one area which we have failed to take into consideration and that is how do you take into account the priorities determined by the expert working group, which specified that two interfaces had to be reformed as a priority? This was the interface between the work of the administrative staff of the Commission of the European Union and, I would say, the decision makers, Directors-General and Commissioners. The second interface concerns the relationship between the administrative work of the Commission and those to whom we provide money or working methods, the methods of intervention of the European Union. What plans do you have in this respect? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To return to the question of demoralisation among staff: clearly, we have created a sense of insecurity this year. I am aware of that: it has been a difficult task but we could not do things any differently, for we have had to go right back to grass roots and review every job description, the fundamental objectives and also the issue of multiculturality. So why is it that this reform is so problematic? Because we cannot be content to copy or imitate blindly any of the national administrations: either we succeed in the ground-breaking experiment of combining the different traditions and cultures to create a single tradition and a single culture, or we will have failed in our task. Obviously, we could not – we cannot – accomplish such a process without going right back to grass roots and starting completely afresh. I am quite aware that this has caused concern and I take full responsibility, but there was no other option. Even today, our debate starts with an open proposal, a proposal that is not limited to points to adopt or reject but which is the starting point for a discussion – moreover part of our tradition – that will, in the future, become part of a tradition of public administration which is different from that of any individual country.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, we are still a long way from completing this reform – it will take the whole of the forthcoming year to implement it – but, as Commissioner Kinnock said just now, we should have completed the dialogue process, this process by which, together with the trade unions and staff, we are to establish our strategy, before July. We plan to have the definitive reference framework ready within the next few months, before the summer, the following stage then being to implement the individual chapters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to be brief I will simply say that the Committee of Independent Experts made over 90 recommendations. We have either met or exceeded all of the proposals made by the Committee of Independent Experts apart from literally a couple of exceptions which, put to the test of practicality, could not be pursued. I am happy to be able to report that included the recommendations relating to the relationship between Commissioners, cabinets and services, which in September 1999 as one of the first acts of the Commission under Romano Prodi’s leadership, became the subject to agreed rules which clarify those relationships. These are capable of being used by any of the parties to those rules, so we have a major advance in transparency which I think works to the benefits of services and Commissioners and Commissioners’ cabinets.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point, on the relationship between the Commissioners in administration and externalisation, I will not add much to what I said to Herr Swoboda, but the steps we have already taken to abolish the so-called technical advice bureaux and to establish the major new nascent agency, if I can put it like that, as a Commission service called Europe-Aid with the huge improvement that that makes possible in management and accountability is evidence that we not only took the Committee of Independent Experts seriously, but we also have taken very seriously the various reports from this House, particularly those associated with and worked on by Mr Bourlanges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must confess that this debate strikes me as rather odd, since the impression is surely being created that our European officials, however competent they may be and however hard they work, constitute a rather pathetic category that needs support on a number of levels. I am very well acquainted with the working conditions and salaries of European officials: they earn, certainly in the higher echelons, more than a minister, or even a prime minister in the national Member States, so let us not exaggerate.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is the following: I heard Commissioner Kinnock say that European officials enjoy a number of facilities that are no longer appropriate to the present time. I assume that he is alluding to the opportunity to acquire items like cars and drink tax-free. Can you say exactly what facilities are being abolished because you no longer consider them appropriate to the present time?</p>

I take great pride in the fact that our institution has, in a full and very exact account, set out everything there is to be said about the salaries, the career structure, and the allowance systems that have been available to European civil servants. I hope and I know that there are those who have this ambition that all institutions can emulate that practice and do so with great rapidity.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cars without VAT are concerned, expatriate workers working for all the European institutions have the right, granted to them by the Belgian Government, to purchase certain goods, including cars, free of value-added tax in the first twelve months after they are engaged and at no time after that. So far as the allowances are concerned, there has at present been a provision available to European civil servants since the 1960s which allows them to make transfers of parts of their salaries to their home countries. It originated because of the difficult and expensive business of making international financial transfers. However, over the years obviously transfers have become extremely easy. The real problem arises from the fact that a co-efficient was built in as a means of providing compensation because of variations between the different currencies of Member States. That has resulted in an imbalance of compensation which is why the system now makes heavy demands, or heavier than justifiable demands, on the budget and why we will bring it to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing applies to travel allowances established in the 1950s on the basis of the first-class rail fare of an official at least once a year, or even twice a year, to their home country. That was one thing when there were six Member States with contiguous boundaries and railway systems connecting them. That has changed somewhat. Consequently, a system that allows people to claim first-class rail fare twice a year to different parts of the European Union is no longer justifiable. We are radically changing that and bringing it into line with modern travel realities.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that custom will also be emulated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it was in French, but I have had it translated, so now I understand it too. That letter describes the process, now under way, of negotiating with the Turkish Government concerning democratisation as a run-up to the whole application and enlargement process. I should like to emphasise that it is now more necessary than ever to take action on this matter because, in addition to the problems by which it is already affected, Turkey is now faced with a severe political and economic crisis which will signify a setback for the democratic process and will mean that political prisoners in jails will be in an even worse position than they were before. Hence, this request – it is not Mrs Fontaine who is in the chair, but it is, of course, you who represent the Presidency – to the effect that this matter should once again be addressed and the Turkish authorities once again urged to set the democratic process in motion and move it forward instead of bringing it to a standstill, for what we are witnessing now is a retrograde step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are also aware that there are certain rules which apply when the issue of immunity is examined by the committee responsible, and that means that the relevant authorities within the country where someone is accused of certain conduct must have supplied this information. This was also the case in 1990, when your current group President was the President of Parliament.

I had two points. The first concerned the bombings in Iraq. You cut me off because the debate is to be held tomorrow, whereas what I was trying to tell you was that I have a proposal for tomorrow's debate and that is that we pass a resolution. I did not intervene during the discussion of the agenda so as not to intervene twice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns Moldavia. I read a report in the press about an unacceptable pre-election intervention by the High Representative of the CFSP, Mr Solana, in connection with Moldavia; taking account of the results of the election – in which the people of Moldavia voted freely and gave a huge majority to the Communists – I wished to raise the question of this unacceptable stand. Allow me to read it so that I can call on Parliament to take a stand …</p>

<p class="contents">I believed that the democratic parties had the legitimate concern of preparing for democratic elections. The accusation of electioneering applies to autocratic leaders, not to democratic leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that Mr Berlusconi is electioneering in Spain at this very time. And I must say to Mr Poettering, in view of his assessment of this situation, that he must have read and shared the opinions of some of the characters in George Orwell’s <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, and that you must believe that all the European citizens are equal, but that some, Mr Berlusconi for example, are more equal than others.</p>

I would add that the current function of the plenary sitting certainly does not make it the most appropriate place to go into a question which has been dealt with at length in the Spanish press and has featured in the Italian newspapers, which did, in fact, inform us about the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out, moreover, that we can have recourse to bodies, such as the Parliamentary Bureau, and to people with responsibility for such matters, such as the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the President of the European Parliament and the Secretary-General, who, I am sure, will be able to investigate what happened and discover whether anything out of the ordinary took place. The plenary sitting would not appear to be the most appropriate place to do this. I therefore feel that the best thing would be to place our trust in these bodies and wait for them to analyse the case properly, seeing as I imagine the matter is of interest to all the Members in this Chamber. I wonder whether the procedure used would have been the same for the least important Member of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, like Mr Poettering, am in complete agreement on the fact that matters relating to the internal affairs of Member States of the European Union should not be raised in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">It pains me, however, to see that the Spanish Member who quoted "Animal Farm" has clearly not read the book or, at any rate, has not understood its meaning, for the work in question condemns the totalitarianism of the Communist regimes: maybe the Member should consult someone who marches in the ranks of his group.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I hope that this incident will serve as a lesson for the future, and I call strongly upon the House not to use the European Parliament to broach matters of national politics. There have already been many interruptions of this kind in recent days, including that of the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, who spoke, totally inappropriately, on matters of Italian politics.</p>
