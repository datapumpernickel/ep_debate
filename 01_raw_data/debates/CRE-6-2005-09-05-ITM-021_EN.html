<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during August, six major accidents cast a gloomy shadow over commercial air transport throughout the world. Every one of them affected European passengers. Faced with these tragic events, I, on behalf of the entire Commission, would like to offer my condolences to the victims’ families and to assure them of our profound sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reacted immediately to the accidents by stepping up its contacts with the civil aviation authorities of the Member States concerned in order to gather together all relevant information. The Commission dispatched a group of experts to Cyprus in order to assess, at the scene, the air transport situation and to identify the specific needs and difficulties. The Commission contributed towards having an action programme adopted by the managing directors of European civil aviation, who met in Romania on 27 August. Over and above these reactions, however, we must continue to act resolutely in increasing air safety, in order to enhance passenger confidence and, furthermore, to confront the rapid growth in air traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Community measures are vital. In actual fact, the main objective of an initial proposal in the transport sphere was to increase air safety. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission will strictly monitor whether all the Member States correctly implement existing Community law. In this context, it will instruct the European Aviation Safety Agency to carry out inspections of the competent national authorities. It is imperative that these authorities perform all of the required checks and dedicate the necessary resources to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to lay emphasis on pursuing and strengthening legislative initiatives. We must improve transparency for the benefit of passengers and to do that we must draw up a Community black list that will need to include all carriers that have been grounded. Such a measure will enable us to inform the public but also to avoid different approaches from one Member State to another. In actual fact, banning measures must be enforced throughout the entire EU territory and must be taken on the basis of a common set of criteria. In order to achieve this, the Commission must be able to promptly extend the banning measures taken at national level to the entire EU territory: citizens from across the whole of the EU must have the same guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Regulation on the identity of air carriers, which was submitted to the European Parliament in February, offers the possibility of promptly implementing such a measure, and at this point I should like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac, the rapporteur for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who took the initiative to complete the text proposed by the Commission and on which the Council of Ministers issued an agreement in principle. Thanks to the work of your Committee on Transport and Tourism – I take advantage of this moment to also thank its chairman, Mr Costa – we will be able to have a far more comprehensive system at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerns the mechanisms for monitoring third country aircraft, which must be strengthened immediately. Ramp inspections must be more comprehensive and better targeted. To achieve that, the Commission will very shortly submit proposals aimed at transferring to the European Aviation Safety Agency the management of the safety assessment of foreign aircraft - I am referring to the SAFA programme - and at implementing an early warning system between the Member States, the EASA and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Community must have at its disposal a coherent and uniform set of rules covering all safety-related issues, and, in order to prepare and implement those rules, the role of our European Aviation Safety Agency must be consolidated. In this context, I am going to propose a new regulation from autumn extending the remit of the Agency to encompass third country air operations, pilots’ licences and aircraft. This extension will allow the European Aviation Safety Agency to intervene effectively in order to ensure that both European and third country carriers are monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for my fourth point, Madam President, I would like to stress that moves to strengthen the European aviation safety system must be accompanied by actions relating to third countries and to the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The safety standards in force outside the European Union must be raised. The European Union is prepared to continue providing its technical assistance to developing countries and to play a major role within the ICAO. Only this morning, I received a government minister from Latin America, to whom I explained that we were at the disposal of the States concerned to assist them in strengthening technical cooperation in this area. I also hope – I say this before Parliament – that the European Union can occupy a place as such within the ICAO, precisely in order to play an even more decisive role in increasing safety levels.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, I can state that, even before the serious accidents that took place this summer, the European Union, through this draft Regulation on passenger information, had already anticipated the need to offer passengers the opportunity of knowing the identity of air carriers. I hope that the entire text, which has been enhanced by the work of your committee, can promptly be adopted by Parliament and can receive the approval of the Member States. In this way, we can actually have a black list by the end of the year, based on a set of criteria harmonised among all of the Member States. We will thus negotiate a decisive stage in improving the safety of air transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Christine De Veyrac, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>The tragic events of this summer and what has again taken place this morning give us – as you said, Commissioner – a real responsibility to promptly adopt new measures in order to improve the safety of air passengers and the information offered to them. Contrary to what the recent accidents would suggest, air safety has not declined over the years and aeroplanes remain by far the safest form of transport in the world; let us be realistic, a zero level of risk does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The high increase in air traffic could lead to a rise in the number of aviation accidents and in the number of deaths, with some experts even predicting that by 2020 there will be on average one accident per week. That is unacceptable. Prompt and effective action must be taken, and it is the duty of Parliament and the European Union to protect the safety of Europeans as far as possible. That is why we, like the United States is doing, must put right the existing shortcomings and make provision for a European system which, alongside the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), would do more to increase air safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the draft report that I presented on Tuesday before the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I requested, in particular, that a black list based on a set of objective safety criteria be drawn up, which would be valid throughout the entire EU territory. The most satisfactory solution for the user is to publish one single Community black list, which is updated by the Member States but which concerns the entire airspace of the EU without singling out the Member State behind each measure. To ensure that this list of banned air carriers is enforced throughout the entire EU territory – you have spoken about this, Commissioner – the criteria on the basis of which the list will be drafted must be drawn up at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">These common criteria based on objective safety considerations would be laid down by the Commission, assisted by a group of experts from the Member States. Every carrier included in the black list will be grounded throughout the entire EU territory, as it is unthinkable that a carrier could be declared deficient and allowed to transport passengers. The same level of safety must be guaranteed to Europeans, no matter which Community airport they depart from. The proposed system would enable us to strengthen coordination among the civil aviation authorities of the Member States, while leaving it to those authorities to take the initiative regarding safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The other strand of this report lays down the obligation to inform passengers about the identity of the actual air carrier and creates rights for them in certain specific cases. It is desirable, furthermore, to promptly entrust the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) with a key role in checking that the international and Community aviation safety standards are observed, by making it responsible for issuing safety certificates for third country carriers. That is why the European Commission must propose an extension of the Agency’s powers and I am pleased to have heard Mr Barrot announce that this proposal would be presented in the autumn. The EASA should also have the opportunity to monitor the various national civil aviation authorities, to carry out audits and even to manage a European database that would gather together the details of all of the checks carried out by the Member States on aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am delighted that it has been possible for the vote in plenary on this report, initially scheduled for January, to be brought forward to November which, in the event of the report being, as I hope, approved at first reading, will enable the regulation to be adopted at the Transport Council of 5 December, that is to say before the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In just the one month, August, we had the spectacle of five air accidents, and no sooner has September begun than something similar has come to pass. What this again highlights is not only the sad topicality of the debate around the Commission’s proposal for a regulation on information for airline passengers, but also the urgent need for rules to enhance safety in the air transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of greater security, the rapporteur, in her report on the proposal for a regulation, went much further than the Commission proposal, and so let me extend my especial congratulations to her on it. I welcome in particular the demand for a single shared list based on shared and harmonised objective criteria, as well as the associated demand for a flight ban to be imposed on the airlines on it. Many of those airlines that do not abide by European safety standards are less interested in flying than in making money; they must be listed, publicly shamed, and punished.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right that I should, at this point, mention and welcome the latest initiative by France and Belgium, whereby lists are to be published of airlines banned from flying in both French and Belgian airspace. It has to be said, though, that this again shows us how important it is that the criteria and the list be harmonised; for example, no airline appears on both the French and Belgian lists. As it is a fact that members of the European public do not travel only within the EU, I see the option of including worldwide airlines on this list as indispensable, or else the information will not really be relevant to them. Passengers also need to be informed as to who is in charge of the flight, and they need better and easier access to information about safety deficiencies. It goes without saying that there should always only be one person to whom the passengers can address their concerns or with responsibility for dealing with them.</p>
<p class="contents">As, however, any regulation without consequences would be an ineffective one, passengers must be in a position to draw their own conclusions. It would be logical for them to be entitled to cancel their booking and receive not only the price of their ticket but also compensation, but there must also be the possibility of going beyond flight bans and imposing sanctions on the airlines in the form, for example, of administrative penalties if they fail to comply with the obligation to provide information. I am glad that we can expect the Commission’s support for this, and that everyone in this House acknowledges that it is imperative that this regulation be transposed as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before this August, we were probably all satisfied with the air safety situation throughout the world and with the EU’s evident ability to be in the forefront in this area. That is due to the fact that its rules are stricter than those imposed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) internationally; the fact that standardisation and aircraft control issues are now entrusted entirely to the European Aviation Safety Agency; and the prospect that we shall also be dealing with air freight organisations and crews in the fairly near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The air accidents in August 2005, however, require us to act with greater urgency and greater ambition. It is a pressing need to which we must not fail to respond, since the number of victims is constantly rising: the serious accident that has happened today in Indonesia means that this tragic August is not yet over.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all that, I believe that we have to recognise that the area of air safety is, amongst others, an absolute priority. It is a goal that has to be pursued without too much concern for national competences – which are now meaningless – and we must leave behind the rather slow progress that has been made so far in defining objectives and procedures, which equally does not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a situation in which air traffic is growing rapidly and people respond with whatever is available, using any kind of aircraft, but the dangers are becoming increasingly evident. There is much to do and we have to act fast. If, in this debate on its future, there is one area of European Union competence that quite clearly lies at Community level, I would say that it is safety. We have to take this road, so that even the Member States understand that the sooner they transfer their powers to the European Union in this field, the better it will be for everybody and the more effectively action can be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, what can we do? We can implement the Commission’s specific proposal to inform passengers of the details of the aircraft actually being used, by providing them with additional information.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, if with this report we succeed in guaranteeing that everybody has the same control criteria, the same safety standards, and the same blacklist of non-compliers applying throughout the EU, with objective, transparent criteria for adding and removing names from the list, then we shall have transformed something that was originally a means of helping consumers into a real instrument for taking action in the field of safety. We are aware that it is not enough: at the same time, the Commission must set out the overall strategy that it intends to pursue. I am convinced that Parliament – and the Council too, I hope – will agree to follow it so that as soon as possible we can ensure that we meet the expectations of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result of this has been major misgivings on the part of the passengers and the European public as regards the quality of airlines. Lamentably, some of this lack of trust is justified; it must now be banished, and for that, consistent, clear and rapid action will be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Barrot has already said, the checks will be inspected and we will devise common criteria for blacklists. I am very glad of that and regard it as quite fundamental. Even today, though, I already hear voices from the Member States saying that some of them will not be ready to accept common European criteria, their argument being that these will, as usual, be weaker than their own and thus, perhaps, encourage more propaganda against the European Union and its policies. We have to have clear, stringent and comprehensible criteria to prevent that happening. They are among the fundamental requirements. We have to achieve the highest safety standards possible; that is something we owe to the passengers who rely on us, as, indeed they should be able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">That third countries should participate in this is something I regard as self-evident. I also know how difficult that can be, not only for reasons of immediate safety, but also because of the need to prevent what has, unfortunately, happened to some degree in maritime transport happening in aviation, where airlines must not be allowed to operate under flags of convenience. It follows that, for the sake of credibility, every effort must be made to get airlines from third countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Things have got to the point where consumers cannot find their way through the market. We must make it transparent by means of shared and clear lists. We also have to equip consumers with information, with consequences and with the right of cancellation, for only then will airlines take the necessary action immediately and without delay. As we see it, the credibility of the EU is at stake. The protection of airspace and of flight passengers must be given absolute priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to take this incident and the accident which claimed so many lives in Greece on 14 August, involving an aircraft operated by a private company in which 121 of our fellow human beings lost their lives prematurely, as my starting point for pondering on the image of the air transport sector recently.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been six international accidents which have cost the lives of approximately 625 people since the beginning of 2005. In the last month alone, 500 people lost their lives in four accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, a few years ago, the former Commissioner for transport maintained that the air transport sector required stabilisation and proposed that the number of national carriers in the Union should be reduced. Unfortunately, this is where the biggest problem lies in this sector. The persistent will of the European Commission to liberalise the sector has resulted in deregulation and unbridled competition, all at the expense of citizens' safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The new environment being created, with the uncontrolled entry into the market of private capital and the plummeting level of services provided, have caused a drop in safety standards, which cost companies money.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do, therefore, and what comes within our jurisdiction, is to amend the air transport directive and the relevant regulations, so that there are no repercussions on safety issues in the companies' fight for profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I arrived there very quickly as a journalist and as a private individual. It was a sickening sight. You cannot begin to imagine what we saw. Children cut to pieces, burned, families wiped out; one family lost five people.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall convey your condolences; but are your condolences enough? Will the families, some of whom are close friends, tell me what the European Union did to prevent the accident? What controls you carry out? Why did you not do what you say you are going to do now about black lists last year or the year before or six months ago?</p>
<p class="contents">Did we need to mourn 121 people at the heart of Europe in order to realise? Do you not know that there are 'Mickey Mouse' airlines in Europe? Do you not know the conditions under which charter flights operate? Do you not know that Turkey violates Athens FIR with fighter planes and that you are in constant danger when you fly down there? Do you not know all that?</p>
<p class="contents">All this, and yet you are closing down national airlines. People trust in Al Italia, in Lufthansa, in the big companies. Now you are closing down Olympic Airways because, apparently, the Greek state is financing it and there is no competition with these 'Mickey Mouse' companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got a thousand islands, many of which have airports. Who will fly there in winter? What planes will fly there? You are not going to finance the planes that fly down there to people cut off from the capital. We finance them and it is precisely because we help Olympic Airways that you are closing down the company and directing us to companies with a brief to kill even more people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the philosophy which prevails in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We want answers here. We want safe flights at long last. You said that you sent experts. Did you send a flight safety expert? No one visited the scene of the accident. You said they went to Cyprus. No one came and those who did, your people under your supervision, told us they hardly know a thing about Pipers or Cessnas.</p>

<p class="contents">The demand being made by public opinion in Cyprus and, I believe, in the whole of Europe, is that investigations into the exact causes of accidents should not be restricted.

The Member who has not been following the debate has to be told that – as the Commissioner said – Europe is not reinventing the wheel. It has to be said that the Commission presented us with the regulation under discussion even before the accidents. It is evident, though, that it is only the one speech that interests him; the matter in hand is of secondary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to work towards guaranteeing the citizens of the EU, and the air passengers among them in particular, safety in every conceivable respect. To put it the other way round, that means that there is no room in European airspace for airlines that do not take safety seriously. That is why it is important that we should, while addressing this regulation on airlines with the utmost seriousness, pass it into law as quickly as possible. The rapporteur has explained it. The proposals are excellent, and, if we combine our efforts, we really can get it over and done with very quickly – at first reading, indeed. We have established the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is meant to guarantee a high standard of safety, but must also be given authority over aircraft from third countries. We will of course need a list of the black sheep, a blacklist – and not 25 lists, but one single list with standard criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I already have one for it. Last week, a pilot with the company FlyAir took a defective aircraft back to Paris-Orly airport, but, instead of giving him credit for this, the airline gave him the sack. That means that we already have one candidate for the blacklist, and I hope that the Commission will do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Commissioner, I would say that he and his fellow-Commissioners should, in their deliberations, also consider the idea that, not least from the point of view of safety, the bargain airlines might perhaps be tackled a little harder than they have been in the past. Apart from that, we are side by side on what is very much the right road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us consider, though, the rules we do have: the directive on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports (SAFA) is only one year old and is yet to enter into force. The agency is only three years old. The proposals you are tabling now should have been dealt with at the time when the Commission incorporated a huge number of the items, many of which were rejected, often by the Member States. You will therefore not meet with any resistance from us if you ask for a wider role to be given not only to the agency, but also to the European Union, in the person of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at the moment politically incorrect to say that Member States should allow their national policies to be coordinated and controlled by the Commission and the European Aviation Agency, but it is in the public interest that we should continue to do so. I think that Parliament will accept this view, but I hope that this time round, the Member States too will be somewhat more accommodating. I hope that the Council will approve Mrs De Veyrac’s proposals by the end of this year so that we need not wait another seven years, as was the case with the SAFA directive, which was submitted in 1997 and was not approved until 2004. This time round, such a thing would simply be unacceptable. We must, as a matter of urgency, have this black list and all criteria in place by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens of Europe rightly expect us to respond swiftly and flexibly to recent events. For this reason, I support the proposal of a Community-level list drawing European citizens’ attention to airlines that fail to meet safety requirements.

<p class="contents">Many reasons have already been cited, and I would like to add yet another one. A variety of unofficial lists have appeared recently, in the pages of a major French daily newspaper, for example, and on the Internet.

It has happened that the names of a number of audited national air traffic control bodies and airlines that guarantee proper safety standards have also been included in the list published by the newspaper. This is unacceptable. I therefore urge that the legislation should enter into force immediately after its adoption, and that proposals should be put forward for the transitional period as regards any lists countries intend to publish officially at national level.

<p class="contents">I believe it is essential to set standards for control, and we must act firmly on this point. I should like to add, however, Commissioner, without just restating what other Members have already said, that I hope that all this really will be included in a programme with greater strategic scope, so that Europe may play a leading role on the world stage in the area of air safety as well.</p>
<p class="contents">If we analyse the frequency of accidents in the various regions of the world, it emerges that – not by chance – North America, Europe, Japan and Australia have the best records, although there is still much to be done, while Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean have the worst. The problem is certainly one of carriers, but it is also above all a problem of air bases, since a carrier’s performance depends on the attitude of its management – the relevant aviation authorities – with regard to safety. In other words, a carrier from the Persian Gulf or Asia that operates in a relatively rich catchment area will devote greater resources to the safety of its airline.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, I believe that Europe should put itself in a position to protect its own airlines from increasingly cut-throat competition, by focusing its competitive edge on raising safety levels and not lowering them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any case, rules need to be laid down urgently, and, unfortunately, it is not the first time that our Parliament has insisted on this. Yet, the Member States have often turned a deaf ear. I would insist on four requirements. The first: rules banning high-risk aircraft and carriers, and even the introduction of prior authorisations to be able to take off from, and land on, EU territory. The second requirement: the strengthening of checks in terms of number and quality. The third: the obligation to provide users with information and transparency. Finally, the fourth requirement, which I hope can be included by the Commission, is to improve the level of protection offered to employees who oppose the hazardous operations of their carrier and who should also have the right to withhold their labour. </p>
<p class="contents">It has taken a large number of tragedies for the Member States to publish black lists. I believe that everyone here is in agreement in saying that the black lists must be European, and that each time a Member State decides to ban an air carrier, the other Member States must be able to automatically enforce the same ban. I believe that we must go further, however, by calling for a genuine principle of authorisation enabling the European Union, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in particular, to establish whether or not the carrier and the aircraft used comply with our safety rules. I emphasise this point because a large number of circumventions can occur through a change in name and statutes, even when black lists are drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, I would emphasise the need to mobilise the Member States, as it has often been Parliament and the Commission that, together, have tried to improve the situation. May the unacceptable and dreadful tragedies that we have witnessed serve as a lesson to those in power in our various countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to express my horror at the accidents that have taken place this year, which have wiped out the excellent results of 2003 and 2004 at a stroke, and which, while it remains the case that the air sector is one of the safest sectors, have brought back to the fore the urgent need to resolve significant questions about how to impose legal frameworks, controls and limits on globalisation, so that it does not become a process of increasing insecurity and fear, of half-truths and trade and flag wars within a context of a serious lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgent that we are able to safeguard a development that many of our citizens have enjoyed: the popularisation and democratisation of the possibility of travelling long distances in order to visit one’s loved ones, to work, to get to know different places and cultures, to enrich our lives. It is therefore essential that we work quickly and well and, to this end, I am pleased and hopeful about the improvements being proposed to the Regulation on passenger information. Furthermore, we would also like to reiterate that we are in favour of establishing common criteria for producing a European black list with the greatest possible transparency and publicity and which furthermore is uniform and serves to supplement the proposed improvements in the OACI. It was very successful in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige,</span> in a different field of action, and also in relation to the improvements in the OACI; that is therefore what we propose, and we hope that the Commission will also achieve this in the case of air safety.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, certain important question marks. When we have established the rules, we must apply them, and this raises important questions in the social field: what will happen about crew training, which has been shown to be essential in terms of preventing casualties in an accident such as that which took place in Toronto? What about the confidence and guarantees that must be given to pilots, the greatest experts in safety, who are often penalised by their companies? What about the technical reviews and inspections that are often not even carried out in our Member States, but rather in third countries, even in the case of important national airlines?</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to clarify all of this, so that our work may serve as a tribute to the victims, and so that this type of accident does not happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they do not appear to have been caused by the sort of terrorist action or attack which we have been focusing all our attention on preventing here over recent months. On the contrary, it would appear that they were caused by a fatal combination of human error and mechanical fault.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the European Commission to immediately extend its independent investigation to an examination of all airlines in Europe, to include two additional aspects:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the very serious matter of the intensification of the working hours of both flying and ground airline staff over recent years, which certainly affects flight safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the ratio between flying time and maintenance time for aircraft which has come about in each airline over recent years again, I suspect, at the expense of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, people are more important than profits. If, unfortunately, Europe has a tendency to forget this in numerous sectors in Europe for the sake of unbridled competition, it is time it was reminded of it, at least where human lives are at stake. We must not wait for tragedies to happen in order to act; we must act before they happen.</p>

<p class="contents">We had, moreover, already thought ahead, since it was in February that I proposed to the Commission that it adopt this draft Regulation on passengers’ rights, which included the obligation for the Member States to provide any information they had on suspicious carriers. As of April, this starting point was followed by an agreement in principle from the Member States. Yet, this summer has demonstrated the need to go beyond what the Member States had agreed to. I myself had approached the Member States with a view to laying down a common set of criteria and I had still not been able to convince them completely. I would like to thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism, and Mrs De Veyrac in particular, for its excellent work. We can now hope to benefit from control standards, to ensure that a ban in one Member State extends to the entire European Union, and even, at Commission level, to add a defective carrier to the black list, if necessary. Mrs De Veyrac has also mentioned the overall set of data which, at European level, will be far more significant and will enable far more effective action to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Costa, whom I also thank, has insisted that the Commission be willing to provide an explanation of its overall strategy. I am at the disposal of his committee with a view to listing all of the parts of this strategy: third country aircraft, the regulation that you are going to adopt, the SAFA Directive that must be transposed into national law before April 2006, and, finally, the new draft Regulation that I will present to the Commission at the end of September with a view to entrusting the European Aviation Safety Agency with additional powers. This strategy must be outlined as clearly as possible, and I will endeavour to ensure that this happens. In actual fact, it is by means of an overall strategy that we will obtain the required outcomes and that we will put pressure I state this clearly on all of the carriers in order that they themselves also genuinely agree to subscribe to this increased safety effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piecyk, in particular, has stressed the fact that we had discussed the easing of restrictions. Let us not forget, however, that the effect of an increase in competition was a certain decrease in tariffs, which opened up air travel to young people and to people on tighter budgets. Air travel became more democratic as a result of competition. Yet, of course, there can only be competition in this area if it is subject to extremely stringent and clear regulation. I thank Parliament for offering us assistance to ensure that this regulation takes effect and is a great deal more specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx also talked about third countries. Why have we taken so long? The Member States, in fact, had very often clung on to their national powers and had difficulty in accepting a certain transfer of powers to Community level. Today, the lesson has been learnt, and Parliament and the Commission must henceforth be able to convince, or finish convincing, the Member States that European powers are crucial, not in order to take away national powers, but to check that those national powers are exercised, with the necessary means and the required determination. That is how we will succeed in establishing a European air safety space.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have also raised the issue of employees. The new proposal for a regulation that I am going to present will also include provisions enabling the European Aviation Safety Agency to deal with equipment, pilots, pilot training and flight plans, in such a way as to be able, as it were, to give the crew members both the training and the authority they need to set flight plans and to prevent people from making demands of them that are scarcely, or not at all, compatible with safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that is the plan that we must now carry out promptly, as many people have stressed, because we can no longer show Europeans evidence of a lack of determination in this area, a state of affairs that would be reprehensible. I sincerely thank all of the Members of Parliament who were willing to take part in this debate and I already see it as the sign of a quality item of legislation that should be swiftly adopted in order for us to become operational by the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
