<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, what is the purpose of this joint resolution? Surely it is to establish a proper and public judicial process against the thirteen members of the Jewish community in the Southern Iranian town of Shiraz? The European Parliament in no way disputes the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to react against foreign attempts at espionage and where the burden of proof is decisive, to punish them accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, however, that the arrest and imprisonment of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz up to now has been a real caricature of a normal judicial process, a process that the constitution of the Islamic Republic itself actually provides for. What fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the Iranian authorities? To start with, a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused. For example, proselytising against Islam and the joint teaching of boys and girls, a violation of the customary separation of the sexes in education in that country. The latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox Jewish community in Shiraz. Finally, the official accusers raised the almost stereotypical subject of spying for ‘America and the Zionists’, which means the state of Israel. And so these thirteen Jews are being threatened with the death penalty. And remember, this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole affair in the meantime smacks of the unremitting power struggle between the reformist camp around President Khatami and the conservatives around revolutionary leader Khomenei – by trampling on a defenceless Jewish minority of about 30 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">What position should the European Parliament take in this tough, domestic political struggle with regard to the specific case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz? Of course, it goes without saying that we should support those Iranian powers that publicly declare that they are striving for a society based on the rule of law and human rights and who are open to contact with the West. This fundamental choice involves, at the same time, not giving the hard-liners in the Islamic Republic any excuse to undermine this promising path of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration. Iranian fundamentalists will immediately attack the European request to Teheran to support the complete abolition of the death penalty – note that this is a provision that runs directly counter to Islamic law, the sharia, as a renewed attempt at the pernicious westernisation of their own Islamic Republic! And, in their view, the abolition of the sharia is equivalent to the abolition of the present Iranian form of government. In short, this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must not, therefore, give ammunition for propaganda in this matter of life and death to the ultra-conservatives in Iran, who, in the last few years, have quite simply been pushed onto the defensive by Khatami and his followers. What we have in mind is a clear legal settlement of this tragedy, ending we hope with the release of all prisoners. That would really add a happy chapter to the almost 2500 years of history of the Jewish community in the land of the Persians. God willing, that is what we shall see!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylla (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the trial of thirteen Iranian Jews accused of espionage has opened today in Teheran. The trial is taking place behind closed doors. These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about. Their lawyers, some of whom are state appointed, were only allowed to look at the files the day before yesterday. There is no guarantee of the right to a defence. I am afraid this may only be a mock trial. Yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">When the case started, we had the privilege of hearing some leading government dignitaries publicly call for the prisoners to be put to death straight away. This case, which was built up from nothing – I think we are all convinced of that – has mobilised international public opinion powerfully. With strong feeling all over the world, including in Strasbourg today, the international pressure has had some impact because the Iranian leaders have softened their position, in particular announcing that most of the accused would no longer be appearing on the charge of espionage, tantamount to execution. Three have been freed on bail. Finally, the court announced this morning that the trial was being adjourned until 1 May, which is a step forward, at least. But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">The government’s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well. They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute. It is also clear that the outcome of this trial partly depends on how the Iranian political situation evolves. In the last parliamentary elections, in February, the reformist tendency defeated the conservatives who include the most extremist elements. So this trial is starting at a significant moment: on the one hand, Iran is signalling openness and progress, on the other, the conservatives are trying to hang on to power by every means at their disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen Iranian Jews will be used by one faction against another, in step with domestic conflicts. Justice has little place in that kind of battle, and human rights even less. So it is imperative that we react. The European Union is based on the values laid down in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a member of the UN, Iran should be applying them too.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must demand the release of the prisoners: the thirteen Iranian Jews, but also the other eight Moslem prisoners and the students we know absolutely nothing about. We must also call on the Union governments to do the same. We also demand that observers be permitted to attend the trial, because public hearings are fundamental to holding a fair trial. Finally, we must make it absolutely clear that the development of our relations with Iran will be subject to respect for human rights in that country.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The charge was espionage, but their real crime was being Jewish.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, a new trial is starting in Shiraz, in the South. Thirteen Jews and eight Moslems have also been detained for a year in Iranian jails, facing death by hanging. The youngest is only sixteen years old.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in September, Parliament resolutely called for respect for the fundamental rights of these prisoners in terms of a fair, just and public trial, with their own lawyers and with international observers present. When the more moderate elements won the last elections, we thought our call had been heard. But now there is this parody of a trial, a summary procedure behind closed doors before a revolutionary court presided over by a single judge, and a cleric at that. As for observers, so far Teheran has not granted any visas. In other words, we are disappointed, disappointed and alarmed. We are continuing to insist that the international community be able to follow the proceedings from start to finish. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, at the request of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the European Parliament is urgently calling on the Council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners. There is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved. Our feelings are as strong as our concern. We must make ourselves perfectly clear.

At that time, in an effort to reassure us, the Iranian Government told us it was not a racist trial because many Moslems had also been arrested and indicted on the same charge along with the thirteen Jews.</p>
<p class="contents">But the trial opening today only involves the Jews. They are being tried separately from the Moslems charged with them, which proves, if proof were needed, that this trial – which we are told is to be adjourned – is no genuine trial.</p>
<p class="contents">You will remember, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and it has been mentioned, that some Iranian Jews were arrested for spying for Israel a few years ago. They were put on trial for it and hanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Who are the accused? We should point out that they include a cobbler, a cemetery caretaker, a boy who is not even sixteen yet, and two old men. It is hard to understand how these people are endangering Iranian democracy. What are they supposed to have done? No one really knows! We do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done. A letter to a family in Israel may have been enough to set this case in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous resolution and in repeated letters supported by the President, we asked to be allowed to visit the prisoners. That was refused. We then asked to meet the families who are not sworn to secrecy, as far as I know. That was also refused. We asked – in a unanimous resolution – to be able to attend the trial. Up to now that has been refused.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise the immense risk run by these thirteen people and strenuously reiterate our requests to send observers to this trial and be given access to the evidence in the case. We must also make clear our intransigence on relations with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we are not going to wake up, some day soon, and find that these thirteen people have been executed because they were Jewish.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with all the previous speakers. But I also support the massive protests that have been taking place for some time throughout the world in connection with this affair, such as today at 6 p.m. in Brussels in front of the Iranian embassy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is a special day, 13 April 2000, the date of the so-called ‘trial’. In 1979, 1993, 1998 and 1999, resolutions were sent from the European Parliament to Iran, but what happened to them? Via Amnesty International, Jewish families and organisations, we learned that, on 8 March 1999, thirteen Iranian Jews and Muslims were arrested and detained. The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight. The reason: espionage. Yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">Requests have been made to send letters, but to no avail. The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Levy, sent a letter to various ministers, including the Belgian Minister, to point out that these people are in no way guilty of spying. They are Hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals, among other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Three of the thirteen have been allowed to choose a lawyer and the others have had lawyers forced upon them. I heard today at 11.30 a.m. that the forum of Jewish organisations in Belgium says that there will not be a trial. The Jewish communities are afraid. What is likely to happen? People disappear, they are locked up, but for how long? Either that or they are used for cattle trading. It is very worrying and must be followed up. I hope that Iran will act wisely and responsibly and not with hatred.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community. Therefore, we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Iran. We know that there will not be a free trial; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation.</p>

We are using diplomatic channels to try and ensure that the death penalty is not imposed or, more to the point, is not carried out. We feel that such an occurrence would put both relations between Israel and Iran and stability in the already sensitive Middle East to the test, which is why the European Parliament must send a strong message to Iran today, a message stressing the need to respect human rights, respect the international conventions which Iran has signed and grant a moratorium on the death penalty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that this message gives an important signal to the Turkish people. But – and it is an important but – before negotiations can begin, a good many changes are required in Turkey, especially with regard to human rights. Many of us had hoped for improvements in this area. It is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis. Turkey has signed international agreements on human rights but, as has become bitterly apparent to journalists, writers, human rights activists and opposition politicians, these are not observed. </p>

These were his words to us then: “For five months we have had a new Turkey. Now that the country has acquired candidate country status, we see opportunities for democracy and freedom in our country. In addition, the internal armed conflict has ceased and our relations with Greece have improved”. Those were Akin Birdal’s words.</p>
<p class="contents">Akin Birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed ‘ill health’. However, he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy. He also, of course, forfeited the right to be chairman of the Human Rights Foundation. His so-called crime was that he had spoken about the Kurdish people on World Peace Day. Because of this crime, and in accordance with Article 312 of the law in force, he was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment and ordered to pay fines. </p>
<p class="contents">Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man. He still suffers from the after-effects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 1998. In the course of our conversation, he said that he wanted democracy and a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question and that he saw the value of EU membership. He also commented on how important it was to abolish 152 laws and articles which limit freedom of expression and cause so many people to be put in prison. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Birdal was re-imprisoned the day after our conversation and after we had spoken with Prime Minister Ecevit about him. What we are seeing in this case is how an undemocratic system imprisons, persecutes and oppresses democrats. That is why, in our resolution, we are demanding that measures be taken swiftly to guarantee freedom of expression, reform the judicial system and release all political prisoners.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1998, he survived an assassination attempt by right-wing extremists, but since then his health has greatly deteriorated. He is now in prison again, at the very time that a number of our MEPs visited Ankara. From Mr Schörling’s statement, it appears very clear that this is in no way coincidental. It is real provocation. Through this kind of action Turkey alienates itself from Europe. The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round. If Turkey wishes to heed our call, then it can only respond by releasing Mr Birdal because this is out-and-out provocation.</p>

<p class="contents">This is not the first time he has been arrested and an armed attack has been made on his life; he escaped with his life, but he was unable to leave the country and was rearrested. Leyla Azan is still in prison, and so are thousands of Kurds. When will this end? There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government. The KWP has stopped fighting and its leader, Mr Öçalan, is calling from jail for peace, reconciliation and recognition of the cultural identity of his people. The European Union has accepted Turkey’s candidacy and now the Turkish Government must respect our agreements and conventions. We must explore every possible avenue, save military interventions and embargoes, starting with a refusal to sell Turkey any more arms, so that, at last, democracy and freedom can be established in Turkey. </p>

This is especially true of Tibet, where, for the time being, the Dalai Lama’s reasonable five point plan has no chance of finding its way onto the agenda. The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye. The United States presented a resolution on the violation of human rights in China at the fifty-sixth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. </p>
<p class="contents">We are extremely concerned by the fact that the Council of the Union has also not yet announced its intention to support this resolution, and this may not be coincidental, since the EU-China dialogue on human rights is at a complete standstill. We call for an end to this policy of turning a blind eye to events in China, and for the European Union to join the American initiative without worrying about losing choice economic opportunities, and to cease this silent and tolerant stance towards the continuous violations of human rights in China, and, in particular, Tibet. Europe is laboriously and extremely inconsistently shaking off her lethargic attitude to the horrors taking place in Chechnya. I sincerely hope that she will follow the example of the United States and, at last, wake up to the human rights situation in China.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Members of the European Parliament agreed, together with the Foreign Minister of the Tibetan government in exile, the US government official responsible for Tibet and members of national parliaments, that it is time we put an end to shady compromises with China for the sake of maintaining purely economic relations. The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and political repression is on the increase. People are being mercilessly persecuted, and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed. Tibet’s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated. These continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States needs the support of the European Union at the 56th UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The European Union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights. If it takes the first step, other countries, including the candidate countries, will certainly follow suit. My own group, the Group of the European People's Party, is firmly convinced of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, Europe needs to stick its head above the parapet. The Commission and the Council belong at the head of a movement fully supporting the Dalai Lama’s five-point peace plan. Point one: Tibet must become a peace zone. Point two: China must finally renounce its policy of expulsion. Point three: democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities. Point four: Tibet’s culture and environment must be protected. Point five: genuine negotiations must take place on Tibet’s future autonomous status.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise: respect for human rights. You demonstrated in Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, and I was there to see for myself, that you know how to build bridges. How did a Tibetan delegate put it? “We will survive because of your moral support, but above all because of your solidarity”! <span class="italic">Tashi delek!</span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet. In 1992, I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament. It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds, lamenting the same poor, nay appalling, conditions in Tibet. The Tibetans’ human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction, especially in Tibet itself. Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of Tibetans have no human rights, let alone civil rights. Above all, they have no right of assembly, no freedom of association, and no right to freely practise their religion. For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet’s political and religious leaders, on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this. But I would like to stress this point: if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies, then we should really be supporting them, as they are setting an example for our own European Union model!</p>

In my opinion, the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights, we always focus on individual rights and too often disregard the rights of peoples. The fundamental right of self-determination is all too often ignored, possibly for reasons of political convenience. It may be easier to act in defence of a person who has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured or denied freedom of speech than in defence of an entire people. But this is the crux of the matter: until the right of self-determination is declared and applied everywhere, we will continue to witness such situations and we will continue to debate and adopt resolutions, but, as Mr Sakellariou said, sadly, nothing will change. We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples, for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right: all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire, from the Sahara to Chechnya, from Taiwan to Kurdistan, and, of course, in Tibet. </p>

Things are changing in the United States.

I do not see the motion for a resolution that we are about to vote on as simply yet another resolution, but as further proof that things can change.

Most recently, we discussed the Mumia Jamal case, and now it is the Juan Raul Garza case, among others. However, these men are just examples as there have been so many that you could say that the USA, in its legal policy, is almost waging war against its most destitute and most marginalised people. In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China, Congo and Iraq. You may well feel that it is strange to sit in a near half-empty chamber, apart from the visitors, and discuss such an important subject, but I think it is a subject which we must continue to take up, and I would ask the Member States to also respond to it here, to respond swiftly and in no uncertain terms to this so-called friendly state which repeatedly violates the most basic human rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I find particularly distressing is the fact that young people as well, people under 18, can also be sentenced to death, and even the mentally handicapped can be sentenced to death. Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary. In the case we are discussing here it was not life imprisonment that was imposed, but the death penalty, and that is on the basis of facts that were not proven beyond any doubt. For that reason even the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked for time to re-examine the case and to be able to issue an opinion, and it also asked that no date be set for an execution. We must urge the Americans to act not only in this specific case, but to ensure that the death penalty is abolished in their country. Together with a few other countries where democracy is a long way off, they are the only ones where the number of death sentences is rising. This is by no means an enviable record. Our Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has repeatedly argued in favour of the abolition of the death penalty, not only in this specific case, but in general. More specifically, I would ask our American friends to abolish it once and for all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA – over 600 since 1977 – but this would be the first federal execution since 1963.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important because this is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved, unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence. Juan Garza's death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico, which he was never charged with.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row: 14 are black, 5 are white, one is Asian and one is Latino. We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Governor Ryan of Illinois, as we have heard already, has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process. That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US. In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963. That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a presidential campaign under way. In a presidential campaign executions, regrettably, become a political football in the US. President Clinton has the opportunity – he is not standing for re-election – to make a stand on this issue today.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The death penalty is a political arm used by the American Government apparatus to settle accounts with militants like Mumia Abu Jamal. Like the whole prison system, it is also an instrument of social discrimination because Afro-Americans, ethnic minorities, and more generally the poor, are far more at risk than others of being condemned to death. It is also a penalty whose irreversible character makes any reparation impossible if a mistake is made – and mistakes are often made. A government which makes legal assassination one of the pillars of its justice system is infinitely more criminal than those it claims it is protecting society from.</p>
<p class="contents">The death penalty expresses all the barbarity of a society organised in a way that also condemns so many children and adolescents, even in the richest country in the world, to die from drug use or insecurity, actually from material and moral poverty, simply because they had the misfortune to be born in a poor area. On a planetary scale, that barbarity condemns millions of human beings to die of hunger or disease when they could easily be cured – but they are not cured because they do not get the medicine they need. </p>
<p class="contents">In rising up against the death penalty we also rise up against all that barbarity, against the barbarity linked to permanently organising society so that all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a minority and the great mass of humanity is condemned to poverty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So for the Portuguese, being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture. I would like to remind you of another reference: the US Declaration of Independence, an inspirational text which defines the three rights on which the United States war of independence was based: “the right to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness”. Some two hundred years on, the right to life has still not been fully recognised in the US legal system and this deserves a strong reaction on our part.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes, for defeating national socialism and communism, and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent. Nevertheless, the existence of the death penalty in the USA means that they could not join either the Council of Europe or the European Union. That means that we should tell even such an important partner as this one, in no uncertain terms, that they should finally abolish the death penalty at individual state level and all the more so at federal level. The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this. Sad to say, just the opposite has happened, and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue. However, we believe that the Atlantic Alliance is founded on democracy and the rule of law, so that the right to life should form the centrepiece of the legal system in both the USA and in Europe. That is why we want to state unequivocally in our Charter of Fundamental Rights that we support the right to life and that we are opposed to a culture of death as typified by the death penalty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of us who speak should remember that every word of our speeches and the resolution will be eagerly read in Zimbabwe within the next 48 hours by all sides. We must, therefore, all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May.</p>
<p class="contents">The old parliament was dissolved on 11 April and President Mugabe pledged at the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo that the elections would go ahead. It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set. This could take up to three months.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, when the elections are called, observers from Europe will be invited to Zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings. This would show real transparency. It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation. African countries must work together to consolidate their future. However, the old Lomé Convention made democracy, human rights and the rule of law a requirement for development aid. The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance. All we ask is that disputes of any kind be settled through courts and not in open conflict. I particularly highlight land issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe has much to gain from the Partnership Agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief. Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement. It is disappointing that Zimbabwe feels the need to be involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when precious resources could be spent on domestic requirements, such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">We all look forward to the rule of law being strengthened and a democratisation process fully operating under an independent judiciary to allow civil society to express its wishes through a fair and open press. The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in South Africa. At the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from Zimbabwe. There are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy. The court rulings were ignored. I sincerely hope that the ruling that was taken about an hour ago, that the police must act against those occupying the farms, will not be ignored this time, as was unfortunately the case with other court rulings. What is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason. The only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of President Mugabe.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, Mr President, is a recipe for anarchy and a threat to democracy that could endanger the entire region. We therefore believe that elections must be held as quickly as possible, preferably under the supervision of international observers so that everyone can be satisfied that they are held as fairly as possible. Land reform is necessary. There are many landless farmers and unemployed people in Zimbabwe. It must, however, take place lawfully. Above all, it should not occur along racial lines and it must certainly not be the case that holders of political office of whatever party be given priority in the distribution of land.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to say something about the war that is currently raging in a certain part of Africa. I agree with Mr Corrie that the money for this war could be better spent on development in Zimbabwe, on education, training and health care. One can think of a whole range of things.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people have, over the last few years, shown that they deserve our confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is a country which, since independence in 1980, has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe. Not only in the economic sphere, but also politically, with a degree of press freedom in which the leadership of the country has also not been spared from criticism. As one of the leading SADEC countries it was at the forefront of the battle against apartheid in South Africa. It would be particularly sad if this country of all countries became the victim of war, racism and civil strife.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe does, of course, still have considerable problems, but the European countries and the Union will continue to assume their responsibilities as partners of Zimbabwe in jointly tackling the problems of poverty, ill health and under-development. These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo. The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources, as is evident from the economic situation. Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems. Land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government, and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections. These have been announced for June at the very latest. I hope that nobody will use the current problems as a pretext – by exaggerating and increasing these problems, for example – to postpone the elections and heavily influence the spontaneous development of this movement. In my view, Zimbabwe deserves our confidence. The population has chosen the path of development. I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this. With this in mind, we support the resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we have a reasonable common position. Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa, so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage, just prior to the elections, exactly as he has done in previous elections. After all, this issue is so important for so many black and poor people. The elections are therefore necessary. The rule of law is necessary. You need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what other speakers have said about the SADAC countries who will no doubt be looking upon this situation with great concern and who are undoubtedly working behind the scenes to maintain a democratic climate. It is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the Congo. Could the Commission and the Council help us, as the European Parliament, to remain involved as observers at these elections, because if things go wrong in Zimbabwe, there will be more trouble in the region. After South Africa and the democratic government there and the sound developments that have taken place in the region, we very much need to see the positive side. Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute. In the run up to the elections, Mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents. At the beginning of this month, peaceful demonstrators were attacked by his followers while the police looked on. What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms. Whites are being systematically intimidated and driven from their land through violent means to punish them for their support for the opposition and to buy the votes of the landless farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The government systematically disregards the rulings of the Supreme Court. In fact, the public prosecutor warned that any attempt to remove the occupiers could lead to civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Mugabe, who has become unpopular through his mismanagement of the economy and his exploits in the Congo, intends to do everything necessary to stay in power. Some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">At long last, the European Union has this week threatened to suspend aid if the President does not keep his promise of free and fair elections. But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged. A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates. The President is still not allowing any foreign observers in. What else has to happen before structural aid is suspended? I would urge the Council and the Commission not to wait until it is five past midnight.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the European Union. We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now. The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again – Hitler is out and about again there. It should not go unnoticed that the leader of the band that is encouraging these arbitrary acts in Zimbabwe chose the name Hitler as his own name. He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai ‘Hitler’ Hunzvi. We know that the instigator is the President of Zimbabwe himself, but the leader of the movement took this name, a name that we know all too well from the horrors of our own history. This is what is happening in Zimbabwe. That is why we have to take more vigorous action. The chaos, the threats and the intimidation taking place in that country are unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that this is being encouraged by the person holding the highest office of state, the President of Zimbabwe himself.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The concern expressed in Parliament’s motions for resolutions on human rights in Iran is entirely shared by the Commission. Like you, we are particularly worried about the fate of the thirteen Jewish and eight Moslem Iranians detained under this strange charge of espionage. A number of approaches were made last year by the Union and by various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Consultations at Union level are continuing, along the lines of the motions for resolutions, in order to establish the most likely ways of guaranteeing the fair and just trial we all hope to see. Further approaches and the possible presence of observers at the trial could, in our view, be part of that perspective. So we share the attitude expressed in the debate by those of you who said that, given the progress observed in Iran since the recent parliamentary election, we should, as far as humanly possible, avoid giving the impression of foreign interference which could be counterproductive and which might reverse the improvement we believe we are seeing in the internal and external political climate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Akin Birdal, again we fully share the concerns that have been expressed during the debate and in the resolution on the return to prison of Akin Birdal, ostensibly to complete his sentence. We entirely support the declaration of 30 March by the Union Presidency, inviting the Turkish Government to take steps to secure the release of this activist. As you mentioned during the debate, the Helsinki European Council confirmed Turkey’s status as a candidate country on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries. So it is important for Turkey to engage resolutely in the democratisation process and adopt the necessary reforms in terms of human rights. Revision, or even repeal, of Article 312 of the criminal code, which was referred to earlier and which is the basis on which Mr Birdal was found guilty of, and I quote, “incitement to hatred”, seems absolutely essential in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the regular report it has been producing since 1998 for Turkey, like the other candidate countries, the Commission is following the human rights situation very closely. In our last report, published in October 1999, we were already expressing our concern about the provisional nature of Mr Birdal’s release, with good reason, unfortunately. So we will continue to follow up the matter, in the context of the detailed examination we carry out every year.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we are currently working on a membership partenariat with Turkey, within the framework of the pre-accession strategy. This document, which establishes the list of priorities to be met by Turkey in preparation for membership, should be adopted by the Commission next November. By the end of the year, Turkey will need to adopt a national programme reflecting its own priorities for the partenariat and listing the resources put in place to achieve them. So we have some important deadlines coming up and, in the Commission’s view, questions relating to the democratisation process, in particular freedom of expression, will have an important place in the examination of this partenariat.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards human rights in Tibet, we also share your concern. Like you we are worried about the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of Tibet, which the Chinese authorities clearly do not respect. As we have done, with you, many times before, we call on China to re-enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama. We regard the renewal of this dialogue as the only realistic method of achieving a peaceful and durable solution to the Tibetan question. </p>
<p class="contents">To respond to Mr Mann, the Union has raised these matters many times in the context of the specific bilateral dialogue it is holding with China on human rights. The situation in Tibet was also one of the main items on the agenda at the last summit between the Union and China, held in Beijing last December. We will doggedly continue to raise the case of Tibet with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the death penalty in the United States, like many of you, the Commission is concerned about the growing number of people condemned to death and executed in the United States since the reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976. In 1998, opposition to the death penalty became one of the most high profile factors in the whole of Union policy on human rights. We are engaged in permanent dialogue, not only with the United States Government, but also with the other American authorities concerned, in particular the governors of the states where the death penalty has not been abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is delighted with the Governor of Illinois’ decision to establish a moratorium on all executions pending in that state, and we hope that decision will mark an important stage on the road to the abolition of the death penalty in Illinois.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of condemning innocent people to death, mentioned by Mr Ryan, Governor of Illinois, is one of the essential principles underlying the Union’s position on the death penalty. And we are hoping – we have started – to encourage all the federal states in the United States which apply capital punishment to think about that risk and introduce a moratorium like the one in Illinois with a view to achieving abolition of the death penalty throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the particular case of Juan Miguel Garza, the Commission is currently working to clarify the facts through our delegation to Washington. On the basis of that clarification, and in accordance with the 1998 guidelines, the Commission will decide whether a specific approach to the American authorities is needed. The American authorities should be expecting one. They are fully aware of the whole Union’s opposition to the death penalty and all executions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Zimbabwe. I will rapidly pick up the four points that have been raised in the debate: the elections, the future of our cooperation, the intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo and finally the violence perpetrated in connection with agrarian reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections. As regards the possibility of sending a team of electoral observers from the European Union, the Commission recognises the long experience of the European Parliament and the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly in this type of exercise, and particularly that of certain Members of Parliament who are present and who have spoken in this debate. </p>
<p class="contents">All the same, we doubt whether such an initiative would be effective in view of the uncertainty surrounding the election preparations. At this stage, one aid formula would be to intensify civic education, local training and observation of the elections. The Commission is involved in the last stage of a project designed to train over a thousand local supervisors of the electoral process and we have made contact with our partners from the Southern African Development Community, SADEC, to define their role, and find out whether sending in an observation team from SADEC could be envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question concerning the possible suspension of our cooperation, although there could be grounds for suspending financial cooperation with Zimbabwe under the Lomé Convention, we take the view, for the moment, as indeed does Mrs Maes, that such a measure would run counter to our goal prior to the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the government’s macroeconomic results are mediocre to say the least, the Commission, the IMF, and the World Bank have already frozen their support for structural adjustment, and the backers participating in the agrarian reform have suspended their institutional cooperation plans. We have done that, but we continue to support the population re-establishment programmes aimed at combating poverty, and we think it is appropriate to maintain the anti-poverty aid approved in the 8th EDF framework for the social sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">On Zimbabwe’s intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we support the Lusaka peace agreement which calls for a status quo of the forces present and a ceasefire in line with the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards agrarian reform, since February the Union has been taking various steps in reaction to the recent deplorable events in the country, presumably at the instigation of the Zimbabwe government, such as the violent occupation of farms and non-respect for diplomatic immunity. In the last few weeks there has clearly been an intensification of illegal occupation and an increase in violence and intimidation, particularly directed against the opposition. Regrettably, we interpret these disturbances as forming part of the governing party’s election campaign. Like the European Parliament, we utterly deplore them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
