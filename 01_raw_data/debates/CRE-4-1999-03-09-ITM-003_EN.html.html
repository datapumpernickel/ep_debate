I am disputing the debate on this text on two essential grounds. The first is that it is intended to make some of the proposed changes to the Rules of Procedure in implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam. People may say that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been ratified, or just about. But one country, France, has not yet ratified it, and it would be discourteous to my country"s parliament to make changes to our Rules of Procedure before the Treaty has been formally adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all, and this concerns all the Member States of the European Community, a treaty which is an essential instrument of Community law cannot enter into force until it has been formally ratified by agreement of the Heads of State and Government of all the Member States. However, clearly none of the Member States has yet exchanged instruments of ratification, to put it in diplomatic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that while it is the responsibility of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to apply the Treaty of Amsterdam, or rather the draft Treaty, which should soon be ratified, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has gone way beyond that. The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which is our fundamental document, must be subject to basic laws, in particular the Treaty. In my minority opinion which I submitted on this text I list the points where I think the report goes too far. I shall not go into them now, but those are my reasons for asking Parliament to make a decision on my motion of admissibility.</p>

<p class="contents">The first was on the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Changes to the Rules of Procedure obviously cannot enter into force until the Treaty has itself come into force. What we are doing here is preparing Parliament for that time. Clearly the provisions of the Rules of Procedure that are linked to the Treaty will not apply until the Treaty of Amsterdam is itself in force. It is also clear that Parliament needs to prepare for this as it is a complex matter. We cannot wait until the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force to work on the implementation of the Rules of Procedure, and that is why I think Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy"s objection is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point was whether we have gone too far with these changes to the Rules. We have actually taken advantage of the work relating to the Treaty to adapt a number of our Rules to new circumstances. I believe a parliament"s most fundamental right is to adapt its rules to the constant changes in parliamentary life. For this reason I cannot accept Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy"s second point either. In my capacity as chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure I therefore urge Parliament to reject Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy"s objections.</p>

In such circumstances, Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy should restrict himself to voting against certain amendments if he feels they should not be adopted in the context of this revision of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the first question, Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy is well acquainted with the nature of statutory law. It has the privilege and also the duty of regulating the internal running of an institution. The institution in question is therefore not merely advised but required to take appropriate measures in anticipation of the entry into force of the Treaty. It needs to draw up internal rules that will be compatible and consistent with the Treaty when it enters into force. It is this Treaty of course which establishes the guidelines for the development of these internal statutes. I therefore believe that his first objection is not acceptable either, Madam President.</p>

It does not simply deal with the necessary transposition into Parliament's Rules of what is contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam. It takes the opportunity, as we did after the Maastricht Treaty, to review the whole of Parliament's working methods and its procedures. In short, we are preparing Parliament for a new era.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has traditionally taken the treaties and tried to stretch them like a piece of elastic. We cannot contradict the treaties, we cannot do things that are forbidden by the treaties. But the treaties inevitably allow a margin of appreciation, a scope for interpretation. They leave space and gaps to fill in. Parliament has always tried to do that in order to make the Union more effective, more open, more transparent and more democratic. That is the philosophy that underlies this revision of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if you stretch elastic too far it can snap and you can hurt your fingers. But I am convinced that the package that we put before you today has stretched the elastic to just the right degree and that what we have come up with is a package which we can commend to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">After Amsterdam Parliament will be an equal part of a bicameral legislative authority with the Council, at least for the areas subject to codecision which will include most non‐agricultural legislation. Much work has therefore gone, in this report, into improving and redefining our legislative procedures. This includes technical improvements to simplify the way that we vote in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The codecision procedure has been rewritten in our Rules, partly to take account of what has been agreed in Amsterdam: the possibility of first reading agreements between the institutions, for instance; the elimination of the Council's right to adopt a text unilaterally at third reading if Parliament fails to reject it. These changes are incorporated into the Rules and we have done so in such a way as to encourage early dialogue between the Council and Parliament to try and reach agreement early in the procedure, wherever possible. We have also highlighted the cases where it is the final vote in Parliament which will henceforth determine the entry into force of European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In another area we have looked at the new provisions giving Parliament the right to vote on the President of the Commission. This new legally binding vote is highlighted in the revision of the Rules by describing it as the election of the Commission. We want to underline the fact that the Commission, the Commission President and, later, the Commission as a whole are politically accountable to Parliament. The Commission is not an unaccountable bureaucracy as some eurosceptics would have us believe. The Commission is a political executive accountable to the directly elected Parliament. This, too, we have attempted to highlight in the revision of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must look, too, at the developing Common Foreign and Security Policy and sharpen its procedures for monitoring, scrutinising and controlling that policy. The Rule changes do this. We have taken up a number of suggestions made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy in this regard. They include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We provide for the High Representative to enter into a dialogue with Parliament, to come to Parliament to explain his or her statements, to go before the relevant parliamentary committee and for Parliament to monitor the procedure for appointing a High Representative.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put new provisions in the procedures for dealing with what we could call ‘atypical legislative procedures": Third Pillar procedures and Schengen procedures, legislation adopted at the request of the social partners under the Social Agreement, legislation proposed at the initiative of a Member State under Article 67 (1) of the Treaty, suspension of a Member State, and legislation adopted under enhanced cooperation. All these will now have a precise procedure allowing parliamentary involvement in what would otherwise not obviously be the case under the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to reform Parliament's internal voting procedures so that less time will be spent – as we do so often, spending hours – voting in plenary. We have brought in a number of technical changes which would simplify the way that we vote in plenary, without diminishing the rights of Members or groups of Members to table amendments. We hope we have come up with a balanced package there.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to rationalise our procedures in other ways. For legislative reports, for instance, there would no longer be explanatory statements. They would be replaced by short justifications for each of the amendments tabled to a Commission proposal, as we already do for the budgetary procedure. Similarly, opinions from other committees would be confined to tabling specific amendments. This would focus our work specifically on the legislative texts and the changes that we wish to make to them and away from long discursive texts where Parliament's opinion is not always clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Topical and urgent debates would be rationalised as well, in that the subjects chosen would be agreed when the agenda is adopted on the Monday and not by an ad hoc procedure one day later. This will leave more time to prepare the debates properly and that, too, would be a small but significant step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">New rules would ensure transparency of Parliament's proceedings at all levels and guarantee the public a right of access to EP documents. Here we are following up the recent report on openness and transparency by my colleague, Mrs Lööw.</p>
<p class="contents">We also eliminate the possibility of late challenges to the legal base of proposals, when this challenge is only made at the last stage in plenary as a way of having the matter referred back to committee and to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. We have a rationalised procedure there, which preserves the right of the Legal Affairs Committee and of the committee responsible, leaves the final decision in plenary but avoids the possibility of filibustering.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of enhancing our scrutiny of the Commission, we also provide in our new Rules for the President of the Commission or another member to come and make a statement to Parliament immediately after Commission meetings, where we so request it, and to be subject to a half‐hour period of questioning on the decisions taken at that meeting. That would again illustrate the accountability of the Commission to Parliament, but would give the Commission the possibility of informing Parliament directly, rather than the press, of the decisions it has taken as our executive. The initial announcement of the decisions taken would be here and the initial reaction would be by directly elected Members posing questions to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also try to liven up parliamentary debates. At the moment we have debates, as you know, by long lists of speakers. We have experimented with what we used to call the Delors procedure, where for an hour the President just gives the floor to individual Members who catch the President's eye. We codify both systems in the Rules of Procedure – neither of them is explicitly there at the moment – but we would allow for the possibility of combinations. The debate could start with the usual rounds of speakers from each political group, but an hour, half‐an‐hour or even just ten minutes could be left at the end for a few extra speakers to come in by catching the President's eye, so that Members who have sat here throughout the debate, patiently listening to the arguments, could come in and respond at the end; somebody who has already spoken might wish to come back and respond at the end. This would liven up our debates a little bit, make them appeal more to the public, without taking away the right of each group to have its appropriate share of speaking‐time.</p>
<p class="contents">We also provide for the Rules of Procedure to be rewritten, where necessary, in gender‐neutral language. It was International Women's Day yesterday and I know that many of our female colleagues take offence at the fact that the Rules in some languages refer only to Members in the masculine form – as he and not as he or she – and the rule changes would also cater for that particular problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also minor things taken up in these rule changes. I shall not go into all of them. A lot of minor details are tidied up and we seek to improve procedures wherever possible. Individually, many of these changes are minor but cumulatively they will improve Parliament's working methods and its procedures. They will also make Parliament more open and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">This package has been put together over almost a year – a year of hard work in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities. I must pay tribute to my co‐rapporteurs, to Mr Fayot in his capacity as chair of the committee, in which he has had a trying time but has handled it extremely well; to all the members of the committee and, indeed, other committees which have tabled opinions and proposals to us, and, last but not least, the secretariat of the committee, which put an enormous amount of work into this report.</p>
<p class="contents">After a year's hard work, I am confident that we have put together a package which is fair, balanced and can command a virtual consensus across most of the political groups of this House. I have no hesitation in commending this package to the House.</p>

I confess, however, that I lack the self‐discipline to forego the opportunity of addressing the House and reading the speech I have prepared. As a result, you will already have heard some of what I am about to say.</p>
<p class="contents">As the explanatory statement points out, we are dealing here with a proposal to amend our Rules of Procedure. This revision was prompted by the changes required to prepare for the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It aims to establish new working methods and procedures allowing the House to respond to the legislative requirements of a new era which will bring further challenges and responsibilities for the European Parliament. The package also sets out to promote the powers of this House as much as possible within the framework of the Treaty. As befits the nature of the proposal, this has been a long process. We now find ourselves at the appropriate juncture – in the run‐up to the ratification of the Treaty – to present the proposed revision to the House. A great deal of thorough preparatory work has been undertaken. Though this has not attracted unanimous support, it has certainly generated a solid consensus on the vast majority of the amendments tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">As this lengthy and fruitful process draws to a close, it is only right for us to express our appreciation to all those who have made it possible to come this far. I should like to thank the members of the secretariat of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure who have coped intelligently with a huge amount of work. The working members of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure are to be congratulated too for demonstrating the will for positive cooperation throughout. The results achieved are proof of this. The representatives of the various political groups have also helped to achieve this consensus. Mr Fayot, the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, deserves a special mention, as do my two co‐rapporteurs, the very able Mrs Palacio and the tireless Mr Corbett.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of my modest contribution I should like to highlight certain points which I believe to be particularly important. The first of these relates to Amendment No 16 to Rule 32 and Amendment No 17 to Rule 33 on voting by roll call on the appointment of the President of the European Commission and the Commission itself. It will not have escaped Members that integrating these provisions of the Treaties into our Rules of Procedure is of great political importance, as Mr Corbett pointed out. This clarifies Parliament"s role in the appointment of any future European Commission. Similarly, Amendment No 23 to Rule 39, which in fact takes up but slightly modifies Amendment No 152 by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, rendering it more flexible, ensures that the European Central Bank will make the maximum amount of information available and makes formal provision for its statements.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, and as a result of Amendments Nos 30 and 31, the Rules will provide for consultation of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions with the necessary distinction between these two institutions to take account of their respective identities. The heads of both Committees have been consulted on these two amendments and have responded positively, suggesting that in addition to the provisions of the Rules, it may be appropriate to draft a code of conduct regulating exchanges between the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to highlight the proposed inclusion of a new Chapter VIA providing for regular exchange of information with the national parliaments of the Member States. As I said at the beginning of my speech, we have here a carefully crafted proposal for a far‐reaching revision of our Rules, adapting them for a stage when the European Parliament will have greater legislative powers and significant political responsibilities, such as in the election of the President of the European Commission. It is to be hoped that tomorrow"s vote will represent a satisfactory outcome for the work that has been carried out.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, as the two rapporteurs who preceded me have already indicated, this revision of the Rules is first and foremost a way of regulating our work in the House, as are the Rules themselves. The result should reflect the interests of the House, the concerns of all the Members and also the concerns of those who work behind the scenes undertaking essential tasks, to whom we have already paid tribute. In this context, I should like to add my voice to those who have congratulated the other two rapporteurs. They worked as a team on a task where natural differences of opinion actually make the work even more challenging. I should also like to congratulate the technical services, principally those attached to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. However, congratulations are also due to all of Parliament"s services, and in particular to the officials of the Group of the European People"s Party, who have given me tremendous support.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I referred to our Rules as a way of regulating our communal life, and the lodestar of parliamentary activity. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the Rules of Procedure have a much more important role to play. They are a symbol, a banner, a programme and a point of reference. They are the internal constitution of this institution; they summarise and reflect how Parliament wishes to present itself and the role it sees for itself in the interinstitutional balance. They represent all that Parliament has stood for throughout its short but fruitful history, and anticipate the part it would like to play in the process of European integration. Consequently, any revision of the Rules of Procedure must inevitably take account of the Treaty, bearing in mind however that there is considerable scope for interpretation when applying the Treaty to existing situations, as there is with any legal instrument. The Rules must be practical and realistic, whilst retaining their emblematic value. They must enshrine respect for all, for groups – both large and small – and for individuals. They must also establish a definitive balance between the inertia carried over from when this House was merely a parliamentary assembly without power and its new role as a colegislator which is to all intents and purposes on an equal footing with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">All the amendments are important, Madam President. The most minor detail of parliamentary Rules of Procedure can have far‐reaching political consequences, as we have seen recently. Nevertheless, the amendments can be grouped into three main categories, according to their nature.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there are those of a directly political nature that have direct political consequences. Among these, I would highlight Amendment No 15 on the composition of the political groups. It will doubtless be criticised, but it is in line with the concept of European integration. If we are moving towards greater integration in Europe, it does not make sense to have a group composed exclusively of Members of one single nationality in a Parliament whose function is to represent all the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 16 on the election of the President of the European Commission has also received a great deal of criticism. I do feel that here, we have respected the spirit of the Treaties, as should be the case. We have taken advantage of the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that Parliament"s vote on the appointment of the President is an integral part of the process, and this is reflected in our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth mentioning the statements on the broad guidelines for economic policy laid down in Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as well as Rule 24 which fully exploits the opportunities provided by the text in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go into details on the High Representative, as his or her function has already been extensively debated. Nevertheless, I should like to support my group"s amendment which clarifies the situation and, I feel, does away with certain somewhat arbitrary features of the current Amendment No 129. As regards relations with other institutions, I would emphasise that relations with national parliaments will be strengthened, as will relations with the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee. I should also like to highlight Amendment No 28 on interinstitutional agreements which enhances the status of these fundamental acts which are so important to us. Above all, they are rendered more transparent, legally sound and directly accessible to all.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned transparency, and the new Chapter XVIIa has been referred to in this connection. It clearly reflects the new guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam. There are many other issues I could mention concerning the third pillar, human rights and compliance with the principles of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to move on and deal with the second group of amendments, albeit briefly. These amendments have a direct bearing on the new legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that all these amendments have a dual purpose. They aim to promote interinstitutional relations, to foster the joint but unregulated efforts being made by the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and to streamline and update existing procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning for a moment to the issue of the legal basis, the Group of the European People"s Party has tabled an amendment in this connection, together with the Liberal Group.<br />In my view, the Committee on Legal Affairs" right to review has so far proved very useful and should be maintained. We must remember that any dispute concerning the legal basis can as a last resort lead to a case before the Court of Justice. The Committee on Legal Affairs" right to review must therefore be maintained, together with its special powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I referred earlier to inherited inertia, and this leads me to the third group of amendments, to which Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy referred. Given that Parliament was previously a parliamentary assembly with no power, it retains a number of earlier procedures. Some of these have already been streamlined, whereas others are in need of further reform. The will is certainly there. There are certain outstanding reforms which do not go beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam but which are an inescapable consequence of the Treaty as they involve bringing Parliament"s earlier historical functions into line with its recently acquired role of colegislator. An effort has therefore been made to make speaking time and resources more efficient, and to simplify and update procedures through the use of new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, now that I am discussing resources, new technologies and speaking time, my own speaking time has elapsed. I firmly believe that although this is not a perfect document, and despite the fact that I personally do not support all the amendments, the package before us is a clear representation of what this institution stands for, its energy, its vitality and the role it seeks to play at the heart of European integration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on their joint report amending the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament in the light of the Amsterdam Treaty. It contains an enormous amount of work which will underpin Parliament's ability to use its powers to the full and, as Mr Corbett says, stretch them to the limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people in this Parliament describe the Rules Committee as like watching paint dry in 11 languages. The fact that many people believe this is demonstrated by the speed at which the Chamber emptied when you said that we would be talking about rules. Nevertheless, I often think that the Rules Committee Members are the stagehands of this Parliament – the unsung heroes without whom the political stars of this institution would lose their lustre.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett and his colleagues have very adequately outlined the thrust of their report. I want to concentrate on aspects of the nine other reports by the Rules Committee that have been taken simultaneously, particularly the series of amendments relating to issues concerning the declaration of Members' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">With the passage of the Nordmann report and my own report on control and registration of lobbyists in 1996, this Parliament made an enormous step forward in transparency and openness. We now know that every Member has five shadows behind him. There are 3 000 lobbyists trying to shape the views of 600 Members. A dialogue with the representatives of employees and employers, consumer groups, producer groups, representatives of foreign governments and environmental and human rights organisations is both necessary and desirable. But dialogue should not turn into ownership. Members cannot be seen as products on the shelves of some kind of political supermarket available for purchase by those who have the money. In these reports a number of holes in the system are being filled in.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Amendment No 10 from my own report deals with the plight of former Members. We currently have an ambiguous situation in which some former Members are honorary Members, which has led to confusion in the past, with people considering them as senior Members of this institution rather than ex‐Members of the institution. My amendment gives the Bureau the job of laying down the rights and privileges of former Members without distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have Amendment No 110 in the Wijsenbeek report which changes the rule on declaration of interests so that Members with a direct financial interest must orally declare such an interest before speaking in committee or plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment No 112 in the Spiers report will make the chairs of intergroups responsible for making an annual declaration of any assistance in cash or kind received by such groups and making that available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Amendment No 111 deals with two problems. Firstly, with the failure of a small number of Members – 9 for 1996 and 21 for 1997 – to complete their declaration of Members' interests. It would mean that, after a final warning given by the President, their names would be published in the Minutes of our proceedings and then, if they still failed to comply, they would be suspended from the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared. At the moment there seems to be a great deal of ambiguity on what constitutes the level at which declarations should start.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 2 from Mr Vecchi makes it clear that after elections or the appointment of new Members, credentials cannot be verified without a full declaration of interests, and that they will not be allowed to take an elected position in Parliament or to be represented on any delegation until they have completed their declaration of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current climate of public opinion we owe it to our electorate and ourselves, not only to operate in a fair and proper manner, but also to allow the people of Europe to see that we do so.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fabre‐Aubrespy </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked to write a report on one very small, very specific point in the amendments put forward today. It involves the existing Rule 8 of our Rules of Procedure, more precisely two of its paragraphs – paragraph 3 and paragraph 5 – governing resignations by Members of this Parliament, which can sometimes pose a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some uncertainty surrounding the date of effect of a resignation as a result of a legally doubtful distinction which is drawn between, on the one hand, the formal conditions governing resignation – first a letter and then notification in an official record – and, on the other, the date of effect of that resignation as stipulated by the existing paragraph 5 of Rule 8. Notification of resignation in an official record was intended to be a condition which must be fulfilled before the resignation can take effect. It is a guarantee for the Member of Parliament and there is no question of changing it.</p>
<p class="contents">But we considered whether we needed to retain the procedure of the resignation letter and the official record, and concluded that the Rules could be simplified by stipulating that notification of the resignation must be made in the form of an official record, as laid down in the existing paragraph 3 and dispensing with the letter of resignation, and that the vacancy will be established as from the date indicated by the resigning Member in that official record. So the ambiguity on this point will be removed if Parliament adopts Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 9, which I believe met with widespread agreement in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to speak on the report as a whole to explain why, on behalf of my group, I am opposed to its adoption. Quite frankly, the report does not properly answer the question that was asked, and it imprudently raises questions that were not asked.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I maintain that this implementation is premature, firstly – and here Professor Duhamel might remember that the parliament of the state he represents consists of two chambers – because in fact the ratification debate is currently still taking place in the French Parliament, and also because, with no date set for the Treaty to come into force, the provisions we are going to adopt will come into force in the next part‐session, which will be before the Treaty has been ratified. But the text also goes beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam. This is the case, in particular, in Amendment No 28 enshrining the practice of interinstitutional agreements, which are legally doubtful. This also applies to Amendments Nos 67 and 68 on the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is also imprudent in introducing issues not included in the mandate given by the Conference of Presidents. This applies to Amendment No 90 which provides that mutually exclusive amendments are inadmissible; this is a very ambiguous provision. It also applies to Amendment No 96 which states that the composition of the committees shall, as far as possible, reflect the composition of the plenary. It also applies to Amendment No 14 on censure of parliamentary office‐holders and to Amendment No 78. I refer Members interested in these issues to the minority opinion where I have set out my reservations.</p>

<p class="contents">Confirmation of the validity of the mandate of elected Members has thereby become more rigorous, as have the conditions governing the termination of the mandate and the full extent of Members' powers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of course a complex field where a plethora of common rules – laid down by the Treaties and by Parliament's Rules of Procedure – and national rules coexist. There are moreover several large ‘grey areas', where the borderline between national and Community competence is not always clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater certainty concerning powers and competences will be achieved once the uniform electoral procedure and the single Members' Statute enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Rules Committee appointed me to draw up a report – which has been incorporated into the report now under discussion, in Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 – on ways of exploiting fully the existing scope under the Treaties to maximise the European Parliament's competence to ensure that the composition of Parliament is and remains as desired by the electorate, and that the exercise of its mandate is not subject to undue impediment.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments propose, firstly, that procedures already followed during this legislature should be written into the Rules of Procedure, for example the obligation to sign declarations of non‐incompatibility and financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wish to enhance Parliament's powers to monitor withdrawals of candidates under national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Parliament is empowered to require the Member States to cooperate fairly and squarely in forwarding all information liable to affect the exercise of the mandate, concerning national electoral legislation or the conferring of a national assignment on an MEP.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 is of particular importance: it enables Parliament to interact with national authorities in procedures which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of these amendments will constitute a further step towards an effective Community‐wide Members' Statute, which is a vital precondition if our institutions are to function properly and the European Parliament's role is to be strengthened.</p>

It involved the necessary clarification of the Rules on expressing minority opinions, and I am delighted that the work schedule has you chairing this sitting, because in a previous legislature we were co‐authors of a minority opinion and we came up against difficulties in applying the Rules as they were then and as, on the whole, they remain.</p>
<p class="contents">What was needed then, and is needed now, is to specify the conditions whereby a minority opinion can appear in the explanatory statement, and the general idea has been to use the technique and model set out in our Rules for the written explanation of vote, setting a precise ceiling on the number of words.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also necessary to decide where the minority opinion should appear. The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee. That is the time when ideas, thoughts and vague hopes are crystallised into a completely identifiable formal opinion. Of course, an arbitration authority is needed in case our work is inadequate and does not cover the range of situations which could arise, and we feel that the chairman of the committee should be able to settle any disputes which might still arise despite this improvement in the Rules. That is the intent of Amendment No 99, which clarifies paragraph 3 of Rule 146.</p>

But that is not really my problem. What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments. I believe that we must ask ourselves whether such a comprehensive amendment of the Rules will really make Parliament more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">The acid test of the democratic culture of a parliament is minority rights. Have they been strengthened or weakened here? I think it is not difficult to see that the countless amendments restrict the rights of the smaller groups, the minorities, that they do not strengthen the rights of the individual Member, that they give precedence to majority rights and to the bureaucratisation of Parliament. I think it is a pity that the majority of Members are using this opportunity to make Parliament less democratic rather than taking substantial steps to make it more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett has described the Commission"s position in relation mainly to future integration and is looking, in the final analysis, to a European government; but I think he must also realise that a European government of this kind would have a particular result for Parliament, as it would split it into an opposition and government parties. That is what makes it so precarious, for it would mean that minority rights were restricted rather than strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many examples of this. Let me name three: the vote of no confidence against senior office holders of this House – no one group even has the right to express no confidence; the number of signatures in support of initiatives is increased from 29 to 32; it will become more difficult to table motions for resolutions. That is the reverse of making Parliament more democratic. It is an attempt by the majorities to win themselves advantages, and I regret this development because it does not benefit the European Parliament, and certainly not its democratic culture.</p>

This is the last rule in our Rules of Procedure and it concerns the annexes. The annexes are not exactly rules, but they are still part of the Rules of Procedure, and with this new Rule 168 we aimed to clarify the structure of the annexes by arranging them under three headings: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ implementing provisions for procedures under these Rules, adopted by simple majority in Parliament; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ provisions adopted in implementation of specific terms of the Rules of Procedure, in particular, for example – as an illustration – Rule 9 on the code of conduct. The code of conduct is adopted by an absolute majority. Provision is also made in our Rules for permanent and temporary committees to be set up by the Conference of Presidents and under Rule 135; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ interinstitutional agreements, and a whole series of procedures with a bearing on Parliament"s operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this subdivision will make the annexes clearer and easier to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final point, Madam President. We are discussing eight reports by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, in association with the Corbett‐Palacio‐Gutiérrez report. This is like clearing out the Rules Committee"s cupboards. I do not think it is a very useful practice, but I suppose it is better than nothing at all.</p>

To me it is obvious that if you are speaking on a subject in which you have a personal interest, you make that fact clear to the House.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will start by complimenting Mr Corbett on all the work he has put in on this extremely complicated subject. The same goes, in different measure, for the two co‐rapporteurs, Mrs Palacio and Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, the latter supposedly expressing the opinion of the smaller groups. I cannot in all honesty say that it was unduly prominent.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can say that with this review, Parliament certainly has come a step closer towards becoming a true parliament but has not yet come of age, and that consequently this general revision has not quite achieved its goal. Why do I say that? Because we still chop up our debates into little snippets, with all nationalities and parties and shades of political opinion speaking individually, rather than having a single spokesmen for all the groups who can make a real and fundamental contribution to the debate. Nor is there a true dialogue with the Council and the Commission in which Parliament says something, the Council or Commission responds and then we have the chance of a second round.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment addressed to Mr Voggenhuber. He is exaggerating, these are not Rules of Procedure for the big groups. All they do is consolidate the current position. Forgive me for exceeding my speaking time. It was due to inattentiveness on the Council"s part.</p>

<p class="contents">Some years ago the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities was asked to extend to intergroups the rules that require individual Members to declare any outside support received. This proved surprisingly tricky, partly because no definition of an intergroup could be agreed, and partly because some groups registered as intergroups with the group chairmen do not receive outside support whereas some other groupings of Members which are not considered to be intergroups receive such support. The amendment therefore speaks in terms of groupings of Members, both intergroups and other unofficial groupings. These will now have to declare any assistance they receive whether in cash or in kind, which would include secretarial assistance, support with research and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Such groupings in the European Parliament often perform a valuable role. There is not a major problem with intergroups in the European Parliament and the current Rules which require Members to declare any significant support they receive would embrace support received via an intergroup as well. However, there are concerns about intergroups and there is clearly a lack of transparency. These rule changes should make everything much more open.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the quaestors are charged with drawing up detailed rules. These should include a requirement that groups receiving outside support must file their minutes and records of attendance with the European Parliament, and that these should be publicly available. That would enable everyone to see who might be influencing whom.</p>

Our suggestions have been both accepted and now explained by the rapporteurs. It is our belief that it is a legitimate prerogative of this Parliament to debate, to suggest and to question actions taken by the Executive in foreign affairs, be that the Commission or the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative will be the key, and it seems to me a matter of great urgency that we hold a confirmation hearing jointly with the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees of the Member State parliaments to examine the mandate and the intentions of the successful candidate, whoever he or she may be, once the High Representative is appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems to me – and we cover this in our draft opinion – that a similar procedure should be available to us on the appointment of special representatives, envoys and EU ambassadors. So, I can endorse these rule changes heartily.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a personal intervention to suggest to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities something it might like to consider in the next Parliament. I detect an insidious growth in the power of the Conference of Presidents over the internal organisation of this Parliament, a growth in power at the expense of the Bureau, of the Conference of Committee Presidents, of the Quaestors and, most importantly, of this plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the opportunity of watching the Conference of Presidents in action. It is consistently overworked and often ill‐briefed. To make the Conference of Presidents the ultimate arbiter of every decision in this Parliament is an abuse and a mistake. I am full of admiration for the leaders of the two big groups, but to adapt the terminology of the World Trade Organization, these are the two great elephants of Parliament. They cannot be experts on everything. They each lead complex coalitions. Their joint voting power in the Conference of Presidents leads to the governance of this House by a ‘condominium of the confused".</p>
<p class="contents">It will be real test of the democratic vigour of this House if it can look its leadership in the eyes, and amend its Rules accordingly in the next mandate.</p>

The revision of the Rules of Procedure focuses on the innovations arising from the Amsterdam Treaty. The Committee on Budgetary Control proposed few amendments, since the Treaty of Amsterdam makes no substantive changes either to the process or the nature of the discharge procedure. It tabled only two amendments. The first concerns institutional responsibility for decisions overruling a withholding of approval by the Financial Controller, which in our view should revert to the President of Parliament. Secondly, we want to clarify that there is no interaction between the consequences of discharge and the procedure whereby Parliament may request the Commission to submit to it any appropriate legislative proposal pursuant to Article 138b of the EC Treaty, on the basis of an own‐initiative report. Unfortunately, neither amendment has been adopted to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile things have progressed, however. The refusal to grant the Commission a discharge last December brought to light a whole range of inconsistencies between the provisions of the Treaty and Annex V of the Rules of Procedure. These inconsistencies must be remedied immediately to ensure the smooth running and completion of the discharge procedure. We can congratulate the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on its zeal and thoroughness in tackling this problem. We await Mr Fayot"s report in the near future, confident that it will clarify this complex subject for us.</p>

With reference to Rule 157(1), second paragraph, of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the guidelines for specialist committees of the European Parliament considering petitions, which have been drawn up by the Conference of Committee Chairmen.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the committee stresses the need to build on the successful cooperation established between the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman and to anchor it sufficiently clearly in the Rules of Procedure. We therefore propose that Annex VI, XX (Powers and responsibilities of standing committees) should be clarified and that relations with the European Ombudsman should be included among the responsibilities of the Committee on Petitions. We further propose that clearer rules on submission of the annual reports and special reports on the activities of the European Ombudsman should be included in Chapter XX, Rule 161 (Activities of the Ombudsman).</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to insert in the Rules of Procedure more precise rules on the submission and consideration of the Ombudsman"s annual reports and special reports by the European Parliament. If in future the Ombudsman were to submit more interim or special reports on very specialised topics, we would advocate that not all of them should necessarily be considered in plenary. Some of the matters covered by such reports could be dealt with more effectively if simpler and more rapid procedures were applied, which might be devised if this were felt appropriate. Corresponding provisions, modelled on Rule 44 or Rule 52, could be inserted in the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would be appropriate for a procedure to be introduced in the Rules of Procedure for urgent consideration of the Ombudsman"s reports by Parliament, especially with regard to their placing on the part‐session agenda. I thank the rapporteurs and hope our amendments will be adopted.</p>

The committee proposes that the vote on approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole shall be taken by roll call. That is a grave mistake. Behind rules there are thoughts, ideas, concepts, aims, strategies. What were the Heads of State and Government thinking when they wrote into the Treaties that the vote on a motion of censure shall be by roll call? The thought behind that is obvious. Roll‐call votes split Parliament into national delegations and political groups. This puts Parliament under pressure and therefore makes it subject to control. That is the point of a roll‐call vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are introducing it for approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole. And that means that we too are exposing ourselves to pressure and can therefore be controlled. That is the result! Parliament would be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot. In fact the Commission would also be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot. This vote on approval would not give the impression of being a forced vote. That is why I regard this as a grave mistake. I cannot imagine that Members really want it.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my appeal to support the amendments calling for a vote by secret ballot.</p>

My group has nevertheless tabled a number of amendments – Amendment No 125 and the subsequent amendments – most of which are technical. We trust that these amendments will therefore gain the necessary support within the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to the remarks made by Mr Rothley on behalf of the Socialist Group. As ever, his remarks were pertinent and largely justified. It can nevertheless also be argued that a vote as important as the one to approve the nomination of the President of the European Commission must display visible symbols of its significance, and voting by roll call has traditionally always served that purpose. Notwithstanding this, we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European People"s Party, I should like to highlight a number of points on which either the group cannot agree with the Committee on the Rules of Procedure or where it has tabled political rather than technical amendments to clarify the issue. Referring again to the three categories of amendments, and more specifically to the political ones, our group is opposed to the so‐called ‘internal censure motion" provided for in Amendment No 14. In our view, it achieves nothing and would result in more complications than advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 124 by the Socialist Group concerning interparliamentary delegations raises serious legal problems. The delegations are, after all, bodies with power vested in them by the House, and it is inconceivable that their membership should fall into two categories – primary members from the Bureau, elected by the House, and secondary members, appointed by the Conference of Presidents. The Group of the European People"s Party understands the logic behind this amendment, but feels that the democratic principles which must provide the foundations for the composition of each and every one of Parliament"s bodies should also be respected as far as these interparliamentary delegations are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the appointment of the High Representative, we have tabled Amendment No 129, which provides further detail and is more in line with the Treaty than the amendment tabled by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the legislative amendments, the Group of the European People"s Party is totally opposed to the amendment to Rule 53 concerning the legal basis and is therefore also opposed to Amendment No 38.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the third group of amendments on the indirect consequences of having gained the status of colegislators, and as regards time, improved management of resources, translations, the introduction of new technology and so on, the Group of the European People"s Party tabled Amendment No 144 which clarifies the situation concerning explanatory statements and makes it more manageable. A large majority opposes the exclusion amendments to Rule 90 and the one‐minute speeches in Rule 78.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a word about the implementation of this revision. As Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy has rightly said, we must be aware that implementation must await the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Before Thursday, therefore, an oral amendment or technical amendment needs to be introduced to take account of this situation. On behalf of the European People"s Party, I propose that all the amendments should come into effect at the first part‐session following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>

As you are aware, where there is uncertainty as to the correct legal basis, every committee of Parliament has so far had to seek the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee. Amendment No 38 is now proposing that, in the event of a dispute, this requirement to seek an opinion should be replaced by a requirement merely to inform the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights. That is a very dangerous development in the wrong direction. If every committee can determine the legal basis individually, this will lead to still more conflicts of responsibility between the committees and it will be very hard to see any consistency in the basis or Treaty article which the European Parliament uses in its decision making. My group has therefore retabled Amendment No 138 to the effect that in the event of disagreement over the legal basis, the Legal Affairs Committee must be consulted, not informed. Arguments against this on grounds of the supposed unnecessary delay are overcome by an urgency procedure which is appended to the amendment. I would commend this amendment to the House.</p>

There are, however, some rather radical proposals of a political nature which would give the European Parliament more power than is actually provided for in the text of the Treaty. In that category belong, for example, Amendment No 60 on the agreement between the labour market partners, Amendment No 69 on the Council's foreign policy representative and Amendment No 16 relating to the President of the Commission. It is totally unacceptable to attempt to overstep the clear boundaries set in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains other proposals that are equally unacceptable. This applies particularly to Amendment No 90, which states that groups may not table mutually exclusive amendments. I think there are many people in the House who regard censorship of this type as undesirable. We all know that different viewpoints can be accommodated within the various political groups. I therefore hope this proposal will not succeed for one reason or another.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we should have used this opportunity to establish that the President of Parliament should be elected for five years, so that we can be spared the extraordinary procedure whereby the two large groups end up sharing the office between them.</p>

<p class="contents">As has already been highlighted by other speakers within this Parliament, there are a number of contradictions and elements within this combined report which will cause us difficulties in the future. I would specifically like to draw Members' attention to the question of whether we elect the President of the Commission or whether we approve the nomination of the President of the Commission. Likewise, this proposal that the Conference of Presidents acting by three‐fifths majority, representing at least three groups, may propose to the plenary – acting by absolute majority – to terminate any elected office holder's position within this Parliament. I think it is ridiculous that somebody who is elected by the body of the Parliament – by the individual Members here within the Parliament – can have their office terminated by a decision of the Conference of Presidents. I have no difficulty if three‐fifths or three‐sixths or three‐sevenths of the Parliament decide to terminate such offices, but if the Conference of Presidents does so it is absolutely crazy. Likewise, the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament. We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that my group's amendment with regard to the numbers required for the formulation of groups has been accepted and I also hope that Members will vote for the one‐minute speech at the start of the first sitting of each part‐session which gives us the opportunity to raise issues of importance in our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to ensure that our new Rules of Procedure are unambiguous, direct, and able to deal with the actual powers that we have and not try to create new ones. Most importantly, it must be remembered that the dignity of the Members of this House and their rights as elected representatives of the people of Europe must be foremost in any formulation of our rules.</p>

Many of the amendments were eliminated in committee, but a few that worry me remain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned about one point. It is particularly important that the European Parliament, which has rightly dedicated itself to the protection of minorities, does not lose sight of this aim in its dealings with the minorities in its own House. The proposals to amend the provisions on the formation of groups, and also the horizontal increase in the number of required signatures from 29 to 32, unjustifiably weaken the small groupings whose importance to the diversity of opinion inherent in a democracy has indeed recently become more than apparent.</p>

Mrs Bjerregaard is Denmark's representative and a new majority in the Danish Parliament can send a new representative next time. So ultimately our voters are the ones who have the final say and indirectly appoint the Danish Member of the Commission. The Amsterdam Treaty gives Parliament the right to approve nominations by the Member States, and this is a power which is now to be written into the Rules of Procedure. But now Parliament is saying instead that it should elect or reject the Commission. The Commission is no longer to be a result of the decisions of the Member States alone, but in effect a common government of the EU. The Commission is to be elected by Parliament in almost the same way as a national parliament elects a government. That is a recipe for a federal state with a common parliament and a common government. Parliament expects to be able to reject the names which are put forward by the Member States when they are not in line with the views of the majority. In reality, Parliament wants to transfer the power to appoint the Commission from the national parliaments and governments to this supranational assembly. That is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal. Parliament cannot simply take power from the Member States on its own authority. The June Movement is therefore voting against the new Rules of Procedure, and we call upon the Member States to protest against Parliament's attempt to transform the national parliaments into a kind of junior branch of local government.</p>

I agree with 99 % of what they have produced; however, there are two points on which our views diverge.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only. I simply cannot find a logical reason for such a proposal. It is justified on the grounds that the larger countries should not be given an advantage, which is illogical and untenable in itself since the larger countries always have an advantage, for instance when it comes to having to collect 29 signatures in order to table an amendment. The only logical reason I have been able to find for such a change is political, in other words the rapporteurs would like to make it impossible to form national groups so as to tone down national differences in the House, thereby giving it a more European character. This is a commendable objective, but the Rules of Procedure are no place for political aims. The Rules of Procedure should be politically neutral. For that reason, I am going to vote against this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The other amendment which in my view is unnecessary states that a political group cannot table amendments that are mutually exclusive. It is already difficult enough to table amendments in this House. Such a change would only add to the difficulties. I do not think we should set about making Parliament less democratic in this way. Furthermore, the gains in efficiency that would result from such a change are negligible. At most, only a tiny fraction of all the votes are mutually exclusive. Consequently, I am going to vote against these two proposals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Manzella </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Madam President, the valuable work done by our three rapporteurs confirms, yet again, the need for the exercise of MEPs' constitutional duties to be autonomously regulated. Consequently, this House is lending an initial interpretation to the Amsterdam Treaty – assuming that it does enter into force – even before the establishment of the relevant judicial and extra‐parliamentary practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must devote particular attention here to the regulatory nature of the new legislative procedures, since in its next term, Parliament is certain to enjoy equal status with the Council in a twin‐chamber legislative system. More specifically, according to this blueprint, the new codecision procedure is in line both with the resolution adopted by Parliament on this matter and with the joint interinstitutional agreement that is soon to be approved. I must however endorse the requested addition to Rule 66, recognising the Commission's role in so‐called informal conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's monopoly over legislative initiative is undoubtedly an anomaly within the Community system; but it is a welcome anomaly, considering the meagre legislative output of many national parliaments. The Commission's role of counterbalancing the two legislative bodies is in itself an element of regulatory coherence and consistency, with its constant emphasis on the rationale behind proposed legislation. But this role must be performed throughout the legislative process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fayot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the European Parliament is a young parliament. This is a fundamental difference between it and the national parliaments, some of which have been sitting for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years is barely an anniversary, not quite the age of reason. So our Rules, which are the charter of our parliamentary life, are particularly important. For democracy to work despite all our differences, the letter as well as the spirit of the Rules must be observed. They cannot be bent to the dictates of the political climate. Their reliability depends on consistency in their daily interpretation and application. That is also why the Rules need to evolve. Above all they must be amended to make the procedures simpler and less burdensome so that they are faster and more effective. We must not allow them to be used politically to block a parliamentary institution whose role is to take legislative decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Parliament where five‐year government majorities do not exist, but where majorities change with the issues, simple and transparent procedures are essential for the public to understand what we do. So I cannot accept Mr Voggenhuber"s complaint that this change in the Rules means less democracy. I think a balance has been struck between democracy and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last remark, Mr President, following what Mr Spencer has just said in the debate. It has been suggested that when we restructure the committees in the next parliamentary term, we should remove the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities by merging it with another committee. I would regret such a merger. Personally I think it would be better to create a proper constitutional committee in the European Parliament to deal with all aspects of the working life of Parliament. I think it is important to oil the wheels of our procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Rules Committee may I make one last comment on the controversial issue of entry into force. I think, and the three rapporteurs agree with me, that this package of amendments to the Rules should come into force at the same time as the Treaty of Amsterdam. There are two series of provisions here, some adapting the Rules to the Treaty of Amsterdam, others independent of the Treaty. So for reasons of simplicity, Mr President, I think the best course is to bring the changes into force at the same time as the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission is aware that first and foremost, Parliament"s Rules of Procedure concern this House and its independent internal organisation. Nevertheless, in the light of the Commission"s role in the legislative process, it does have a legitimate interest in the Rules as they do affect us to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by offering my sincere congratulations to the three rapporteurs. Thanks to their work, Parliament will be equipped with new Rules which take into account the significant changes introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, particularly where the legislative procedure is concerned. These new Rules will be ready to be implemented as soon as the Treaty comes into force. I should also like to highlight the efforts made by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to clarify rules and simplify procedures without overlooking the importance of reaching agreement amongst the various groups. In addition, I appreciate Parliament"s legitimate desire to take advantage of the fresh opportunities offered in the Treaty of Amsterdam and to enshrine them in the new text. Parliament had already expressed this wish on the occasion of the Single Act and again at the time of the Treaty on European Union. I agreed with Mr Corbett"s image of a piece of elastic you can stretch or let go of and which needs to be tight enough but not so tight that it snaps.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall single out certain features of the new Rules which merit special consideration. Firstly, we are somewhat concerned with the new arrangements to review the Commission"s proposals in relation to human rights and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. In our view, the proposal is somewhat vague as it states only that if Parliament considers that a Commission proposal does not respect one or other of these principles it shall ask the Commission to make the necessary adjustments. Does this therefore mean that a special reading will be devoted to these matters or will they be given particular consideration at first reading? If the first option were to be applied, the procedure could slow down the entire legislative process and might even contradict the Interinstitutional Agreement on subsidiarity. The need to safeguard the Commission"s right of initiative should not be overlooked either. I am confident that neither Mr Corbett nor the other rapporteurs are doing so, as they are very much aware that this is a key component of the entire institutional system. The same is true of the proposals relating to the consideration of the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the new conciliation procedure provided for by the new Rule 66(5) at second reading with the relevant parliamentary committee could be most useful. We are convinced that greater dialogue between Parliament and the Commission is desirable and may prove effective. Nevertheless, we feel that in line with the spirit of the new joint declaration on codecision which is shortly to be approved, this should feature in each and every one of the stages concerned. Whatever the formula eventually approved, this dialogue should become an integral part of the actual process. Consequently, we feel that the amendment tabled by Mrs Palacio which provides for the Commission"s presence is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as comitology is concerned, you will be aware that we are engaged in interinstitutional contacts in the hope of reaching a solution. We therefore feel that it would be premature to formalise arrangements concerning comitology in the Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Rule 90d introduces a procedure similar to the so‐called ‘advice and consent" procedure used in the United States Senate. In this case, however, it would be invoked to appoint the heads of Commission delegations to third countries. In my view, a distinction should be made between the appointment of civil servants and essentially political appointments made in accordance with the Treaties and involving hearings in the House. Here, I am referring to the appointment of Commissioners, members of the Court of Auditors, directors of the European Central Bank and the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy. In our view, it is not appropriate to hold hearings on the appointment of officials as this falls within the Commission"s competence and is essentially the Commission"s responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to inform the rapporteurs that we are happier with the final version of Rule 107(9) on speaking time. This states that the amount of time allocated to the Commission has to be agreed with the Commission and must in any case be without prejudice to the provisions of Article 197 of the Treaty, according to which the Commission is entitled to put forward its view at any time. We are prepared to cooperate with the efforts to plan and simplify debates but we must insist on our rights under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in connection with Mr Corbett"s remarks concerning the Commission, I should like to inform both him and the House as a whole that the Commission is quite prepared to strengthen its political relationship with the European Parliament. A closer relationship between the two institutions must take account of their specific roles. The Commission"s role is to initiate and execute, and Parliament"s role is to monitor. This strengthened relationship must be an essential component of the Union"s institutional structure, and should benefit, in particular, transparency and legislative issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the House on its initiative to move ahead with the revision of the Rules of Procedure before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. I am confident that in future we shall have an effective instrument at our disposal which we can use to continue and strengthen our interinstitutional cooperation.</p>
