This success is not purely coincidental. It is the fruit of a major policy decision that favours solidarity, a decision that has resulted, in budgetary terms, in the appropriation of more than a third of Community expenditure for economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">During this 2000-2006 programming period, the Commission adopted, on 31 January, the second report on economic and social cohesion in accordance with Article 159, subparagraph 2, of the Treaty. In addition to being a pertinent account of the studies carried out and the statistical information gathered in the field of enlargement, the report contains conclusions and recommendations that should encourage debate on the future of regional policy. Economic and social cohesion is a real issue that we should be concerned with from now on, for we have to provide answers for the next programming period starting 1 January 2007, a time when enlargement to include new Member States will be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the statistical information in the second report on cohesion, one fact stands out in our minds: enlargement will bring a challenge twice as large as the one we are currently facing, for the figures indicate that regional disparities are set to double. In relative terms, regions that are lagging behind in their development and those which are having problems with restructuring will be greater in number and this effect will be multiplied when we are 27 Member States. In addition, due to a simple mechanical reality, a certain number of regions in the current European Union will no longer find themselves on the list of problem regions although their true economic situation has not really improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our attention needs to be focused on two crucial questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is whether enlargement is conceivable without a powerful structure and cohesion policy. The second question is how the policy on economic and social cohesion should in future continue to focus on regions that lag behind current Member States developmentally, and what are the objectives that need to be met. Both questions were extensively dealt with during the informal Regional Policy Council which was held recently in Namur on 13 July last.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first question, everyone has accepted that enlargement will bring with it a substantial increase in needs in terms of social and economic cohesion. That was also clearly underlined in the Commission’s second report on economic and social cohesion. The figures in the report speak for themselves. Following on enlargement, discrepancies will become more pronounced in two ways. Firstly, the section of the population in regions with a Gross Domestic Product per capita that is less than 75% of the current EU average will double, and that means that the number of inhabitants that fall within the scope of present objective 1 of the Structural Funds will increase from 19% in the EU of Fifteen Members to 36% in an EU comprising twenty-seven Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, discrepancies will increase in extent. Today’s average Gross Domestic Product per capita in the underprivileged regions stands at 66% of the EU average. If one adds to this the less developed regions of the candidate countries, the average Gross Domestic Product per capita drops back to less than half of the EU average, to only 77% to be precise.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the above data, one can conclude that with enlargement, the cohesion problem doubles in terms of its original scope and its original extent. Poverty and inequality are persistent problems and we realise that we will need to fight them for a long time yet to come. Even if the candidate countries were to grow faster than the amalgamated countries have done in the past ten years, even then, the current level of the Gross Domestic Product per capita would imply a convergence process spanning at least two generations. Even with the Irish rate of growth of the past ten years, it would take twenty years to reach 90% of the Gross Domestic Product per capita of the fifteen EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from that perspective that today’s priorities and objectives of our regional policy must be viewed. Even the management itself of the outlined package of measures is an important element, in the sense that we should not overlook the fact that at present, most candidate countries do not have appropriate structures in place to manage properly the regional policy in the way we in most cases propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, during the informal Council in Namur, we were given a clear signal that it is necessary to continue to support the current underprivileged regions in the European Union. The present objectives pertaining to the underprivileged regions, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries, must be supported in a fair manner. That will inevitably need to go hand in hand with an even more efficient deployment of Community resources.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore unanimity as regards the continuation of the present regional policy concerning those regions which continue to face structural difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the coherence of the actions to be taken, the Fifteen support a strengthening of this coherence at all levels, particularly between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with a more specific focus being given to interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, requests for additional assessments, particularly on the efficiency of the current system, have been drawn up by certain Member States before they are prepared to advance further in the determination of procedures and mechanisms that will govern the future of economic and social cohesion policy. These procedures and mechanisms will be the subject of a global proposal from the Commission in 2004, in its third report on economic and social cohesion. In any case, it is clear that projects and action supported by the economic and social cohesion policy are particularly important to European citizens. This contributes to the process of bringing citizens closer to European institutions and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, by publishing the second report on economic and social cohesion, has paved the way for an important debate on the future of the European Union’s structural operations policy. The Council, during the informal meeting on regional policy that took place in Namur, listened very carefully to the presentation made by Commissioner Barnier. The Council then debated the issue in a calm atmosphere where everybody had the chance to speak and be heard. The discussions focused on questions of substance, in a climate that was generally positive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no definitive option has yet been decided on. To do this, the questions asked in the second report need to be looked at in much greater detail. The Commission will continue its analysis and will encourage debate by organising working parties for each issue. The results of this will be used in the drafting of a third report, expected in 2004. At this point, it will be sent back to the Council and Parliament, on the basis of the Commission’s proposals, to be used at an earlier stage in the development of the future framework of cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I can personally bring you up to date, as I am sure you were hoping I would, on the great debate we started on 31 January in this very place, when I came to present you with the second report on economic and social cohesion that the Commission had just approved. On that occasion we, in addition to this presentation, started a debate that I said, and I am anxious to repeat on this very occasion, would be sincere, objective, without any issue being taboo, on one of the great Community policies at the very heart of the perception that we have of our European Union, for it relates to the policy of solidarity. Since 31 January, the debate has been stoked by new contributions. I am thinking in particular of the Cohesion Forum of 21 and 22 May, organised right here thanks to the European Parliament, in agreement with your President and with the support of my colleagues Anna Diamantopoulou and Franz Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, enlargement negotiations are progressing with all candidate countries. Enlargement, as you know, is one of the main themes of this debate. I would like to reiterate now that we must make a clear distinction between accession negotiations, which are based on the application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in new Member States, and the reform of structural policies for the period following 2006. The debate that I am inviting you to participate in mainly focuses on the period after 2006. We are, of course, not calling into question what current Member States receive from the Structural Funds from now until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Parliament, in requesting the Commission to give its opinion, wanted to take stock of this debate. I would like to thank you, therefore, for this opportunity and thus quickly mention certain points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the forum we held on 21 and 22 May was an opportunity for genuine debate, paving the way for other such moments. Since 31 January, the presentation of conclusions from the cohesion report has been, for both myself and my colleagues from the Directorate-General on Regional Policy, a priority. You can be sure that I will fully participate in this debate, week after week, at ground level. Last Friday in Helsinki, for example, I met the twenty Finnish regional Presidents. Tomorrow and the day after, in Oporto, I will attend an assembly of the conference of peripheral maritime regions, where we will discuss this future cohesion policy. In this way, the debate should spread, should move away from the political centre in such a way that it provides firstly the Member States and then Brussels with a certain number of ideas, requests, proof and guidelines. The 21 May forum was a very important moment for me and one that taught many lessons. It brought together a number of ministers, several former prime ministers, current prime ministers, representatives from regions and towns, not only from the fifteen Member States but also from the candidate countries, and many very high-level contributions. I would like to bring to light three aspects of these contributions and the discussion that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck mentioned earlier, that I held in Namur with the fifteen ministers in charge of regional policy, on the invitation of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the interest the future of this policy after 2006 arouses in all Member States and candidate countries, and the insistence of many on the truly political dimension of European solidarity. This is not solely a question of money. It is also the expression, as you very clearly stated, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Presidency, of possibly the most concrete, the most precise and visible of the values upon which the European Union is founded. The proof that our Union is not just a large free trade area or single market, but also a community of solidarity that should one day be a political force.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have had no negative feedback regarding the enlargement process. There is concern, of course, but also a sense of the European Union’s historic obligation and interest in both new and old Member States in assisting in the long-lasting and balanced development of the whole European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I have also measured the importance, in order for this debate to succeed, of not forgetting the needs of regions in States that are current members of the EU. I would like once again to state my conviction: we are not of the opinion that by admitting very poor regions in Eastern Europe – Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria and others – into the European Union, that regions that are poor or that are experiencing difficulties in the north, the centre, the south, not to mention the outermost regions, will become rich as if by waving a magic wand. After enlargement there will be problems and needs in the EU as it currently stands.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, here we have what constitutes, when all is considered, strong encouragement for the maintenance of a cohesion policy that is suited to the new economic challenges and future geography of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns procedures for the future. As you know, the Commission has committed itself, following requests from the Council in June, to provide it with a regular report on the development of its work on future cohesion policy. This information, which I must give to the Council, I must also, naturally, give to the European Parliament. I will propose to the Commission that it adopt the first of these regular interim reports at the very beginning of next year, in January, as soon as we have new statistics available. These statistics will explain, update and clarify the information that is already available in the cohesion report. I would like to point out that these new statistics, supplied by Eurostat, will involve, for example, the GDP per capita in 1999, and unemployment statistics for the year 2000. Therefore, the more up-to-date these figures are, the more serious and objective the debate will be. This interim report for the month of January will therefore contain an update of figures and analyses from the first part of the cohesion report devoted to the situation of regions, but it will also present the results of different studies that we have commissioned, as well as lessons learned from the great debates and seminars that have been organised. I can give more details regarding the additional studies commissioned: we have commissioned a study of the situation of the islands, as well as a study on the macroeconomic impact of Structural Funds. With regard to this macroeconomic study, I shall be very eager to provide you with information on the impact of these Structural Funds in terms of the direct impact of the use of these funds in net contributing countries. I also plan to commission an additional study on the situation of mountainous regions or regions that have long-term natural handicaps. In order to stimulate this debate, seminars will be organised during the first half of 2002 on each of the ten Community priorities that have been identified in the cohesion report, with the participation of experts from the Member States and regions who we shall invite in accordance with the various issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point involves, whilst still talking about the future, the basis of the debate. On the subject of the basis of the debate, I would like to express, or state once more, three convictions. My first conviction is that within the coming context of this EU enlargement, the Member States and regions will feel the need for more Community cohesion policy and not less. I do not think that a form of unravelling or renationalisation of regional policy should be the way to respond to this requirement, to this need for cohesion in an enlarged EU where there will be – and the figures speak for themselves – more disparities than today. But I am equally resolutely in favour, while reaffirming this need for cohesion and planning these new cohesion and regional policies, to find, with your help, a way to achieve more decentralisation, simplification, and less bureaucracy. As far as we can, I will, using current European procedures, be anxious to search for and propose all means of moving further towards simplification and decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second conviction is financial in nature. Even if the financial debate is, strictly speaking, premature today, I am not the only one to consider, as I already said here in a personal capacity, that a financial effort that would globally represent any less than 0.45 % of EU GDP would, in my view, call into question the credibility of the future cohesion policy. I think therefore that I can state once more that, in my opinion, we cannot, without calling into question the credibility of this cohesion policy, fall below this threshold of 0.45 % which is a threshold universally accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">My third conviction is that future cohesion policy should be fair and non-discriminatory. It should, therefore, be directed towards all regions that have structural difficulties of whatever nature and deal with questions in a heterogeneous fashion, that is to say, regions that are very backward in terms of development, that happen to be mostly in candidate countries, as well as regions within the current Fifteen that have not truly succeeded in the process of true convergence and for which it would be a good idea, at an opportune moment, to find some means of fair treatment, so that they are not penalised by a purely statistical or mechanical effect linked to a threshold or to new methods applied within the framework of the enlarged EU, in order to deal with the problems of certain areas which have particular handicaps or certain worrying social issues such as equal opportunities or the situation of urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the report we shall put forward at the beginning of next year will take its inspiration from the results of the great debates held in the second half of this year. This is just the first of the meetings I have proposed to hold with you. There will be others before I present you with the third cohesion report in 2004. It is in this frame of mind that I shall be entirely available today and in the forthcoming weeks to listen to your suggestions, your recommendations and your criticisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all events, given that many of the Members are interested in this particular subject and given that regional policy accounts yet again for 35% of the budget, this confirms, I think, just how important it is to the European Union and, in this sense, there is perhaps some point to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to make is that perhaps it would be a good idea at some point – and this is certainly the intention of the Committee on Regional Policy – to discuss the state of progress of projects and programmes under the Community Support Framework in individual countries, because I personally am not at all convinced that everything is going swimmingly in every country, not through any fault of the Commission's, but through the fault of certain Member States. I do not wish to speak of dramatic delays but I am sure that certain countries are having problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the future of cohesion policy is concerned, a debate was started following the second cohesion report by the European Commission and I think that certain conclusions are already obvious, that is, that far more regions will need to be covered, that in regions in the Member States which are already covered there will appear to be an artificial increase in GNP, which does not mean that they will automatically become rich, as the Commissioner has said, and that it goes without saying that more appropriations are needed but that it does not go without saying that it will be easy to find these appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I can see, the conclusions are more or less obvious. First, we must not leave things in the lap of the Gods, we must not take decisions at the eleventh hour, because we could bring the European Union to what may well be an explosive situation. Secondly, we need to concentrate from 2006 onwards on those in real need. Thirdly, we must not create shock waves in regions which stop being covered, because that will give rise to euro-scepticism in these regions. Having said which, I have two unpleasant things to say, one of which is unpleasant for the poorer countries and the other of which is unpleasant for the richer countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For the poorer countries, I think that we need to find ways of making the most of appropriations by introducing suitable mechanisms, incentives and, if necessary, sanctions so that the money actually goes somewhere. And for the richer countries, we need to rethink the overall logic of the Community budget so as to find a way of increasing appropriations, because there will be a huge increase in requirements and regional policy will, as the Commissioner has said, have no credibility whatsoever if we fall below a certain point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, whilst I am grateful for the Commissioner's statement today, my group is still disappointed with the Commission as it appears that it has not used its right of initiative and has not engaged itself fully on this topic. It raises the question as to what the real proposals of the Commission are.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier referred to the meeting in May in which many Members participated, but again nothing concrete seems to have come out of that meeting. On our side of the political divide, we recognised at an early stage how sensitive this issue could be and indeed our experience of Agenda 2000 was the catalyst that told us this. But then Commissioner Wulf-Matthies facilitated a common position with Parliament and so we feel that the time is now right for us to start work with the Commission as it becomes more active, positive and decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has discussed in detail the questions that you have posed. The main points emanating from our discussion revolve around the principle of keeping the concept of social and economic cohesion and its most representative instrument, namely the Cohesion Fund. But a thorough discussion is required on implementing the goals of the cohesion policy before we make any decisions on the future financing of structural aid.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we are facing a number of great challenges and any discussion on the implementation of Cohesion Fund has to include other areas under the umbrella of sustainable development, such as employment and agriculture. We must continue to ensure that the poorer regions that presently receive structural aid are not mistreated in the future and that Community initiatives, such INTERREG and URBAN, are retained. We also question whether 1.27% of the Community GDP, as was decided on in Agenda 2000, is enough with regard to the new Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In launching this debate, it is our view that our discussions would have been more fruitful and more meaningful if the Commission had come forward with ideas of its own so that it could act as a facilitator of those discussions. We know that it is an important issue. At the moment, we are left with a series of questionnaires, but we can give the Commissioner a guarantee that our group will be fully involved in discussions in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank the Commission for its willingness to share this debate with Parliament and, at the same time, for the visits undertaken to Member States. They are very necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is not just how regional policy can be made to work effectively both in the present Member States and in the countries that have applied for membership but also the continuation of structural policy in the present Member States in the next Structural Funds period. Structural Funds policy is currently managed in too cumbersome a manner. Now is a good time to consider, for example, how we might learn from the delay in the preparatory procedures for programmes for the next period. How can we become more effective, achieve better results and reduce bureaucracy? In this connection I would also like to enquire what the Commission’s position is regarding what enlargement means for the overall funding of structural policy. Is the Commission prepared to increase structural policy appropriations during the next Structural Funds period should the situation regarding European economic and social cohesion so demand?</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I would also like to communicate to the Commission that a funding model for enlargement is not acceptable where those having to pay would be the poor regions of the existing EU countries, where there are still lasting problems owing to difficult natural conditions, long distances or sparse populations. The EU must also show solidarity in the future so that new money with a new financial instrument can be found for the new challenges of structural policy, where those that pay would include those central regions that will be the first to benefit economically from enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, cohesion policy will be the litmus test of whether stability can successfully be maintained in an EU of 27 Member States and, moreover, in all its parts. The tendency has, however, prevailed in the Member States not to assess the success of cohesion policy in the less favoured areas, but rather to evaluate success in terms of how much they end up getting for themselves out of each negotiation. Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards! Stability and the successful development of an enlarged Union will be guaranteed after 2006 only if common objective criteria rather than the protection of possession constitute the precondition for the allocation of funds. This means that a new, common cohesion policy must be tested in its entirety against the old policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report on cohesion contains some good proposals, but it perpetuates many of the cohesion policy's errors and is no radical programme of reform. I will say a bit more about the proposals. I think it right and proper that all regions of the enlarged Union should be assessed on an equal basis provided there is no simultaneous impact on regions which are currently being supported. So I wholeheartedly support the principle of phasing out. Increased decentralisation and the promotion of partnership must, however, apply also to the acceding countries in the accession funds – and right now – so that their authorities get some practical experience of them. Phasing-in the acceding countries into a decentralised structural policy as early as 2002 is also necessary in order to pool experience. Even in half measures, an integrated regional policy is the only thing in which donors, too, can have confidence. Quality must therefore come before quantity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, on further analysis of the way structural policy has worked to date, it has to be said that it has a lot of inadequacies.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: The divergence between Member States may well have decreased, but the differences within them – between highly-developed regions and weak ones – have increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: The unemployment rate in the weak regions has not significantly decreased.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: The average per capita income of the wealthiest regions, which make up 10% of the Union's population, is still 2.6 times higher than in the regions in which 10% of the poorest inhabitants live.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: The underdeveloped regions still do not possess self-supporting economic and social cycles. They therefore have enormous problems when it comes to actually reducing the amount by which they lag behind the developed areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly: You yourselves can see that the commitment appropriations yet to be settled totalled almost EUR 42 billion at the end of 1999, in other words the Structural Fund's input for specific projects is inefficient! This means that other measures, even other projects, must be deliberately chosen, something which can, of course, only be done in collaboration with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the shortcomings, the enormous amount of change cannot be overlooked. Differences would otherwise be markedly greater. This also means that we must carry on with the Structural Fund policy. You have just said, Mr Barnier, that there must be no taboos. Too true! All the Member States said more or less the same thing at the informal meeting in Namur, and proposals were submitted. But sooner or later, we must get to the point. At some juncture, it will have to be said that these proposals cost X amount of money, and we must either make it available or we have to admit that we are not going to.</p>
<p class="contents">This cannot be put off for ever and a day. You will be aware that the upper limit equals 1.27% of GDP within the financial perspective for 2000 to 2006. Where are we in real terms? At 1.06%. You can hardly call that putting real structural policy into practice! It is also because of Parliament...</p>

<p class="contents">No, I am not only accusing the Commissioner; we put up with this sort of thing all the time! Not my Group, though; we have always submitted the relevant amendments. Perhaps, Mr Jarzembowski, the PPE-DE Group would like to join in next time, then we should almost make up a majority! In the context of this discussion, we must also of course bear in mind that there are very special regions. I regret to have to say, Commissioner, that the border regions programme imposed by the Commission is utterly inadequate! Perhaps we will have to give some thought to doing something similar...</p>

The cohesion countries have substantially caught up over the past few years and they all participate in EMU. I would therefore observe that this objective of the Cohesion Fund has been attained. Despite this, Agenda 2000 decided that the Cohesion Fund should continue. Would it not have been consistent to let the Cohesion Fund expire, not abruptly perhaps but by its being phased out? The eastward enlargement means that the EU's present cohesion policy cannot be continued with any longer. We all know that eastward enlargement will not be for free, and this must be said frankly. Apart from that, I too believe that much is going wrong with our cohesion policy as regards efficiency, administrative costs and this policy's vulnerability to deception. What the cohesion policy needs is a fundamental debate about its strengths and weaknesses, that is, about its possible reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a difficult debate, being about our patrimony. But it is also about a quite fundamental question: what, in the EU, does solidarity mean? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe that there is actually anybody in this House who is opposed to a cohesion policy. The question we must ask ourselves is whether a cohesion policy would not be better conducted without a Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problems, the first being that, if the accessions were to take place, then, logically, all the acceding States, being the poorest countries and States, would have to join the Cohesion Fund. You cannot say that there is a regional policy for all, a Cohesion Fund for four countries and all the rest can fit in somewhere else! No, so if the Cohesion Fund were to be maintained, it would have to apply to all the acceding countries. It is my personal view, however, that cohesion policy can be carried on better through the medium of general regional and structural policy and without a Cohesion Fund, as the Cohesion Fund seems to me to suffer from the drawback that it turns its attention to States rather than to regions. It is not the States that we want to support, however, but disadvantaged regions. It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I believe this issue should again be considered very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, secondly, that we too should, as you have always said, distinguish between substantial reforms and the question of how much money we want to end up spending on them. We must, in my view, come to a quick decision about the substance, as the acceding States have a right to be told before 2002/2003 what the cohesion policy situation is going to be if they are Members by then.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am not sure that I understood you right: I find your model good in itself. You are saying that there are standard criteria for all regions – one or two, shall we say – then there is phasing out for the regions that used to be supported but no longer can be because of the new criteria or simply because there is no more money. The question now arises: by what criteria should support actually be given in future? I myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two, or even three, criteria. I have, though, the slight suspicion – which you hinted at earlier – that there will subsequently be ten. So one takes a look to see what criterion fits the region. Oh look, there are a few mountains, so this is a mountain region. And this place has island status, so we shall call it an island region!</p>
<p class="contents">I think it better to take any old percentage – GDP plus, perhaps, the unemployment situation, for example. If one takes that a step further and says that the balance of the sexes or the standard of education of men and women are to be counted as general criteria, then – if I may say so – things get a bit jumbled. So please let us carry on our discussions, as you said you would. We are on your side and look forward to continuing the debate with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to say frankly that, in my considered opinion, nobody must close his eyes to the fact that enlargement is going to present us all with great challenges, those of a financial nature among them. The Germans learned their lesson through reunification, when the citizens were told at first that it would involve no fiscal burdens for them. This was demonstrably false. Let there be no misunderstandings – of course we want enlargement. But we must squarely face the consequences for structural policy. We should not simply be told ‘as you were’, and I do not believe that we will be.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are not to forfeit the trust of people in the affected regions, we must point this out clearly, honestly and at an early stage. If there is not to be a rude awakening, we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and, at the same time, concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average. The success of this will depend on making certain changes which would have been required even without enlargement. First, there is the fact that the cohesion countries can point to very variable results from the catching-up process, and it is evident that the greatest successes were achieved where the actors were on the spot and shared a commitment to maximising the efficiency of the support.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, project evaluation needs further improvement and efficient management needs greater rewards than in the past if the effectiveness of the means employed is to be assessed. Last but not least, there is no getting away from the need for closer dovetailing with the other EU policies, in particular the common agricultural policy. I believe that both targets can be reached through the decentralisation and simplification that Mr Barnier has mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of the analysis contained in these two reports, I would like to refer to three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is obvious: the cohesion policy comes within European Union policy and a fundamental element of that cohesion policy is the funds which we are discussing here. The regions which are at a lower level than the European Union average cannot do without these funds, with or without enlargement. It is therefore inherent to the European Union’s cohesion policy that the least-developed regions of the Union receive funds and resources so that they can try to eliminate the current territorial imbalances. As has been said, there is still a budgetary margin in the Union which can be used to meet these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that these reports refer to 1999. There are a series of criticisms about application, which should be taken into account. Let us hope that in 2001, thanks to the action of the Commissioner and his team, the restrictions and shortcomings pointed out may be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must bear in mind that the series of statistics analysed and the studies done on the long-term application of the funds in the European Union, with very few exceptions, demonstrate that in the least-favoured regions the level of imbalance in relation to the European Union average has been reduced. Therefore, since we are talking about the future application of these funds, this must be taken into account in the Union’s new policies in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also note that they agreed on an issue which seems to me essential and in no way hypocritical: there can be no political Europe without an economic Europe, there can be no political Europe without a cohesion policy. That is also the case in the current States, and the European Union must assume these responsibilities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be done? How can it be achieved and with what instruments? We clearly have to improve the current application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. We only have to look at the differences between Ireland and Spain, in terms of results over past years, or between Portugal and Italy or Greece, if you will allow me. The application has been different, and as such Ireland has made extraordinary progress and Portugal has taken better advantage of the Structural Funds than many other States. This has not been the case with Spain, Italy or Greece, where, while State income has come closer to the Community average, this has not been the case in their internal regions, which indicates that the Funds are being badly applied, possibly because the State has taken advantage of the funds intended for the regions or because the policy of additionality has not been applied in the State.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barnier, you have said, and you had said previously, that the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot be below 0.46% of Community GDP. I would remind you that this is the level they had in 1999 and that in 2006 it will be 0.31%. If in 1999, in view of the result, we had not managed to eliminate differences between the regions of Europe by means of these Funds, we must therefore be much more ambitious than you are proposing, although you have done so in a very positive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two parts to the response: on the one hand, the principles on which cohesion policies are to be based from 2006 onwards must be established and, on the other hand, the priorities must be set.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are two principles which must underpin cohesion policy: firstly, equal opportunities, and secondly, regionalisation. Modern economic theory teaches us, with a wealth of detail and supported by considerable empirical evidence, that the success of local development policies is strictly linked to an increase in the power of individuals to take autonomous decisions and to the projects for implementing regional policies which are acceptable to those voters.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, talking about regionalisation is the same as defining economic policies at local level so that they respect and appreciate the different assets of each region, and so that the local government institutions, subject to monitoring by the electorate making them politically accountable, can take collective decisions backed by genuine democratic support.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievement of these goals certainly requires a different type of statistic on the state of the economies, at both local and national and Community level. Data on <span class="italic">per capita</span> income are no longer sufficient to assess individuals’ opportunities for access in the European regions; we need much more: we need indicators which measure the degree of access to resources, indicators which measure the level of economic freedoms, which measure the level of fundamental human rights, which measure, in short, the quality of life.</p>

The European Union will not make progress in growing together if solidarity does not always play some part. We all know that those who are stronger and richer must help those who are poorer or not yet as strong or in the process of catching up. We are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and, of course, also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I want to take a look at the current state of our cohesion policy, in other words: how are we spending the money we have allocated to this truly vital EU policy? Right up to Agenda 2000, we used to have the stormiest debates about how much money was to be spent. If, though, we now look at how implementation is actually proceeding, we cannot but have grave doubts as to whether this is being taken seriously enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The new aid period began last year, so, of course, things cannot move as fast at the outset as they can halfway down the track, but it must be pointed out all the same that implementation is proceeding at a wretched rate in the various fields. There is simply no other way of putting it. This has been a frequent topic in the Committee on Budgets, and even the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has taken it up and will continue to discuss it.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at current discussions in the context of the Budget consultations – and here I must address my remarks to the Council – we see that the Council has allocated only 1% for next year's new liabilities, and that is then supposed to be converted into payments. One per cent of all we are prepared to commit, that is supposed to be paid out! We are producing a backlog, of the sort that we often used to have. We are piling up funds rather than fast-tracking aid, and fast aid is good aid, because we want many countries and regions no longer to need aid when enlargement actually comes about. If we really want to help them out of their plight, if we really want to make room for the new countries who want to join us, we must give aid fast and in concentrated form, in other words: there must be appropriate follow-up here.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission – which has already submitted proposals on this – but also upon the Council, to follow up words with actions, for cohesion is only any good as and when it actually reaches people, and that needs to be as soon as possible! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, a word of thanks also for emphasising again that there are no taboos in this discussion. We are at the beginning of this discussion process and, in this discussion, we should explore in depth all the options for auditing the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Holding 27 countries together economically and socially is a quite different matter from maintaining the cohesion of 15 of them. The solid fact is that the accession of 12 new States will substantially increase the disparities in the EU. On the one hand, the new Member States will have to be given priority, whilst on the other, the present beneficiary countries must not be denied a degree of continuity. We are well aware that the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund can still only be temporary measures and cannot be made part of the patrimony. However, regions must not lose their Objective 1 status after 2006 solely on the grounds that enlargement has brought an improvement in their relative position and without their having achieved sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the cohesion policy as being credible only if the financial means are apportioned on the basis of objective criteria applicable to all, with the criteria of national and regional prosperity forming the bases. The pending review of European regional policy must therefore throw up some solutions, and that is the whole point of the discussion process that is now beginning – to treat on an equal footing the situations both in the new Member States and in the Objective 1 regions of the present Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that this notion transcends European borders and is applied to other regions. This would probably be a solution to many conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that this is a good time for the debate, I must also recognise that, at least in my opinion, the responses from the Council and the Commission are unsatisfactory. Firstly, I find it difficult to believe that we can talk about social and economic cohesion without making the least reference to the single market and all the policies of the European Union. We are currently negotiating the Sixth Framework Programme, a programme which from the outset does not fulfil the cohesive conditions required of it by the Treaties. Economic and social cohesion demands that we take it into account in all our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Barnier asked this Parliament certain questions in this report. When we asked the Council these same questions, it indicated that this was not the appropriate time to answer them, but Parliament has the right to ask the Commission and the Council these questions so that we might know their opinion, before producing our report. I profoundly and fundamentally disagree with the Council’s attitude, and to a lesser extent with that of the Commissioner, because I believe that certain fundamental issues must be clarified immediately. We are talking about how the 2006 project is going to affect various regions in the future. If we do not do so we will constantly be talking in theory about this issue and we will never bring about the reform necessary for economic and social cohesion in Europe, because we will be looking askance at one another: some of us talking about how we have to remove the Cohesion Fund, others saying that certain regions have to leave it. This confusion will prevent us from getting down to a thorough analysis of the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, and quite rightly too, our European Union has decided to integrate new Member States whose per capita income is demonstrably lower. Is it logical, is it ethical and, hence, is it acceptable in the final analysis for the second objective to be achieved at the expense of the first? By which I mean that enlargement will reduce the new average per capita income considerably. The upside, of course, is that at least everyone realises that cohesion policy cannot continue with blinkers on as regards the 75% target and hence various scenarios have been proposed and are being debated, scenarios which may provide a way out but which are not a fair solution. It therefore makes sense, it is obvious in my book, to retain the first objective even for the enlarged European Union. In other words, all Member States, old and new, must exceed 75% of the average per capita income of the present 15 Member States. That would be consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally enlargement will need more money than it appears to have. So those who need to should take a realistic view of the new situation, they should approach it with an open mind, they should take a long-term view of the cost-benefit ratio of a revised, ambitious regional policy and they should not disappoint regions which continue to require help from Europe, from the Europe of their dreams, the Europe they believe in. We must realise, as did Demosthenes, one of the great figures of ancient Greece, when he said in ancient Greek, "... money, without it nothing we need to do can be done." And if the decisions have already been taken, well decisions are made to be revised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact remains that, despite the budgetary aid granted, European regions are far from being on an equal footing in terms of development. My colleague Mr Fruteau is especially concerned about the outermost regions. You will therefore understand that this current context of enlargement makes me fear that the European Union has its attention exclusively focused towards the East, which would be disastrous for a good number of European regions that are current beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Please understand me: I am not trying to call into question the pertinence of enlargement, which, of course, means the consolidation of peace on our continent, which in these difficult times, is a noble and fragile objective. On the contrary, I am thinking about the conditions in which it can succeed. I am, in fact, one of those who think that the success of enlargement will be the result of the strengthening of cohesion. But this cohesion has a price that should not be paid by the EU’s poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In concrete terms, Commissioner, I hope that the eligibility criteria of Objectives 1 and 2 will be very carefully revised in order that the poverty of some does not lead to the end of hope and the impoverishment of others.

In fact, there can be no political cohesion in the European Union without economic and social cohesion, despite what some of the federalists may think. On the other hand, however, there can be no economic and social cohesion without political cohesion, as hard as this may be for some nationalists to swallow. Cohesion policy, which has played a key role in recent years, will have an even more crucial role to play in future, as a result of enlargement. Cohesion policy is really a prerequisite for enlargement’s success. This goes without saying. Nevertheless, Mr President, there are certain paradoxes inherent in enlargement: by making the European Union poorer in terms of average per capita income, we will be making the countries that are currently the least favoured richer as if by some form of numerical magic. This is a problem. What my country, Portugal, and other cohesion countries cannot accept is, as a consequence of enlargement, being relegated to the margins of cohesion policy and becoming the victims of the statistical machinery that automatically places them over the critical threshold of 75%.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I feel that future cohesion policy must not stray from the following principles:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly: increasing the budgetary resources earmarked for cohesion; we cannot evade this issue, despite what Mr Walter has said;</p>

Personally, I myself had hoped, at this stage, at the very start of the debate, for a great deal of frankness, criticisms, as I said earlier, and suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, if you would allow me, I would like to say that I was disappointed by the remarks made by Mr Simpson earlier. I think they are particularly unfair. In a different way, Mr Izquierdo Collado has also shown a degree of impatience. With this in mind, I would ask each one of you, however, to be fair to the Commission. Since Mr Simpson wanted us to hark back to the past, by citing the name of a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect and friendship, my predecessor Mrs Wulf-Matthis, I would like to remind you of the timetable of the previous debate on the Berlin agenda. The forum that opened the debate for the Berlin agenda took place in 1996 for a 1999 European Council meeting opening the 2000-2006 agenda. Three years beforehand! If I had worked to the same timetable, it is not in January 2001 that I would have set the date for the start of the debate, it would be in two years time, in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot seriously be telling me today that the Commission is not aggressive enough, that you are waiting for us to make proposals. We are opening this debate two years early without taboos, without waiting for enlargement to have taken place. Once more, therefore, I would ask you to be fair with the Commission, and, when the time is right, after I have listened to you, listened to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the regions themselves and the Member States, you can count on me to show how bold I can be, how aggressive I can be if I have to, and to make tough proposals. But do not ask me today to conclude a debate that has only just started, two years in advance in relation to normal procedures. I have shown transparency. I have shown openness with the European Parliament. And I find it quite unfair that you have come here today to reproach me.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to say to President Hatzidakis, to Mrs Schroedter, to Mr Duin, to Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and to Mr Markov, who have, if I have understood them correctly, insisted more in their speeches on current management, that I agree with many of their remarks, to their calls for better take-up, the respect of commitments, the concern for true partnership in the regions. And I am, with the Directorate-General team, extremely concerned to ensure that the words found in the regulations – partnership, good take-up, rigour, parity, as well as others –become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few days time I shall appear, President Hatzidakis, before your Committee to tell you where we stand on 1994-1999 and on the subject of take-up that I hope is now finalised for the previous period, where there were still funds that were not used before 1994, and also to raise the alarm on the implementation of commitments and the first take-up of appropriations in the current period. I will make a very clear and very objective point to the Committee on Regional Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov has once again raised the issue of border regions. I recognise, Mr Markov, that the response we gave with Mr Verheugen is not entirely satisfactory in relation to the problems of border regions, but once more in this particular case, do not ask me today for more than I can give, for we work within a framework of which you are well aware, which you have approved, which is the Berlin framework. I have my own financial framework, which I cannot deviate from. I shall use all the margins of flexibility and manoeuvre possible, but I am, until 2006, obliged to work within the Berlin framework, and I cannot deviate from this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pohjamo, and others, brought up the subject of the financing of enlargement. Mr Pohjamo, I have to tell you that it is not for the Commission to make decisions on this matter. It is for the Council, the Council of Heads of State and Government in 2006, based on the proposals we make, and whilst we are on this subject I would like to say, as I could have said later to Mr Nogueira Román, Mr Walter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pittella, who talked about the aims and values of the EU as set out in this cohesion policy, I would like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2006 we will only make the right financial decisions if we first have a true and worthwhile political debate and if, naturally, within the framework of this debate and after this debate, the Commission, playing its proper role, puts forward proposals that are courageous and strong willed. You can count on myself, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler to put forward the positions and proposals that will follow whilst adapting and reforming cohesion policy. But allow me to tell you that in order to succeed with this challenge in 2004 or 2005, I need true political debate beforehand. I need you to provide the proof right here, in your countries and in talking to people about the usefulness of this regional policy, the need for it, its effects. If we do not provide this proof, then we should fear the ultimate financial decisions when they are made. I would invite you, therefore, in your political groups, amongst yourselves, between countries and regions, to participate in this debate, to react to the initial course led by the Commission and to make proposals yourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Raschhofer, you said we need to make reforms. I do not know if we have understood each other, but the debate is taking place for that reason and I am hoping that it will pave the way for reforms. In your speech, you used a word that I cannot ignore, because we must be very careful with the words we use. You talked about fraud. Personally, I am extremely strict. I am also ruthless on this question of rigour in the management of Structural Funds. There are probably errors. There are probably delays. There are often irregularities. But I have not observed in the reports from the Court of Auditors and the Parliament’s own Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control, that they have revealed many cases of fraud in relation to the management of Structural Funds. As for errors, delays or irregularities, we will progressively reduce these by taking the attitude I have just pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski has himself also started to participate in this debate, which I thank him for. So that there is no misunderstanding, when I mentioned the territorial dimension of the future policy, you will also see, Mr Jarzembowski, that in the cohesion report, I pointed out the title ‘Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory’ This is perhaps an idea that we can incorporate into the new and future Objective II policy, if there is still an Objective II policy, as I hope there is, that rather than creating a bit of bureaucracy, a bit of zoning, we should decentralise this policy using several European priorities we shall choose together. For each of these priorities, there could be a financial instrument in service, several financial instruments for the various major objectives that you have hoped and prayed for: assisting regions that have long-lasting natural handicaps, assisting urban policy, assisting cross-border cooperation. These are a few examples of territorial objectives. We can also find thematic goals such as the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Korakas, you also called for more confidence and regionalisation. I agree. I will make proposals in the new 2004 agenda for increased simplification and regionalisation, but, for me, the limit is to not permit the unravelling or the dismantling of this Cohesion policy which is one of the great and one of the strongest Community policies at the heart of European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berend, like others, has made a criticism, which I accept or at least understand, on the current criteria for per capita GDP. I am open to this type of criticism. But I would like to say that up to this point the criterion seemed the most fair and the most objective to me. It is accepted by all Member States. We have reliable statistics from the instruments we have been supplied with. And before this is changed, we should think hard so as to be as fair and as objective as we are with this criterion of per capita GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Darras, let me make it clear that when the time is right, I will put forward a regional and cohesion policy that will involve all EU countries. Naturally, we shall concentrate, as we have today, on the poorest regions and countries, for this is the true meaning of cohesion, created so that we can opt out of such a scheme when we are successful. I am not at all of the opinion that I should create a policy that would ignore other regions that have fewer difficulties but have specific projects and problems all the same, sometimes areas where there is much poverty. I will therefore, when the time is right, propose a policy that will involve, with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development, all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe, while endeavouring – I am responding here to Mr. Lage – to treat all of these regions even-handedly, in particular so as to avoid, Mr Lage, the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could, if applied without due care and attention, penalise regions currently within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
