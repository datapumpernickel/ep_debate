There is also a broad consensus that the present legislative framework is inadequate and must be supplemented by a Community strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides. That is why in my report I also welcome in detail all the Commission’s proposals. I believe that the Commission’s proposals are good but not ambitious enough, and the Commission is also not ambitious enough in its timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the resistance to the report and the vote on it in the Commission that we Members of the European Parliament have all experienced over the last few days, I would nevertheless like to linger for a moment on a number of challenges regarding this problem which concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Pesticides are increasingly becoming an environmental and health problem. We are not only talking about obsolete stocks of pesticides here, however, although it is important to tackle that problem very meticulously. We are talking about much more than that, however; our drinking water, our surface water and our groundwater contain more and more residues, and these days even rainwater no longer complies with drinking water standards. Drinking water companies must invest capital to remove these residues. Furthermore, about half of our fresh food contains residues.</p>
<p class="contents">The medical evidence that pesticides cause a number of Western diseases should be causing us great concern. Pesticides cause cancer, mental illnesses and fertility problems. If farmers are having to produce our food in a sort of spacesuit, should we not be asking ourselves whether we should not be organising our food production differently?</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, and for so many other reasons too numerous to mention here due to a lack of time, I want to emphasise in my report that we need a strategy to reduce use as well as a strategy to reduce risks. A sustainable solution for the future also lies in a systematic reduction in the use of chemicals in favour of preventative and other alternative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not solve resistance problems by using more but by using less. I challenge all of you to find a doctor who says that the problem of resistance to antibiotics can be solved by using more antibiotics. We know that this is impossible, so as far as that is concerned let us recognise the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point for attention for which there is a consensus in this Parliament is the need for greater scope for the strategy. Yes, the agricultural sector is extremely important, but governments – particularly local authorities – amateur gardeners, industry and the railways are also major users and it really would be foolish not to include these in our strategy. We must therefore not ignore these, just as we should not ignore the use of biocides.</p>
<p class="contents">Another difficult problem that is particularly controversial is the use of GMOs. Do we want to go from bad to worse or do we want to aim for sustainability? After all, the vast majority of genetically modified crops are resistant to herbicides. The agrochemical industry has promised that genetically modified crops will contribute greatly to reducing the use of pesticides and their risks. I would like to believe this, I would like to be open to it, but reality is proving them wrong. These promises are not currently coming true; after a few years, genetically-modified soya, genetically-modified maize and genetically-modified beet all require more herbicides than conventionally farmed crops. In our report we are asking for the precautionary principle to be applied and for GMOs not to simply be used as a safe and sustainable alternative. I am asking for no more than this, but I am also asking for no less.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the cost. In Europe we have still not properly added up what the use of pesticides actually costs society. As long as ten years ago the United States calculated that the social costs amount to approximately USD 2.5 to 4 billion per year. The question is: do we want to internalise that in the cost price, do we want the polluter to pay? That brings us to the use of taxes and levies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the present regulatory framework is inadequate. We are all in favour of setting out a number of steps. I am therefore asking my fellow MEPs to support the report, which I know is especially ambitious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Van Brempt, for the work that has gone into this report in reaction to the Commission’s Communication 'Towards a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides'.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth Environment Action Programme introduced the new concept of thematic strategies and requires the Commission to develop them in close consultation with all relevant parties. The Commission launched this broad consultation with the Communication. More than 150 comments were received via Internet and following a stakeholder conference with almost 200 participants, the Council adopted conclusions in December 2002 and the European Economic and Social Committee did so in January 2003. With this report of the European Parliament, the consultation process will be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the Parliament’s broad support towards the general approach and the main objectives presented in the Communication. The numerous detailed comments and requests contained in the resolution will be fully taken into account in the development of the future thematic strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw the attention of the Parliament to three particular issues raised in the resolution, where the Commission could face some difficulties with implementation. These issues are also addressed in the amendments tabled for the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one relates to the scope and goal of the future thematic strategy. The Parliament calls on the Commission to extend the scope to include all uses of plant protection products, agricultural and others, and also biocides. I can assure you that it has always been the Commission’s intention to cover all uses of plant protection products. But for the reasons already explained in the Communication, the Commission thinks that for the time being actions should be focused on plant protection products. Only these are also specifically referred to in the sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission takes note of the emphasis that Parliament's report puts on an overall quantitative reduction of the use of pesticides, whilst the Communication puts more emphasis on reducing the risks. I would like to underline once more that there is no direct link between the quantities of pesticides used and the risks they can pose to health and environment. In fact, there are cases where substances are much more active and can be used at lower volumes, but because of their higher activity they pose higher risks to the environment. Nevertheless, the Commission recognises the interest of seeking a reduction in use as one possible tool to achieve reduction of risks. Given that the Member States are setting out from very diverse starting points due to efforts made in the past, it is extremely difficult to establish overall quantitative use reduction targets. Such targets should, however, be considered by the Member States when they establish their national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Parliament's report urges the Commission to develop a regulatory framework for taxes and levies on pesticides. As outlined in the Communication, this is a very complicated area – in particular the calculation of the real externalities of pesticides – and the effects of introducing such levies in some Member States have been more limited than originally expected. The Commission will, therefore, have to examine the problem further before making any proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again that I consider the Parliament’s resolution to be a very important contribution in the consultation process. We can now get to work and start the development of the details of the strategy. I am confident that I can count on the Parliament’s continued support in our efforts to further improve the sustainable use of pesticides in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the proposals amount to a statement of the actions the Commission intends to take in the near future. To this end, it will either introduce measures of its own or submit legislative proposals to Parliament and to the Council of Ministers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, this report seeks to respond to people’s concern about the possible negative effects of pesticides. They can affect human health, animal health and also the environment. I would stress that this is mainly the case when they are not used in a rational or legal manner</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Commission’s proposal contains significant gaps. A great number of comments have therefore been made. The executive arm of the Community should take these into account when it comes to spelling out specific measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight what I believe to be the most relevant of the comments received. Firstly, the Commission’s proposal does not take account of the different problems encountered in using pesticides in different regions in Europe. The fact that the report does not differentiate between the regions of Europe will lead to false conclusions when the approach is applied in different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is not clear whether the Commission considers that organic farming should be the future model for agriculture to be applied throughout the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, we should de-mystify organic farming. I do not wish to remind anyone of the case of nitrophenol. Natural products and natural processes tend to be mistakenly equated to environmental protection. Petroleum, strychnine, hemlock and even anthrax are natural substances, but it is unacceptable to introduce these into the environment. Organic farming uses natural products but this does not mean it is the most desirable form of farming or the most desirable in every case.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no mention of Community policy on integrated production in the Commission’s proposal either. This is an important type of production that cannot be overlooked, especially as regards the use of plant protection products. The proposal does not take account of our ability to significantly reduce the use of pesticides through the use of genetically modified organisms. This would of course require fully transparent regulations to ensure there would be no negative repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to highlight another issue the Commission has failed to deal with. There is no reference to the approach to be followed in establishing appropriate indicators to measure the effectiveness of the different courses of action to ensure the objectives set out in the Commission’s document are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, all these provisions should also apply to the candidate countries and to all countries trading with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Plant protection agents contain substances that protect cultivated plants and keep them free of pests and diseases, and they can be applied and used in many ways. They are often indispensable in vegetable and fruit growing and in viticulture, for a producer's economic yield is essentially dependent on a good harvest, on which a business relies for its income and its survival. We cannot therefore take away from users the option of using plant protection agents where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to all of us that the effects of plant protection agents are not only beneficial. They can also involve hazards to human health and to the environment. Ten years ago, we enacted at EU level our own directive on plant protection agents, which stipulates in the most precise terms which active agent may be used on which plant and for what purpose. The Commission communication is supplementary to it, aims to manage risks better, and is therefore a step in absolutely the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses measures to further train farmers in state-of-the-art and targeted applications of plant protection agents, promotion of alternative concepts such as what is termed integrated crop management, harmonisation of VAT rates on plant protection agents in order to remove existing distortions of competition in the internal market, careful disposal of packaging and expert testing of agricultural machinery, for we see it as particularly important to maintain the purity of our drinking water. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is, in principle, in favour of the proper and up-to-date use of plant protection agents. Risks can be reduced only if cooperation between producers, users and the authorities is maximised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van Brempt's report goes beyond the Commission communication. Above all else, a legally-binding 50% reduction in the use of plant protection agents would involve additional risks. Experts have warned that such a reduction encourages the development of resistance. The resultant higher incidence of weeds then makes it necessary to use plant protection agents in larger quantities. As Mrs Redondo Jiménez pointed out earlier, the use of an active agent is, however, far more a matter of location, local weather conditions and a plant's general condition in terms of development and health. An obligatory levy on plant protection agents certainly does not minimise risks in real terms, any more than would the introduction of a pesticides passport and a total ban on spraying from the air. Any such ban would impose severe limitations, especially in viticulture.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot support the points I have just mentioned in Mrs Van Brempt's report. I therefore ask the Members of this House to support a realisable and practicable approach, one that will reduce risk without hindering users in their work, for Europe's fruit, vegetable and cereal farmers produce food for us all.</p>

If we are to do this, we must remove the barriers we ourselves have erected, which, in environmental policy, are mainly to be found at the level of the nation state. That agriculture's core activity is the production of healthy, safe and high-quality food is not a matter of dispute, but despite that – or indeed because of it – we have to be able to say that there is little disagreement among farmers that, in the interests of viable food production, plant protection agents should be applied to cultivated plants in order to avoid the reduction of yield or quality as a result of disease, pests and weeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The public associate the word ‘pesticide’ with poisons in the soil, plants and food; for many of them, who are at odds with farmers, it has become a rallying cry, but the reality is quite different. Without plant protection agents, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables and the production of wine are not manageable, so the only thing to do is to use the minimum of chemical agents to protect the plants from pathogens, pests and weed invasion while at the same time applying more powerful biological and mechanical alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as a key component of a sustainable plant protection strategy that integrated cultivation should become the normal mode of production in society. This will minimise the adverse effects of plant protection agents right across the countryside. However, an ecological rural economy will not enable this objective to be as generally achieved as it has to be. To say that is to state a sober fact and is no denial of the need to support the ecological rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain specific things that I regard as necessary and deserving of support. Harmonisation of maximum residue levels in food derived from plants across the EU is indispensable in order to protect consumers in the EU's internal market. What is no less necessary is harmonised licensing of plant protection agents. The mutual recognition principle must be allowed in each Member State until such time as that is accomplished. That is what the promotion of equal opportunities in competition requires.</p>
<p class="contents">With the present problems in fruit-growing and horticulture in mind, I urge that, before the substitution principle is introduced, the effects of the reduction in the agents permitted in the EU – from over 800 to some 300 by the end of 2000 – should be analysed. Existing notification procedures have not been laid down for anything like a sufficient period of time. As a result, we end up with restrictions, application provisions with time limits, or debt, the worst alternative solution, which is no sort of solution at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current scheme of things, manufacturers of plant protection agents are required to guarantee that their products meet the prescribed safety standards. Public scandals demonstrate the failure to consistently regulate these procedures. I am convinced that serious and genuine solutions will be achieved only when an obligation to label requires that the manufacturers of precursors give end users all the information that they need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of speakers have already pointed out how it is a proven fact that pesticides can cause cancer. Studies have shown how, for example, in Norway, the children of agricultural workers are at significantly greater risk of cancer. Other studies of a similar kind demonstrate that there is a clear causative link involved, and so we must make every effort, and the Commission too must send out a clear message by making pesticide reduction programmes mandatory. Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have shown us that pesticide reduction programmes can achieve a reduction in pesticide use of up to 70% within only a few years, without agricultural yields suffering as a result. A study by the American Environmental Agency made clear years ago that 90% of all pesticides are superfluous. Just imagine it – 90% of all pesticides are not needed! At the end of the day, the farmers who think that more is best, even though the very opposite is the case, also come off badly.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like, once again, to make it very clear that our group – as we have already shown in relation to Mr Lannoye's report – is committed to reducing the use of pesticides and wants to use a levy to ensure that their prices reflect the ecological facts, for, at the end of the day, it is the consumers who must pay higher prices for groundwater because pesticides continue to be so cheap and are used in such large quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is of the essence is that we want labelling to bring about greater transparency. Our problem is that, where the control of pesticides is concerned, the control authorities in the Member States are groping in the dark, because, to take one example, the German authorities do not know what pesticides are used in Spain or in Greece. The consequence of this is that we need some sort of labelling, a sort of passport, if effective controls are to be possible at all. I do think that this is where we have to make a really big effort, as excessive use of pesticides eventually means that we also have to consider the health costs involved. My great plea to you, Commissioner, is that your strategy should bring about a real reduction in pesticide use and make possible more labelling for the benefit of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Large-scale agriculture depends on these substances for the production of crops. It is not for nothing that these substances are known as plant protection products in the agricultural sector. We have known for decades that these substances cause problems for human and animal health. Today I read yet another report about grapes on the shelves of cut-price shops containing vastly excessive levels of plant protection product residues. It is well known that water companies have fewer and fewer opportunities to obtain clean drinking water. It is therefore important to reduce the use of pesticides and encourage the use of organic alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in principle in favour of clear objectives and timetables for every Member State. These binding national programmes must, however, take the current situation and the national and regional action programmes into account. As some Member States have already taken far-reaching measures to reduce the use of, the risks from and dependency on pesticides, it is reasonable to anticipate this. It is over-simplistic to attempt to reduce the use of pesticides by 50% within a period of 10 years. It is better to try to achieve an equal level of use throughout the different Member States. In other words, it does not mean that every Member State will have to reduce its usage by 50% but it will depend on what a Member State has already achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be aiming for harmonisation in the licensing of pesticides in order to prevent unfair competition, so the various pesticides should be evaluated more quickly. If we can achieve this harmonisation, a European tax on pesticides will no longer be necessary. The discussion on taxes will only result in delays in the Council, amongst other places. It is therefore better to leave the introduction of any taxes to the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to argue in favour of accepting some of the Amendments put forward by the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, particularly Nos 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9. In exchange for this, we can also expect wider support for the Van Brempt report, which that report deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with some of the rapporteur’s observations. The contamination of surface water is a cause of concern from the point of view of human and animal health. It is necessary to check pesticide levels in fruit and vegetables, as well as in foodstuffs of animal origin. Consumers have the right to be informed. I also agree with her analysis of GMOs. There is nothing to indicate that widespread use of GMOs will result in a reduction in the use of pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these points of agreement, I should like to refer to several points on which our views differ. First of all, as regards taxation, doing away with the Member States’ option to apply reduced rates of VAT is not acceptable to us. Member States will in practice be deprived of one of their sovereign powers. Moreover, as two speakers have pointed out, reducing the use of pesticides by half over the next ten years will only be feasible if there are reliable and less harmful substitute products available which do not, in particular, give rise to additional production costs which are incompatible with a market which has already been rendered vulnerable. I am also opposed to a general ban on aerial spraying in certain remote and inaccessible areas, such as mountain regions, and in extreme climatic conditions which make the usual forms of protection ineffective. This form of spraying is often the only choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the point which raised more questions for our delegation than any other concerns Natura 2000. Classified plots of land are likely to see farming activity reduced. Unfortunately that is the idea. We should like to see this economic activity, and leisure activities too, such as food gathering, hunting, rambling, fishing and mountaineering, which existed before site classification, being allowed to continue, and we want to avoid a situation in which over-protective measures might cause them to disappear in the long term. By refusing this possibility, Parliament would doom to failure the effective application of the protective measures. Today farming is the target, but tomorrow which other activities will be prohibited because they are held to be disruptive?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the farming world which I am seeking to defend here, allow me to express my concern about the direction that the rapporteur has chosen to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, each time that we talk about these issues, it seems to be almost a form of hatred for the farmers who buy and use phytosanitary products to guarantee their crop yields and exclude qualitative problems caused by pests and diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a fundamental question: whether quality can be separated from the concept of profitability of farms. It is clear that when I talk of quality – with the breadth of meaning of this concept – I am referring to the various stages of the production chain. Studying the Commission’s proposal, I cannot see a fitting analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the initiatives proposed in the thematic strategies which have been put forward for our consideration. This is a point which we have included in our Parliamentary position, but, following a logical thread, I get lost, because immediately afterwards I would like to understand the reasoning behind item 2 of the motion for a resolution – I am referring to Amendment No 10 – which proposes a minimum objective of a 50% reduction of the use of pesticides. I consider this to be a completely arbitrary figure, which does not take into account the qualitative aspects of phytosanitary products and, above all, overlooks the economic aspects of crop protection.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point concerns GMOs: this is a sensitive, problematic issue, too often dealt with in demagogic rather than scientific terms. In my opinion, use of the precautionary principle for GMOs calls for an appropriate level of consistency with the Union’s studies which are already underway and have not yet been completed. In this respect, the Commission has taken a very serious and wise position, indicating in the field trials when to evaluate the use of GMOs with the related risk of pesticide use. This is the right way to get tangible answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The heroine of this book is a raven-haired, stunningly good-looking Member of the European Parliament of indeterminate nationality who single-handedly takes on the evil chemical industry. Now, there has been much speculation in the European Parliament as to who might be the model for Irina Vega, with our rapporteur being the most widely mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, of course, <span class="italic">Troubled Waters</span> is not set in the real world. I am afraid that having read Kathleen Van Brempt's report, I think she has lost touch with the realities of modern agriculture. No farmer uses pesticides for fun – after all, they are expensive. Setting a reduction target at 50% is too simplistic, as we should be targeting the most toxic products, not those with a higher dose rate, as the Commissioner rightly said at the beginning. Of course, the European Union has turned its back on the new GM technology which has dramatically reduced the reliance on pesticides by our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic. Levies on pesticides will fall heavily on the new expensive products, which by and large cause less ecological concern than some of the older, cheaper, off-patent products. We all want to reduce our reliance on chemicals in agriculture but I regret that this report does not give us the solutions we want.</p>

That is to be welcomed. Over the years, the European Union has brought into being and implemented many directives and regulations relating to pesticides, some about the marketing of them, others about banning them from being marketed, but also about their use. So I see it as high time that the existing rules were implemented in full and their effectiveness assessed. The approval system needs to be improved. I see Community-wide licensing procedures for marketing as one of the indispensable principles of the common internal market. Substances permitted in such places as Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium cannot be banned in Austria or Germany. As far as I am concerned, a mere strategy of reduction – Mrs Van Brempt, in her report, proposes a reduction of 50% – is not efficient. Any reduction in the quantities used will always be dependent on the effectiveness of the means used.</p>
<p class="contents">It is self-evident that integrated husbandry has become part of everyday agricultural life. Methods of cultivation using low levels of pesticide use must be promoted and developed more vigorously, with risks being minimised and the protection of rural cultures – which is so necessary – being ensured. This is what makes counterproductive the prevention of professional and targeted application of pesticides using helicopters. Airborne plant protection means that a committee of experts takes integrated plant protection as its basis when deciding whether this treatment should be applied, and, if so, when and with how much. I see that as safer than if every small-time vinedresser or winegrower decides for himself and ends up on a steep slope right in a cloud of the plant protection agent he is spraying.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly opposed to the introduction of levies and taxes on plant protection agents. Increased cost means weaker competitiveness rather than leading to any real reduction in the use of pesticides. Let me say in conclusion that it is not acceptable that the European agricultural sector should be able to import from third countries foodstuffs and feedingstuffs treated with active agents prohibited in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Consumers want a very good quality product. In fact, they have become accustomed to this. Very often the quality of the product is due to the amount of pesticide with which it has been sprayed. I am almost committing a sin by actually mentioning it, but many crops are sprayed and, because of this, they are of a very good quality. Consumers demand high quality, and that is what they will buy. If they do not buy a product that is produced in the European Union because we have banned various chemicals, they will buy it from outside and this will put our farmers at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers in the European Union also want to grow many varied types of crops. If we are not careful, we will take many chemicals off the market and this will reduce the amount of crops we can grow. This is certainly not the intention of the Commission nor of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a place for organic farming, but we must accept that if the whole world was to embrace organic farming, we would starve. It is as simple as that. We would be unable to produce anywhere near enough food for the world if we were entirely on an organic system.</p>
<p class="contents">As one of my colleagues has mentioned, GMO agriculture would enable us to actually produce a plant which is resistant to many diseases and could be sprayed a great deal less. We could probably reduce the chemical use on these crops by even more than 50%, but, of course, we have closed our minds and our ears to the whole debate and, again, we are going to reduce the competitivity of European agriculture.

<p class="contents">Secondly, she talks about a distance of three metres from waterways. You must realise what that means, but in general, wherever there are a lot of things growing, you tend to find water. That means that particularly in areas where the natural conditions are good, efficient producers will ultimately be penalised. That cannot be right; it does not work that way.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that I am amazed that discussions about GMOs and crop protection are being mixed up here. I think that these discussions should be kept separate. I myself am very wary when it comes to GMOs, I acknowledge that, but I think that they have no place in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that the entire crop protection policy should be aimed at encouraging proper targets and not purely at punishment. I cannot see any sign of that in the report, and I would like to wholeheartedly advise everyone in Parliament to vote in favour of the PPE-DE amendments, as that means that we will get our feet back on the ground a little and at the same time work together to try and do things even better in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very striking; this is the first time I have ever heard such a battery of members of the European People's Party/European Democrat Group all saying the same thing one after the other. For the benefit of those listening, this Parliament does actually have other groups with different opinions .</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like very briefly to eliminate a few prejudices. For there are people here who would dearly like to class me as ‘a bit other-worldly, a bit naïve’, ‘someone who sits in their office working out rather peculiar proposals’. I really have not done that; I have, however, had a look, I have taken advice and I have, for example, seen that there has effectively been quite significant reduction in other Member States of the European Union, like in our esteemed Commissioner’s country. What can be done in Sweden can also be done in the Netherlands, in Belgium and in the United Kingdom. We can do that if we want to. I challenge everyone to scrutinise my report. Nowhere do I say that I am opposed to pesticides. I know they are necessary, even advisable. We can, however, cut down on their use. A reduction in use naturally goes hand in hand with a reduction in risk, which I believe to be more important, but because there is a consensus on this, I have not focused on it. I have also always maintained in the committee that this 50% is not a fetish of mine. Perhaps we should put 30%, perhaps 40%, perhaps 60%, but I would definitely like to see a target. After all, we all know that if this Parliament does not set a target , we will not actually make any progress. We must make sure – and this is one of the amendments I have submitted in the plenary session – that the efforts that have already been made by the other Member States and the efforts we still need to make, which differ from Member State to Member State, are also taken into consideration. Let me once again ask the members of the European People's Party/European Democrat Group not to look at my report dogmatically. I also try not to do that myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one more thing briefly. Everyone has run over their time, and they have all said the same thing, so I just want to say something about taxes. Someone said: ‘Naturally the taxes will not make the risks decrease.’ I am not stupid, I know that too. Why do we need these taxes? In order to ensure that the polluter-pays principle is implemented effectively. There are very many social costs, and I ask you: do you think that it is normal for everyone to bear the social costs or should they be borne in an honest way by the products that pollute? That is one of the many challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
