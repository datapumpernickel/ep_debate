<p class="contents">That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives, many thousands have been maimed, and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Tokyo in June 2003, the international community pledged USD 4.5 billion to underpin the peace process. It is therefore tragic that a constitutional crisis has occurred between the President and the Prime Minister, threatening to derail the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret the actions of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. I would appeal to her to pause and reflect on the consequences. I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE, she courageously initiated moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative. She invited the Norwegian Government to become involved as far back as 1997. She presented a draft constitution with proposals for devolution in 2000. I believe that history will justifiably acknowledge her contribution, if the present negotiations bring permanent peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Bi-partisanship in both the British and Irish Parliaments has been fundamental to the continuation of the Irish peace process, particularly when there were difficulties. It is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its actions today, the European Parliament, in sending once again a message of goodwill to Sri Lanka, is also expressing its wish for the President and the Prime Minister to work together in the national interest. We remain willing to assist them in the search for permanent peace in their beautiful country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The political divides and the rivalry between Sri Lanka’s President and its Prime Minister threaten the island’s stability and prosperity. Last week, in fact, three ministers were sacked, the parliament was suspended and a state of emergency was declared. The conflict between these leaders is based in particular on the issue of the attitude to be adopted in relation to the Tamil separatists. Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga wishes to suspend the peace talks with the separatists, while the Sri Lankan Prime Minister wants to continue with them. It is essential that some understanding be reached in order to put an end to the crisis of confidence that is rife among the population, who are already weary of the conflict involving the Tamil separatists, which has gone on for over twenty years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sri Lankan people are suffering and have suffered a great deal as a result of the terrorist acts carried out in their country and the climate of insecurity to which these have led. They hope for peace in their island and a stable future. Those are the facts that the Sri Lankan authorities must consider. While the Sri Lankans welcome the progress made in the peace process involving the Tamil separatists, the instability that the President has provoked leaves the country in the grip of a serious crisis of confidence, from both a political and an economic point of view. At a political level, the departure of the Norwegian negotiators, who played a key role in the peace negotiations between the Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government, is extremely regrettable. At an economic level, in the textile industry for example, numerous traders are complaining that many orders are being cancelled. Another sector that drives the country’s economy, the tourism industry, is unfortunately also in turmoil. The fact is that travel agents are also reporting a number of cancellations.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Sri Lankans believe that the gravity of the situation is directly linked to the attitude of the President, who refuses to continue with the peace talks. In light of this climate of hostility, we are calling on the Sri Lankan authorities to resolve these issues as quickly as possible so that they can finally offer their people the stability and the security they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negotiations having been suspended in April, the resumption of dialogue at the end of October with the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was a significant step forward on the road to peace. Institutionally speaking, substantial progress had been made towards the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>, however, by the President, Chandrika Kumaratunga, which interrupted the negotiations, was a giant leap backwards. The proclamation of a state of emergency, the concentration of the most important State posts – Ministers for the Interior, Defence and Information – in the hands of the President, the intervention of the army and the suspension of parliamentary activities all show that the situation is getting worse. It could deteriorate rapidly and even result in a resumption of the war and new elections with uncertain results.</p>
<p class="contents">The President’s accusations against the government and the uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire are very worrying. We support the efforts of the Prime Minister to engage in dialogue. The President must resume contacts with the Prime Minister as soon as possible in order to find a constitutional solution. At the same time, the cooperation must be extended to include all the political leaders and all interest groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever happens, the immediate end to the state of emergency is essential if the peace process is to be resumed immediately. In this respect, we fully support the Norwegian Government in its role as mediator and hope that it resumes its efforts as soon as possible. The situation is particularly worrying in relation to the issue of human rights. The emergency regime must not lead to an increase in infringements of fundamental freedoms. We are especially concerned about the risk of a fresh upsurge of police and military interventions and, above all, the risk of torture or inhumane treatment. In conclusion, we hope that the state of emergency does not slow down the distribution of the aid pledged at the Donor Conference in May. It is because we know that the peace process cannot move forward until internal relations are eased that we are calling for an end to the emergency regime as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the Sinhalese majority, Tamils – who are related to the inhabitants of southern India – predominate in the north-east, whilst descendents of Europeans from colonial times live in and around the capital, Colombo. Following independence, left and right within the ethnic majority have been fiercely opposed to each other. The two parties have alternated in government, and have lost face politically to a great extent in the meanwhile. They have been outbidding each other in their aversion to minorities. Sinhalese votes can be won by saying that the Tamils must move to India and that European cultural influences must be eliminated. It is only after a long, hopeless war of secession that a government has emerged ready to talk seriously with the Tamil resistance movement, which wants its own State. Norwegian assistance has played an indispensable part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the quest for self-glorification of the President, who belongs to a party whose origins I find more pleasant in themselves than those of the ruling party, that is now threatening to ruin everything again. Europe must give a clear signal that a lasting peace agreement is inescapable, and that resumption of the devastating war is unacceptable. Without a lasting solution for the north-east, the country will suffer disruption and people will be uprooted. Any illusions the ethnic majority, or the President, may have that things can continue without a solution to this problem will only lead to a repeat of the disasters of recent decades. For that reason, the outside world should make it as clear as possible that this is an unacceptable situation and that a peaceful solution really is needed.</p>

We met the former opposition leader, who is now the Head of Government. We spoke with Buddhists, Hindus and Christians, including Bishop Dr Joseph, who had a mediating role. We flew by helicopter to Jaffna, saw the villages that had been destroyed, and demonstrations by the people who wanted to go home.</p>
<p class="contents">The civil war had lasted twenty years, had claimed a toll of over 60 000 dead, and human rights organisations told us that ‘war is an institution’. A year later, though, there was a ceasefire, a triumph for the Norwegian peace mission, whose work has always enjoyed our support. They are perfectly justified in now closing their operation down in response to the home-made crisis for which President Chandrika Kumaratunga must bear responsibility. It was she who took control of three government ministries, she who dissolved the democratically-elected parliament and promptly declared the country to be in a state of emergency. She charged the prime minister with making too many concessions to the Tamil Tigers.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the two rivals, meeting in Colombo, agreed two days ago to set up a commission to lay down rules on the basis of which they could cooperate in future, the conflict does not appear to have been resolved. For that to happen, agreement is needed, enabling the initial favourable developments to be followed up. My party of visitors is well aware of that. Significantly fewer people are falling victim to violence. The security situation has improved in many parts of the country. More people are meeting across the line of demarcation, which was formerly hermetically sealed.</p>
<p class="contents">In economic terms, too, there are encouraging signs. Growth stands at around 5% this year. More support can be expected from the international community in the shape of USD 4.5 million in reconstruction aid following the Tokyo conference, to which Mr Rod has just referred. This is, however, dependent on a peace treaty soon being on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also been made in that representatives of the LTTE have, for the first time, agreed to free elections in the North. We wish the people of Sri Lanka a speedy end to private feuding in the interests of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For twenty years now, each political formation in power has sought to make peace with the Tamil Tigers and on each occasion the opposition has ruined the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, when the current Prime Minister was in opposition, he ruined the President’s plan to give greater autonomy to the Tamils in the north-east of the country, where they are in the majority. Since he has been Prime Minister, he has made significant progress in the negotiations with the LTTE, with the assistance of the Norwegian mediators, finally achieving a ceasefire that lasted several months and changed the people’s lives while allowing a limited economic upturn.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time since the movement came into being, the Tamil freedom fighters had just published concrete proposals for power-sharing in a region that, although run by the Tamils themselves, would continue to form part of Sri Lanka. These proposals were negotiable, but then the President took upon herself the heavy responsibility of halting this peace process, making the most of the Prime Minister’s trip to the United States and her constitutional prerogatives. She thus dissolved the parliament and recalled the Ministers for Defence, the Interior and Information in order to sack them.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the situation up until a few days ago. Today, the parliament has resumed its activities and the President is negotiating with her Prime Minister, which is why I feel that we must seize this opportunity. A conciliation commission has even been set up between the two arms of the executive. Our group sincerely believes that the European Parliament must send a very clear sign to the political leaders in Sri Lanka to encourage them to find a solution to the political crisis, but also, and above all, a constitutional solution that will allow for a lasting agreement with the Tamils. We also express our support for the Norwegian mediation team in its efforts to get the peace process back on track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has closely followed developments in Sri Lanka and is greatly concerned by the grave setback inflicted on the peace process by recent events, including the deployment of troops in the capital and the decision to bring the cabinet portfolios of defence, interior, and communications under the remit of the President.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council presidency and the Commission have issued a joint statement with Norway, the United States and Japan expressing our common concern that recent developments in Sri Lanka may jeopardise the spirit of cohabitation between the President and the government, which has proved vital to efforts to sustain the momentum of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency and the Commission urged the two principal parties to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution to the longstanding conflict. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten has repeatedly contacted the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe by telephone encouraging him to find a way to return to constructive and functional co-habitation with President Kumaratunga. The Commission will continue its efforts motivated by the hope that the tension can be reduced. The Commission is closely coordinating any action with Norway, as facilitator of the peace process, and with other co-chair countries. Naturally, the Commission remains in daily contact with its delegation in Colombo in order to keep abreast of all developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten will visit Sri Lanka on 25 and 26 November 2003 as planned. The visit will allow him to get a first-hand impression of the situation and discuss the significant issues with all relevant parties, and he will again be seeking to impress and reinforce the views of the Commission <span class="bold"></span> and indeed this House <span class="bold"></span> which have already been transmitted to all parties in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working in a coordinated manner with the Council. We welcome a resolution by this Parliament that encourages the Sri Lankan President and Government to return to the co-habitation that had prevailed since the last general election in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Keyser talked of the hope for an incipient restoration of normal relations. This is a hope that we share and are seeking to reinforce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
