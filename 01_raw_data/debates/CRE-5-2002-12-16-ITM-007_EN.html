<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, you have given me the floor as rapporteur but in fact the name on the report is that of Mrs Damião. I would like to begin by sincerely thanking her for the hard work that she has done on this dossier. Sadly, she is ill and is only slowly recovering. I know I speak for everyone when I say I wish her the fullest and speediest possible recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Council too for the adoption of a common position which strengthens the Commission's original proposal and also incorporates a number of the European Parliament's first reading amendments. Parliament particularly welcomes the inclusion of a new point in the proposed directive to prohibit all activities exposing workers to asbestos fibres, except demolition work and disposal of waste products resulting from demolition and removal work. The whole thrust of the proposal is to protect workers engaged in those activities and repair work, which will bring workers into contact with asbestos locked up in the built environment for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have adopted three amendments at second reading, designed to strengthen still further the common position. A quick word about each of those amendments: Article 3(3) of the proposal derogates from important elements of the directive in respect of workers whose exposure is of a sporadic and low intensity. This was too open-ended for the Employment Committee and, therefore, we wanted to pin down that definition of sporadic and low intensity still further.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 does this by specifying that Member States, in accordance with their normal tradition and practice, will consult with both sides of industry and lay down practical guidelines for determining work of this kind. We think that is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 makes provision for breaks for workers obliged to wear individual breathing equipment because of their potential exposure. Again, we think this is an important step. It is extremely uncomfortable to work for long periods in individual breathing equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council had some resistance to Amendment No 3 initially, but we felt it was important that we included a specific mention of sanctions and, in the end, we have included a text which has been used quite often in other social and employment dossiers in the past. We are quite pleased with that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we have had very good cooperation with the Danish Presidency on this dossier – to such an extent that we feel we can reach agreement at second reading with the assurances we now have from COREPER that the Council will be willing to accept these three amendments adopted in the Employment Committee. It is my hope that, with these three amendments adopted and voted upon tomorrow, the Danes can take this forward as an 'A' point on 20 December and they will be adopted very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I say I hope that will be the case because the deadline for amendments on this dossier closed only a few minutes ago. I hope that no groups have taken advantage of that deadline to table amendments. If they have, I can say with absolute certainty that those amendments will not be carried in the House – we know that from the margins in the Employment Committee. But it would delay the adoption of this dossier beyond the Danish Presidency into the spring – the earliest would be March under the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">That would simply lead to a further delay of weeks, if not months, before this directive could be agreed. That would put back its final adoption and implementation within the European Union and during that delay additional workers would inevitably be exposed to asbestos fibres and, over time, might die as a consequence of that exposure. So I hope no groups will take advantage of that deadline – if any have, I hope they will, even at this late stage, withdraw those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would hope we could include this on the voting list tomorrow. Everyone has had the amendments agreed in committee for a couple of weeks now in translation. That would allow the Commission to deal with this dossier at its meeting tomorrow afternoon and that, in turn, would allow the Danes to deal with it on 20 December. If we do not find that additional amendments have been tabled or if they are withdrawn, I would ask you, Mr President, to use your good offices to have this added to the voting list tomorrow lunchtime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want also to express my satisfaction at the unanimous conviction that the protection of workers against the risks of exposure to asbestos must be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attaches the greatest importance to all measures designed to protect the health and safety of workers. We have emphasised this interest in the social agenda and confirmed it in the Commission's communication on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work. It is with great satisfaction that I can inform you that the Commission fully accepts the three amendments that Parliament has proposed in this second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the House for the quality of the amendments presented, which are an expression of the European Parliament's preoccupation with the risks and effects of exposure to asbestos and the need to increase the levels of protection of European workers still exposed to asbestos. The Commission is convinced that the three proposed amendments improve the text and contribute to a better application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware of the great breakthrough already achieved by the Council's common position: the banning of all activities which expose workers to asbestos fibres during the extraction of asbestos or the manufacture and processing of asbestos products, or the manufacture and processing of products containing intentionally added asbestos, with some unavoidable and very limited exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Parliament, as well as the Danish Presidency and the Council, for their work to date on this issue. We should not forget that the effects of exposure to asbestos have dramatic repercussions for workers' health and even for their families. With the quick adoption of this important directive, we will demonstrate that the health and safety of our workforce is at the top of our agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, and not just because of the traditional closeness of the Galician and the Portuguese people, but also out of personal affection, I hope that she gets better soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Since work means risk, the issue of risk at work could probably be simplified into a simple formula: what percentage of risk has to be accepted? But it is also the case that certain risk agents are characterised by their almost imperceptible, hidden and silent, and therefore more dangerous, action.</p>
<p class="contents">Exposure to asbestos can cause serious illnesses, such as pleural and lung fibrosis and cancer of the lung, pleura or peritoneum. It can also cause other types of tumour, such as cancer of the larynx, of the rectum or of the urogenital system, regardless of the type of asbestos: amphibole or chrysotile.</p>
<p class="contents">Periods of incubation vary, according to the academics, from 20 to 50 years. Furthermore, there are still doubts and uncertainties about the effect of small inhaled doses and the limit and percentage of risk beneath which it is certain that cancer will not be caused, and the difference in risk between chrysotile asbestos – which seems to be less harmful – and amphibole asbestos, as well as the concern to prohibit the use of asbestos in work relating to the repair, refurbishment and restoration of buildings. In cases of demolition, workers can and must come into contact with asbestos despite the fact that this is prohibited globally.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, given the imminent enlargement of the European Union already agreed upon, it is extremely important that we modify Directive 83/477 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work owing to the use of products and materials containing asbestos in the future Member States. While it is mainly used in activities connected to construction, its use is not exclusive to that economic activity. In fact, it has been used in marine, aeronautical and industrial equipment construction and these can therefore be considered to be risk activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, reorienting the protection measures for the people suffering most exposure, studying the different risks arising from activities during which exposure is necessary, intensifying measures for preventing exposure or reducing it to a minimum and reviewing exposure levels, are objectives which justify the modification of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the rapporteur’s three amendments. Requesting practical orientation on the basis of social dialogue to prevent the consequences of sporadic or low intensity exposure. Calling for the provision of suitable breaks in situations of physical or climatic burden, which should also be established on the basis of social agreement. To ask the Member States to lay down sanctions which are effective, dissuasive and proportional – I believe that in the Spanish translation it should say ‘<span class="italic">proporcionada</span>’, since it is not a question of establishing a particular proportion, but rather of taking account of the seriousness of the violation, time of exposure, risk, etc. The three requests express a will to comply with the Lisbon strategy. That strategy spoke of better jobs and better jobs undoubtedly means safer jobs. I am therefore particularly pleased to hear that the Commissioner is in favour of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in order to be effective, all of this legislation, this modification, this updating of the legislation, requires other measures. As indicated by the health at work strategy 2002-2006, it is necessary to promote a culture of prevention. That prevention is the objective of the amendments I am referring to. Of course, the use of social dialogue will be the best method for spreading the culture of prevention of risks at work, in general, and of the risks resulting from the use of asbestos in particular. It will therefore be the best method for horizontalising policies, for research, compliance with the law and establishing health and safety conditions or, to put it another way, for respecting human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge that the timetable be complied with, because by complying with the timetable mentioned by Mr Hughes we will immediately improve the protection of the workers in question. We will therefore be complying with the provisions of Article 31 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Hughes for his efforts. In the absence of Mrs Damião, he has done excellent work in reaching the compromises which we have before us here in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Asbestos is a silent, invisible killer. Some 30 000 people per year in western Europe, North America, Japan and Australia die from asbestos exposure. According to a Belgian study presented last year to the European Respiratory Society Congress, it is estimated that one in seven city dwellers will show signs of lung damage caused by asbestos.</p>
<p class="contents">While exposure levels peaked in the 1970s, it takes years for many asbestos-related cancers to emerge. Medical practitioners in this area consequently predict that there will be a steady rise in the frequency of asbestos-linked cancers until the year 2020.</p>

<p class="contents">Every year 4 500 people die from asbestos-related diseases in the UK alone. It is predicted that 250 000 will die in the European Union of these diseases in the next 35 years. Medical and scientific evidence demonstrates that there is a real need for this directive. I am delighted that the production and marketing of asbestos will be banned across the EU from 2005. Thankfully, it has already been banned in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos in Europe's buildings throughout the European Union. Those buildings will have to be demolished at some point, and the asbestos will have to be removed, repaired or maintained, with the consequent effect on the health and safety of all those asbestos workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that this directive will lower the exposure limit values for asbestos. I emphatically support the three amendments Mr Hughes has talked about. However, I was extremely disappointed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs changed its mind after first reading; my amendments, which were not accepted, would have halved the exposure limit value. The committee's reasoning, as I understand it, was that, since the Council had not accepted my amendments, there was no point in going to conciliation as it would not have accepted them in future. However, we know from experience that the Council quite often changes it mind during the conciliation procedure, and it seems a great shame that we did not pursue those amendments. Had it saved just one asbestos worker's life, it would have been worth it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I decided against retabling the amendments because I did not have the support of the Committee on Employment or the other groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I would have liked to have seen the directive go further, it is still a very good directive and will save asbestos workers' lives across the EU. For that reason, I will advise my group to vote for this directive, because it is greatly needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the discussion of the directives on the protection of workers against asbestos once again illustrates that the EU is much more about the economy than about issues such as public health, and that the Council and the Commission want to keep it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 April, at first reading, I insisted that more should be done about asbestos than the Commission had proposed. This is necessary because this illness-inducing substance has for far too long been treated as the solution for everything, because dwellings and industrial buildings in Eastern Europe contain high levels of Russian asbestos and because also people other than those handling asbestos can become affected. Among those who are at risk are family members of asbestos workers, residents of dwellings that contain asbestos and people who are in the vicinity of asbestos removal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have already tried to extend the scope of the directive to include other victims and to increase public access to business information. Initially, I received wide support for this until the Commission pointed out the legal pitfalls. On that basis, I suggested inviting the Commission, before the end of 2003 and independently of this directive, to make additional proposals for damages and the protection of victims other than those exposed to asbestos in the course of their employment. The Commission is against this extension, and the Council feels even more strongly about it. It would, of course, be a step forward if a more stringent directive were to be adopted now, but it is disappointing to see which measures will not be included for the time being because of objections raised to them. The compromise that has been thrashed out and the three corresponding amendments are therefore, in my view, inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that we are talking in terms of adding the all-important, finishing touches to a directive that mainly deals with the position of employees. I am actually of the same mind as Mr Meijer, but I should like to repeat that it is relevant to all kinds of other categories of people who are involved, and we must certainly do something about this situation. These are my comments on Directive 83/477/EC. Like Mr Hughes, I am pleased that the impending deadlock, caused by the fact that Parliament's amendments had not been adopted, has been staved off thanks to an excellent contribution by the Council in the form of a common position and additional amendments that are somewhat more far-reaching.</p>
<p class="contents">This actually means that we have made a great deal of progress and that asbestos of any kind, albeit by-products or production, has been banned, and this finally after 25 years. I conclude from this that we, given the incubation time of 25 years or longer, must apply the precautionary principle more forcefully. I would refer to a few areas we have done absolutely nothing about, such as electromagnetic waves, optical radiation, OPS, softeners and their use. Not only should we tackle these products, we should also consider the use to which they are put in production processes. This automatically leads to the need for legislation and directives in those countries, but also sanctions, hence also an amendment. In addition, the partners should be involved; this all seems to make perfect sense to me. Who, though, maintains law and order in practice? Surely it is the trade union officials, workers who sit on works councils, sometimes specialist services in large companies, and they need to be able to fall back on something. This is why we need to focus on this in our forthcoming Health and Safety programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to see a register drawn up of those buildings, and in that sense, I would endorse Mr Meijer. This is, in fact, what we had asked for, but the Council, because of difficulties, did not immediately accept it. We shall therefore liaise with the Council and try to reach either a solution in terms of national registers or a solution in a different way, so that we know of the buildings we are talking about. I am familiar with one of them: the Commission building, but that has been razed to the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are used to meeting close to midnight, so it is splendid to be here today and see everyone awake.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that asbestos is one of the greatest threats to workers’ health in the EU. It is estimated that, over the next 35 years, up to 500 000 deaths will be directly related to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos. I think that experience with asbestos and the debate in Parliament and elsewhere show very clearly how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle very seriously. For many years, this principle was not taken seriously, and we can see the consequences today. I am therefore also pleased that all the groups in Parliament have chosen to support this directive. I cannot refrain from saying today that I should also like to see Liberals also being supportive in connection with other problems concerned with the working environment and showing a desire, which they have not always displayed, to take other problems in this area just as seriously as they have shown they take those arising from asbestos. Overall, the present proposal provides workers with better protection, and I am pleased that many of Parliament’s proposals have been approved by the Council. It is now proposed that employers should provide education programmes so that workers are clearer as to how they can protect themselves, and it is great progress that employers’ responsibility for this area has been made so very clear. I would also now call upon the Member States to go still further than the directive, and I believe that the three amendments adopted by the committee will improve the directive still further. It would, of course, also be splendid if the Council could express a positive attitude today, for it would mean that, quickly and within the coming week, we could bring our reading of this directive to a close, something which I would call upon us to do. There are many things we could have done better but, if we conclude the procedure now, it could save a number of workers from these very serious illnesses. I therefore hope that the Council will approve the amendments and that we can obtain a directive as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That, however, would mean forgetting the generations of workers who have died as a result of working with asbestos, even though its harmful nature was already known. It would mean forgetting the thousands of others who will die from it even once it has been banned, in a few months or years. It would also mean forgetting all the factory owners and shareholders who made a profit from asbestos knowing that it was lethal, who have been able to invest their ill-gotten gains in other sectors and whose wealth is still increasing, even as their victims continue to die.</p>
<p class="contents">These profiteers exploiting human suffering are not even experiencing any financial loss, for none of the European Member States is forcing them even to compensate all their current and future victims and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall, of course, vote for these amendments, but with a feeling of nausea and anger provoked by the servile behaviour of both the European and national political institutions towards the employers concerned.

It is quite symbolic that we are speaking about this matter at a reasonable time because it goes so much further than just health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning in the United Kingdom, in our flagship news programme, <span class="italic">the Today Programme</span>, unusually the question of asbestos was raised at another reasonable hour. It was raised because of the matter that Mrs Thorning-Schmidt raised, namely the implementation of this directive. So effective has the work been on this particular directive and matter, and so effective is the way the debate has gone and the agreement between the political groups that Member States are now looking carefully at the way we implement the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning the Health and Safety Executive set out for the United Kingdom exactly how this directive would be implemented, the way that even small- and medium-size enterprises would find a way through this health and safety legislation. It is important; it has huge agreement, but we must also understand the real dangers. Not only will the Member States start to implement this – and we must monitor it carefully – but candidate countries are using asbestos at a level we can only estimate, but it is quite a dangerous level. So we must set the tone through implementation of this directive, pay tribute to the way Parliament has discussed this and ensure that we in the EU Member States and the candidate countries make something of this directive to reflect the level of debate in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
