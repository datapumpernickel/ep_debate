As our means to this end, we opted deliberately for a legislative own-initiative report, which is very seldom used and requires a qualified majority, and we did so in order that our initiative might carry a good deal more weight. The fact that our report was adopted in Committee unanimously but for a few abstentions shows that a wide range of Members from all the political families will call on the Commission to at last do something about this, and I use the words ‘at last’ in view of the fact that the Commission ought to have stirred itself into action as long ago as May 2004, when its communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU was presented. That communication made it quite clear that the predicted failure to achieve the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption by 2010 was, in essence, attributable to poor market penetration by renewable heating and cooling technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, some 10% of heat is derived from renewable sources of energy such as solar thermal and geothermal energy and biomass – far less than half than what is potentially feasible in the medium or long term. Experts work on the assumption that it will, by 2020, be possible to derive at least 25% of the heat and cooling that we need from renewable energy resources, but those sources will be usable only if framework conditions change. The fact that the subsidies accorded by at least some Member States are dependent on their own budgets has, however, meant that development has not been really continuous but has been on a stop-start basis. What is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a European framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not reasonable to prescribe a European support system, and nor have we done so. What shape support is to take is for the Member States to decide; what matters is that they should actually give some and that all barriers that hinder progress should be removed. That means that administrative obstacles must be done away with, that transparent rules on competence must apply and that procedures relating to applications for authorisation must be unambiguous and streamlined.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report, we urge the Commission to present a proposal for a directive obliging the Member States to legislate in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources and also to draw up action plans for future development. The intention is that action should be taken on the basis of effective national goals and result in at least a twofold increase across the EU by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in the European Union, Commissioner, are waiting for the Commission to take action. They worry about the environment and our climate; among them are many small and medium-sized businesses with great potential for employment, who particularly want to make their contribution to the production of heat from the sun, the earth, and from biomass.</p>
<p class="contents">We were delighted to note that the biomass action plan included the announcement of the eventual production of a directive. I have since seen a preliminary draft of the Energy Green Paper, which has been floating around the corridors of Brussels, and was shocked to see that nowhere in it is there any reference to the need for new things to be done about heating. In this draft Green Paper, incredibly, there is scant reference to renewable energy sources at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you, Commissioner Piebalgs, will be able to allay my concerns following the reading of this draft Green Paper, and also that you will again display the commitment to efficiency and renewable energies for which we know you. I hope that you announce that the Commission will, this year, produce a proposal for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy.</p>

My services have already started to prepare an impact assessment on an action in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources. There is no doubt that the very complete and balanced report presented by Mrs Rothe will be very useful to the Commission when preparing action in this new field.</p>
<p class="contents">The international energy situation, our strong dependency on imports and the fight against climate change remind us of the urgent need to address the issues related to renewable energies. As you know, the Commission intends to adopt a Green Paper on a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy on 8 March. Whatever you have seen to date, it is not the Green Paper. The Green Paper will be adopted on 8 March by the whole college, and there will be no backtracking from energy efficiency and from renewable energies. It will also show that all these measures are necessary to build security of supply, to fight climate change and to achieve environmental objectives, as well as to increase competitiveness. We will strive to achieve a balanced approach, but that does not mean backtracking; that is clearly not the way we would like to present it. However, there is still some time before the Commission completes its work on this Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1997, the European Union has been working towards the objective of 12% of renewable energy balance by 2010 but, to date, we have achieved only half of that goal. While we now have legislation on the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy and on the promotion of biofuels, the production of heating and cooling from renewable energy – the third pillar of the renewable energy portfolio – lacks a specific strategy. Without a vigorous development of renewable energy in the sector of heating and cooling, the overall objective of 12% renewable energy by 2010 will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting heating and cooling from renewable energy will contribute to a number of important objectives: it will reduce our external energy dependency, it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it will create a European industry and promote local employment. It will therefore help us make progress towards the goals of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to react to some of the issues raised by Mrs Rothe’s report. I agree that we should take practical steps to promote heating and cooling from renewable energy more vigorously. I can promise you that we will work hard to table a legislative proposal as quickly as possible and certainly before the end of this year, since that is already in the 2006 work programme. However, there is a need to take a different approach from earlier directives, because the key problems lie in market confidence and attitudes rather than costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity is another key issue. By nature, all these energies are decentralised and will, therefore, have to be implemented at local level. We have to tailor our legislation to take account of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond a legislative instrument, it might be interesting to evaluate what progress could be made through standardisation. I am convinced that we should set the scene for industry to develop a market for this type of equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Rothe’s report contributes to the objectives of the European energy policy, and I very much welcome it.</p>

This directive is, in actual fact, the keystone of European energy policy. Mrs Rothe’s report, which is one of Parliament’s initiatives, is therefore very timely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament have decided in favour of doubling the present share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption for heating and cooling by 2020. In many cases, this energy can be generated locally, and the technology needed to do so – not least that using sun, wind, water, bio-mass and soil heat – has improved substantially. </p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Europe is ahead in terms of technological expertise, we are lagging behind where its practical application is concerned. Europe must become the front runner in product innovation and commercialisation. If this rate of development in the sector is set to continue, many jobs will also be created. We only have to look at the German example, where between 1998 and 2002, employment in the energy sector doubled to approximately 125 000 jobs as a consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement this policy, the Member States must put forward viable national objectives and provide for an energy mix within the constraints of their own possibilities. The PPE-DE Group is opposed to overregulation and binding objectives at the present time. This may be ambitious, but it is mainly realistic, and that is why we have decided in favour of effective national objectives combined with viable targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs to make better use of the scope for financial support from the Structural Funds in the period 2007-2013. The guidelines provide for opportunities, but it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not to seize them. In this incentives policy too, we must ensure that these priorities are in place with the Union’s and Member States’ existing funds. This is a cry from the heart which I would like you to take home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the approach she has chosen and, obviously, her idea for a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few months have shown in no uncertain way how important it is to develop alternative energy sources and make energy savings. It is vitally important to reduce Europe’s dependence on imports of fossil fuels and energy once and for all. How will we be able to cope with a dependence rate of 70% in the year 2030? Our future will be in outside hands, therefore, if we do not change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be support in the European Union for new technology and innovations which make use of alternative forms of energy for heating and cooling. These innovations could substantially extend our range of energy sources. The use of biomass and new technologies will create jobs and business opportunities, and so they are a good thing from this point of view as well. I am happy that the Commission has just approved the work programme which will begin the implementation of the Intelligent Energy Europe programme. I believe that Parliament will give this measure its support.</p>
<p class="contents">Under this programme, a series of SWOT analyses were undertaken on the Union’s initiative. These aim specifically to promote heating and cooling though the use of renewable energy sources and heat pumps. This new technique has now already proved to be a way of significantly reducing electrical consumption in heating and cooling – by up to a third, in fact. By using equipment such as this, which can be assembled and installed easily anywhere in a building, we can achieve enormous savings in energy. I believe that it is better to cut down consumption, which is also a good guiding principle in life generally.</p>
<p class="contents">This was brief, but I wanted to say it. I believe that our Commissioner has now heard what we wanted to say.</p>

There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain. In accordance with the ambition stated in the Commission’s 1997 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, ‘Energy for the future: renewable sources of energy’, we are eager to supplement the two directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources in relation to, respectively, electricity and transport with a third directive, this time in relation to heating.</p>
<p class="contents">Of Europe’s total energy consumption, almost half goes on heating. Given today’s warning signals concerning climate change and in view of the fact that we are so dependent on imports of traditional energy sources with consequent high carbon dioxide emissions, it is extremely important for us to exploit the huge potential for renewable energy sources in Europe, together with our existing resources in terms of such renewables. There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector. Allow me to mention a few of them. We should reduce carbon dioxide emissions; we should reduce our dependency on imports and increase the degree to which we are self-sufficient in Europe; we should not be as easily affected by energy crises in other parts of the world; and, by promoting renewable energy sources, we should provide incentives for innovation and technical development within this area which, in turn, would lead to further cleaner and more efficient energy consumption. The fact that the choice of renewable energy source would be made in the light of each Member State’s requirements would mean that we should be contributing to regional development. Moreover, we should be creating a lot of jobs, as this is one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the needs and the benefits, but how do we meet these needs and obtain these benefits? I believe that nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy is a first step, but it is not enough. I hope that the Commission will also create the basic conditions required if companies are to dare to make long-term investments in technology that will permit the increased use of renewable energy sources, and I call on it to do so. I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and, again, I call on it to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would draw attention to the technical solutions that already exist whereby we might obtain more efficient use of the energy we exploit to heat houses, namely district heating. Technical solutions and choices of energy source go hand in hand. Modern, technically advanced district heating is part of the solution, and it may also be combined with what is known as trigeneration electricity production.</p>
<p class="contents">This own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation. I hope that the Commission will quickly follow up this initiative so that we lose no time in obtaining the incentives needed for changing over to using an ever higher proportion of renewable energy sources for heating Europe or cooling it down.</p>
<p class="contents">As Einstein once said, a whole new way of thinking is required for solving the problems we have created through our old way of thinking. Parliament has made important efforts in this direction. We now hope that the Commission will complete the work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks, Mrs Rothe, you tireless campaigner, for this good piece of work. I would like to give an example of the potential involved here; in Upper Austria, 1 500 new houses are built every year. Ten years ago, 1 200 of them were fitted with oil heating. In Upper Austria this year, only seven were so equipped; all the others used biomass, networks or pellets instead for heating. That created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers, so that today, indeed, oil merchants have gone over to selling pellets.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the way we must go, or, to put it another way, we have to take the good practice that is to be found at the local and regional levels, and put it to work across Europe. I might add that Denmark, too, has done exemplary work in this respect, an example that we in this House will, this afternoon, vote to follow. It will then be for you to put the work in.</p>
<p class="contents">Just another thing on the subject of the Green Paper, Commissioner: if we are to win Europeans over, there needs to be a chapter in it with the title ‘<span class="italic">Winning the hearts of Europeans, going on with renewals!</span>’ That is what the people of Europe expect of us, and you should not fall short of that standard.</p>

It provides an accurate outline of the current situation regarding the use of renewable sources of energy for heating and cooling. On the other hand, the European Parliament has repeatedly declared the need for greater use of renewables, and adopted the correct decisions and recommendations, only for little to change. Politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area, that is to say the general public. One reason for this may be that the Member States have not been able to create the right conditions for the greater use of renewables and have not convinced people of the case for them. Consequently, as the report states, northern Denmark uses more solar energy than southern Italy, for example. The recommendations therefore attach great importance to informing and persuading people. They will only really take this on board, however, when renewables become more advantageous for them. The price of these types of energy is therefore important and this is part and parcel of creating the right conditions for the use of renewables. A current example of this from the Czech Republic does not directly involve renewables, but is all the more instructive for that. When the call was raised for the use of natural gas as a more environmentally-friendly form of heating, it brought a quick response, not only from individuals, but also from local and municipal authorities, who compared it with other fuels and, supported by various instruments, switched to gas. Now, however, after several major increases in gas prices they are returning in large numbers to types of fuel that are very bad for the environment, such as cheap and low-grade forms of coal, along with the inefficient burning not only of wood but even of plastics and tyres in local heating plants. They can, in short, no longer afford gas. It is therefore just as important to create the right conditions as it is to take sensible decisions, to make use of all the elements in the energy mix and to support energy saving measures. Otherwise, we may find ourselves following the example of the moth which, in its longing to draw closer to light and heat, often finds only death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Heating, cooling and the use of renewable energy are part of the broader issue of security of the European Union’s energy supply. There is more to saving energy than protecting the environment. It also has a significant bearing on the economy and is linked to the development of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of this problem has been highlighted by recent cases of energy terrorism. I refer to increasing the cost of fuel, with negative implications for the financial health of businesses and the citizens’ standard of living. I should like to mention three concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, setting 2020 as the time period within which to implement programmes on energy saving suggests a static approach to the challenge. It fails to take account of activities on the global market, and amounts to inertia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, tax concessions and lower VAT rates should apply to all activities involving the use, exploitation and creation of new sources of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the use of currently unexploited agricultural land for the production of biomass and sustainable fuels should be speeded up. The regulation of agricultural production in the European Union comes into play here, together with the lack of appropriate subsidies for the production of vegetables and fruit, notably soft fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of unexploited land is set to increase, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment in rural areas. If the production of the biomass and fuels I mentioned is developed quickly, it will create employment and improve the security of energy supply for our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I assume that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions will form part of any responsible energy plan. I firmly believe that, along with the nuclear plants that serve mainly for generating electricity, it is chiefly through the use of renewables for heating and cooling that we will manage to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the future. The less we use fossil fuels for these purposes the better, not only from the standpoint of global climate change, but also from the standpoint of reducing dependence on imports from outside Europe. The use of renewables also has a largely positive influence on the rural economy, which is where the new energy plants will be located, with the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which the rapporteur has drawn up on the basis of detailed investigations and discussions, presents a whole raft of strategic measures that must be implemented if we are to overcome the obstacles to greater use of renewables. Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, however, I must state that the position of renewables on the market weakened after accession to the EU because the mandatory bracketing of, for example, briquettes and pellets made from biomass into higher VAT bands led to a sharp decline in a market that had been showing promising signs of development. All of the new Member States are in the same situation. It is paradoxical that the neighbouring states of Germany and Austria have exceptions allowing these products to be bracketed in a lower VAT band. This has brought about a situation where the Czech Republic’s entire output of briquettes and pellets made from biomass is exported to these countries. At the same time, our domestic market is seeing an increase in energy costs and, rather than switching to renewables, people are instead opting for cheaper energy sources, which in our case often means low-grade brown coal.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore strongly endorse the call from the Commission and the Council for a revision of the Sixth Council Directive, allowing the implementation of lower VAT rates for renewables. We can and must do this at European level. I support the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing a good job. I should also like to say that this offers a promising way forward for the Commission and the individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we know, the present energy market in the European Union is severely distorted. Among other things, this is due to uneven subsidisation and the fact that subsidies for fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, oil shale) and nuclear energy are considerably greater than those for renewable energy. In several Member States, this situation has been brought about by the monopolistic position of those power plants that use fossil fuels. This situation has also been the primary obstacle to the formation of a common energy policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, given that our external supply reliability is inadequate as well, one can only hope that the lesson Russia taught Europe at the beginning of the year will offer an additional stimulus to the development of renewable energy in the European Union, and that improving cooperation between the Member States will indeed lead us to a common European energy policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank both Mrs Hall for the valuable work she has done on this resolution, along with the other shadow rapporteurs, and the rapporteur herself, whose skilful mediation and collation work has led to a text that enjoys broad support in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective that the European Parliament is setting itself with this resolution is an ambitious one in my view. First of all, it is ambitious in its methods, because Parliament is taking a proactive role under the Rule 39 procedure and is calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative act that is needed to fill a gap, to put that missing piece in place in the structure of the legislative and legal framework. That will enable us to make significant progress towards the use of renewable energies, in particular for the heating and cooling sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I think everyone is surprised to learn that 50% of Europe’s energy requirements are used for heating. That reveals the obvious need for a legislative provision, without which the sector cannot grow – something that was also acknowledged by the Commission in its report on energy efficiency. The sector also needs to be given some certainty. Without the certainty of possible growth there will be no investment and no research; in short, there will not be that kind of concentration of resources and energies that will enable the sector to make a qualitative leap.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament’s objective is also important and ambitious in that it sets a deadline of 2020. Some may perhaps consider that deadline to be rather timid and limited, but I believe we should see it as a target to beat.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about a share of over 20%, we are hoping to achieve a significant percentage, more than double the current share for renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that there is a clear commitment in Parliament and from certain Members – I see Vittorio Prodi is here for the subject of biomass. We also call on the Commission – and, subsequently, the Member States when implementing the directive – to work particularly hard to reduce our energy dependence, which might have a serious effect on our future growth and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do believe, though, that we must make a big issue of heating with renewable energies too. Why? Their potential is particularly great. The association for that industry in my own country, Germany – the one I know best – talks in terms of our being able, in the space of ten years, to increase the proportion of newly-installed plant running on renewable energies from 8 to 80%, that is to say ten-fold. That involves a tenfold multiplication of the new installations rather than the share in energy use across the board. It is not Greenpeace that is saying this, but an industrial association. The use of renewable energies for heating purposes is also good value in comparison to other sources of energy, such as solar radiation or photovoltaic cells; prices can often differ by a ratio of 1 to 45. We have, then given the least support where there was the greatest potential, and so something has to change in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this is not just a national issue, but also a European one, for the reason why heating and cooling with renewable energies is not yet the order of the day has nothing to do with the generally complex technology. What is needed instead is for the equipment to be produced in larger quantities in order to achieve a critical mass at which the equipment becomes better value for the end user. It will of course be easier to reach this critical mass at European level than it would be if every country were to work for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that endorsement of Mrs Rothe’s report in any way contradicts my support, and my party’s, for nuclear power. I believe that both renewable energy and atomic energy are needed. The false antithesis must be done away with; it must be removed from the Green Paper, too, and it is for that reason that I also endorse what has been said about that document. What is needed, and as soon as possible, is a concrete proposal from the Commission, and I am obliged to Commissioner Piebalgs for announcing that one will be forthcoming in 2006; that means that umpteen billions spent by European consumers on imported energy can be saved and the money invested in something more constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are only a few regions in Europe that have formulated and implemented successful strategies for energy generation from renewable sources. Differences in development are not based on differences in opportunities but on political agendas. The only way forward is to set major targets jointly, I reiterate the word jointly, and to monitor their attainment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that it is essential to offer incentives to investors who go down the road of renewable energy sources. One of the proposed incentives, also mentioned by my colleague, Mr Březina, would be to offer a lower VAT rate. It is a good incentive, but on the other hand it will not motivate countries with a flat-rate tax. I believe that the future of Europe will not move in the direction of the flat-rate tax. However, we need to take account of the fact that countries that have already implemented the flat-rate tax will not be willing to give it up.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to provide an example. The city where I have held the office of mayor for the past seven years is generating 15% of its energy from renewable sources. Thanks in part to the Structural Funds, that proportion will reach 50% in two years’ time, something for which I would like express my gratitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we add to all of this the unstable situation in the Middle East, the conclusion is clear: the European Union must act urgently.

<p class="contents">I do not doubt that the initiatives announced by the Commissioner will have significant benefits for the Union’s future, but we cannot forget the legislation that has already entered into force and that has not been transposed into national legislation by certain Member States with sufficient rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that current oil prices provide a reference for the thresholds of viability for replacement technologies: there is a great opportunity here for renewable energy sources to reach competitive prices with public aid, in line with the legislation on State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has correctly diagnosed, compliance with the directive on renewable energy sources is turning out to be difficult.

A large proportion of the urban population there live in poor quality apartment blocks, built 20-40 years ago, if not earlier. These buildings have little heat insulation, heat use is regulated from a central boiler, and residents are unable to select the desired temperature. Both national governments and the European Commission should devote more attention to this problem. Money from the Union and Structural Funds should be allocated for the renovation of such buildings, in order to guarantee that homes are heated efficiently. The Commission could collate the best examples of similar house reconstructions, in order to help national governments decide whether to renovate or demolish such buildings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7 December last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise three points that I see as important. First of all, on 28 January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010. The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article 12(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity. The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity.</p>

Indeed it brings to the fore concern for the environment, the encouragement of innovation and the infrastructure that must facilitate competitiveness and independent growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Renewable energy sources are the natural wealth of the European Union, reducing our dependence on imports and improving our environment. At the same time their use increases the diversity of energy sources, and improves the reliability of energy supply. We must exploit them not simply to produce electricity, but also for heating and cooling buildings, since that alone accounts for more than 40% of the use of all energy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent Eurobarometer survey showed that people support a common European energy policy. For this reason in Europe we must also formulate clear guidelines and incentives in the area of cooling and heating. We must set ourselves a common goal, but leave it to the Member States to formulate their own national goals, which should be rational and binding. Goals must be set relative to the natural features of individual countries, since they do not all enjoy the same conditions, for instance in the exploitation of solar energy or biomass.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact it is precisely with biomass that we should exercise particular caution over how to encourage its use. It is also a raw material for the wood processing industry, and serves to create numerous jobs and high added value. By using wood as a natural material, less energy is used in making the final product, while at the same time this reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and the wood retains the carbon dioxide, that has built up in the tree over a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">May I close by pointing out that for energy purposes it is prudent to use only wood waste that is unsuitable for recycling, while the rest can be processed into useful raw materials. The European energy policy must also be formulated to accommodate this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the price of imported energy is rising, and energy is imported from politically and economically unstable regions. These facts are forcing us to reduce, and if possible, eliminate our dependency on imported energy and our vulnerability. To this end, apart from rationalising our energy consumption and making it more efficient, we must also increase the use of renewable energy sources situated in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The steps taken in this respect by the European Union in the last decade have proved to be successful: in respect of wind energy, the EU reached the target set for 2010 as early as the end of last year, biomass power plants are spreading dynamically, and biofuels are gaining ground spectacularly. What is the secret of this success? I am convinced that it is mainly the EU regulations and mandatory standards accepted here, in Parliament. I am against overregulation, but it would be difficult to deny that the legal constraints imposed by the European Union and the targets that we have jointly set are efficient means in urging Member States forward. Cooling and heating in the household sector constitute 40% of our current energy consumption. On average, renewable energy is used in 10% of European homes, but this figure is only due to the outstanding performance of a few countries, such as Austria, Germany, Greece, etc. Other countries, including my own, are hardly using any renewable energy at all, they are not supporting investments in this area and have no government programmes – on the contrary, they are creating administrative obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">This area must be regulated at European Union level, to enable us to reduce efficiently and at a relatively low cost the utilisation of fossil energy in households, the emission of greenhouse gases and our energy-dependency.

These three considerations must always be seen in context.</p>
<p class="contents">The slogan ‘think globally and act locally’ also applies here. We must be constantly aware of the global situation, while also focusing on how measures can be put into practice. When issuing building permits or permission to develop land, the authorities should give priority to installations using renewable energy and hence helping to achieve the Kyoto goal. I regard the proposal that a decision should be required two months following submission of the application as being an absolute priority, for time is catching up with us, and we should also provide for the burden of proof to be reversed in this regard if the authorities turn down a plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary that projects should yield a return on investment in them, and here a wide range of options are available to us. I see energy services as presenting, in future, a tremendous opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. Some of those Members who have already spoken have – in view of the services directive that we will be agreeing to adopt this week – highlighted the wholly new challenges that cross-border energy supply presents to each and every Member State and the need for simplified procedures in this area. One particular priority is that bureaucracy should cease to put obstacles in the way.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters in the final analysis is that domestic resources be used and small circuits promoted. That is what we aim to do, and we want to achieve it together with the Commission.</p>

We have, since January, been debating our dependence on individual suppliers, and we have become aware of the need for action in this area. It is right, then, that we should also be asking ourselves how we can develop new and additional capacities for heating and cooling. That is both right and vital, and I am grateful, too, for the many amendments that have been accepted and incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that we may well be setting ourselves the right goal – of cutting back on consumption and accessing new and renewable energy sources – but that this may be giving us tunnel vision and causing us to believe that this way alone is the right one, that it alone is rationally justifiable and the way of salvation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am wary of approaches that give people the idea that there is but one thing that needs to be done and then all our problems will be solved – what Mr Turmes had to say just now tended in that direction. I am firmly convinced, on the other hand – and I agree with those Members who say this – that, while this is an additional option, and one that we must avail ourselves of, it will not spare us the need to answer other questions, for example, to questions like, ‘How do we handle nuclear power?’ or ‘How do we go about using the fossil fuels that we already have in a cleaner way?’</p>
<p class="contents">I also have my doubts when it comes to the method we should adopt or the means whereby we arrive at the new regulations for the future, for the question arises, and it is a pressing one, of whether we are on the right track if we believe that the only way to come up with solutions to political problems is by way of devising new regulations or by this House adopting them, after which we relax and tell ourselves that everything has now been sorted out. Directives making new impositions on the Member States are not the answer.</p>

To cut a long story short, the way ahead must be to promote new technologies and benchmarks and develop standards and indicators, so that those who ultimately have to take the decision as to whether to take a new tack are enabled to make comparisons and see where the opportunities and their own advantages lie.</p>
<p class="contents">Dreams will not be enough; what will be are ambitious but realistic objectives differing from nation to nation and dependent on different natural environments and different individual markets. It is for that reason that ‘one size fits all’ answers are no use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that you all feel passionately about this subject, and this is definitely not the only answer that we should be looking for in the energy sector. I am also passionate about this report. The vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the debate today have demonstrated very impressive support for the ideas expressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commission has already taken strong steps in this direction. In the Biomass Action Plan in December 2005 the Commission announced that it would work towards an initiative on heating and cooling from renewable energy sources. But at the same time, as some Members have indicated, we care about better legislation and delivering legislation that can be implemented properly and respect the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I have asked my services to deliver an impact assessment in this area, because it will also be very important later on in the debate to steer the proposal on the basis of a proper impact assessment. On the basis of this impact assessment, I will take a further decision on how to take this important subject further.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the same time I can tell you that the Commission will meet your expectations, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca mentioned, and we are working not only in this direction but also for the implementation of legislation. Today I am pleased to inform the Committee on Industry of exactly what we are doing in this respect. We have adopted the Biomass Action Plan that I have already mentioned, and recently we adopted the communication on biofuels. That shows that the Commission is very serious about achieving better penetration of renewable energies in a European energy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for your huge interest in this debate and I hope that by the end of this year I will be able to present a legislative proposal to this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
