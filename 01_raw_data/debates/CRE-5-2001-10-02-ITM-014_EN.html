The central statement is that the Commission is called upon to produce a detailed study of the possible implications of the transition to the principle of international exhaustion by 31 December 2002. The Nera study presented by the Commission in 1999 fails to deal with this matter adequately. A trade mark right has its effects only in the territory for which it was granted. Community exhaustion applies to the Community mark and national marks when the holder of the right has put his product into circulation in the Community for the first time. If the holder of the trade mark right puts his product into circulation outside the Community, the legal effects of the marks are not exhausted in the Community. He can therefore prevent parallel importers from importing the product into the Community. Because of the current Community-wide exhaustion regime he can therefore quote two different prices: a lower one for countries outside the Community and a higher one for the Community itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This split pricing policy, however, is not what the trade mark right is about. The main purpose of the mark is to make the product distinguishable and familiar and to indicate a certain product quality. We could also speak about the advertising effect. The division of markets to the disadvantage of consumers in the Community cannot be the objective of granting a Community trade mark. Neither is there anything in competition law to argue against parallel imports. So why should it be possible to use trade mark rights to prevent them? There is something wrong there.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do something to get back to more competition and lower prices for branded goods. The same conclusion was reached in a study by the Swedish competition authority, as, too, did a discussion paper by the Irish competition authority. A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now an important new factor: the increasing amount of trade on the Internet. The present exhaustion regime could hamper the development of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. It is not in fact certain whether Internet sales with the subsequent dispatch of branded goods are permissible under trade mark law. But legal certainty and consumer protection are essential conditions for the development of trade over the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the following points. There are a) trade marks that are not really matched to any particular product. For example, you order ‘a Siemens’. ‘A Siemens’ can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station. There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels. There are c) trade marks that require absolute identity, in medicine for example. It cannot be even one milligram different from what the mark designates.</p>
<p class="contents">All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study. Such a study must also draw comparisons with the world’s major trading nations and study and make a precise analysis of the implications for the EU labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position is all the more important and necessary since the report refers to the crucial problems related to globalisation and European integration. In addition to the direct interests of consumers and manufacturers, the economic position of the European Union in world trade is at stake. Some may be in favour of a total liberalisation of trade, whereas others, myself included, believe that the system of Community exhaustion responds to the need to develop the integration of the single market, a favourable way of supporting Europe in the face of global competition. Apart from the concept of integration, the crux of this report is to support innovation, and God knows how much we have spoken about this in the previous report, to support innovation and creativity within the Community. Trade marks are the most important and most efficient way of protecting intellectual property. Trade marks provide the consumer with a guarantee of a product’s authenticity and quality, and they ensure pre-sales, shape investment and, consequently, creation. A change in the system could lead to a drop in investment in research and development of European products and the impact on jobs could be significant. The current system also provides the best means of protection against counterfeiting, as the channels used by parallel importers are often those used to transport pirate products. In the studies that are currently available, and I stress the ‘currently’, we found no relevant information enabling us to justify a change to the system, which could be detrimental to innovation. I hope that the further consideration proposed by Mr Mayer will confirm this opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am perfectly aware that it is not the report he would have liked to approve and, although it is little consolation, I would like to say that I also would have preferred the report finally approved by Parliament to have been the one Mr Mayer initially drew up.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the powerful interests concerned with preventing the world trade in trade mark products, the unusual report by a consulting company which states that consumers would not benefit immediately from the acquisition of goods at lower prices and the lukewarm position of the Commission which does not seem interested in seeking a solution to a problem which has a very negative effect on European consumers, the rapporteur, Mr Mayer, has been able to produce a report urging persistence in the quest for formulae which prevent manufacturers of trade mark products from maintaining excessively high prices on European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in July 1998, the Court of Justice issued the Silhouette judgment, it caused great commotion in countries which recognised the principle of international exhaustion of the trade mark. Either by law, as in Sweden for example, or by jurisprudence, as in my country, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally, the judgment is unassailable from the moment that it states that Article 7 of the Trade Mark Directive, by establishing the principle of Community exhaustion, indirectly establishes the prohibition of international exhaustion. But this is a legalistic interpretation which does not prevent the recognition, as the judgment does, of the harmful effects for consumers of the fact that owners of trade marks can prevent the import of their own products if they originate from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments used by those people who defend the prohibition of the international exhaustion of trade marks – combating counterfeiting, maintaining the prestigious image of goods, diversion of income from the manufacturer to the importer – are at odds with a reality which is demonstrated in the documents produced by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">When parallel imports from third countries are allowed, the prices of trade mark products drop. The information provided on price increases in Germany, when the reform of German law prevented international exhaustion, is conclusive. And although my experience is of little scientific value, I must point out that I have been able to note how, in the United States, a product which in Spain costs me EUR 10, costs me just EUR 1.5.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons and despite the reservations involved in finding a consensus in favour of a more ambitious resolution, it is important that the Commission takes the initiative in favour of consumers and brings forward proposals to strengthen the world market, removing barriers to trade, which are not just customs barriers, but which often consist of anti-competitive practices by companies whose aim is to defend their own profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, however, we have embarked upon a very interesting discussion of trade marks and their significance in terms of dividing up world markets. Those of us who want to see a form of globalisation that is of benefit to all parties look forward to an international exhaustion of trade mark rights in accordance with the original Mayer report. The same applies if one is in favour of an effective competition policy, as mentioned by the rapporteur, for European exhaustion as it is at present enables markets to be divided up, providing benefits to manufacturers but not to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Different studies can produce different results. The Commission takes a relatively negative view of international exhaustion in its study. On the other hand, we also have the experience referred to by the previous speaker whereby there are quite a few countries in which goods became more expensive after Community exhaustion had been introduced, for example Germany, Sweden and Great Britain. I am also sorry that this matter could not have been taken further during the Swedish Presidency which, I know, accorded it a high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we shall now, in fact, produce a report on this subject. I also hope that the Commissioner can tell us what opportunities there are for addressing the issue in the context of the WTO in which a new round of talks is about to start.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important not to confuse this issue with that of pirate manufacturing, which is a completely different matter. There are new ways of checking the authenticity of goods by means of genuine and detailed identification, facilitating a completely new form of supervision. I therefore hope that the Commission is able to support the endeavours representing the main approach taken by Parliament today, as well as by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I was not a member of the committee which produced this report, I want to speak because my colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who was a member, is detained by the grave events now under discussion at our party conference in Brighton.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs. Like Mrs Thors, I was for a time the Chair of the Consumer Protection Intergroup. Parliament's Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did. The substantial majority which Mr Mayer rallied in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, of course, for a response which, as my colleague has said, was less than he would have wished. It is also less than I would have wished and it should be less than this Parliament would have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal recommendation here is for a further study of the consequences of a transition to the use of the principle of international exhaustion. Fine, but how long is that going to take when a parallel importer can be prevented from giving the consumer a quality product at a price which benefits them both? This is not like counterfeit products, as another speaker tried to suggest. It is not competitive selling at a loss to weaken rival products, nor is it driving down the quality of those products. It is a straightforward blockage of trade, which will not diminish the so-called grey markets but will make them more confused and complex.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade. I do not really expect more from the Commissioner tonight than I have heard from him privately. However, the matter cannot rest here. The Silhouette case was not the last word on all this and nor, as he would acknowledge, is Mr Mayer's report. Nevertheless I salute him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, this is an important subject and has been discussed at various places and at various times. It is important that the exhaustion regime for Trade marks which the Community applies provides for a proper balance between the interest of consumer prices and protection of Trade mark rights. It has been stated by those who advocate a change to the Community-wide exhaustion regime, that a unilateral change to international exhaustion of Trade mark rights would have a significant impact on consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not convinced that this would be the case. According to the Nera study carried out by a consultancy firm based in London which was submitted to the Commission in February 1999, prices under international exhaustion would probably not be very different from those that are currently in force. Mr Berenguer Fuster and the rapporteur have referred to alleged price increases in Germany of films, perfume and cameras. As soon as this became known, the sectors concerned supplied statistics to the Commission to show that prices have not increased as was claimed, but have remained the same or in some cases even decreased. The purported evidence concerning Germany is not what it seems to be and, in fact, supports the case that the Commission has put forward and not the case in favour of international exhaustion.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a price study carried out by the Swedish and the UK governments. It is very interesting to note, and significant for this debate, that of the items where comparisons between the European Union and the United States were possible, the cheapest market was often within the European Union. For some products, the United States was even the most expensive market. Moreover, there were considerable price differences between Member States. In general, prices in Germany and France were lower than in the UK and in Sweden. Those differences exist within the European Union where there is regional exhaustion for Trade mark rights and not international exhaustion. In other words, for all Member States of the European Union the same exhaustion regime applies yet there is a 40% price difference in electronic goods between Sweden and Germany. This certainly goes to show that the internal market is not performing as it should be, but it also shows that the differences in prices have nothing to do with whether the exhaustion regime is regional or international.</p>
<p class="contents">The price differences within the European Union usually exceed the price differences between EU Member States and the United States. In other words, the arguments in favour of the thesis that international exhaustion would lead to a decrease in prices is very tenuous. In fact the Commission does not believe that evidence at all. Furthermore, I should like to add that the price element is only one aspect of the exhaustion issue. It is also very important to consider the legitimate interest of Trade mark holders in their home markets. For many companies the Trade mark is their most valuable asset and that is not something we should take lightly. Trade marks are also of value to consumers because they represent a sign of quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided in May 2000 that there is no reason, at least for the time being, to propose any change to the current regime. The Commission considers that there is now a proper balance between the interests at stake and that the current Community-wide exhaustion regime is an appropriate way to protect the legitimate rights of Trade mark holders. The Commission has taken due note, obviously, of Mr Mayer's report and of the long and difficult discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Many arguments have been put forward for and against a change of regime. The Commission recognised all those arguments from previous discussions in other fora.</p>
<p class="contents">All the aspects mentioned have been thoroughly studied and analysed by the Commission services and in my view no new elements have been put forward which would require further examination or which would give the Commission reason to reconsider its decision. Having said this, the Commission intends to monitor the question of exhaustion closely and will certainly take any action necessary should new and important reasons emerge to consider abandoning the current exhaustion regime. In the meantime, the Commission is, of course, willing to share with Parliament our experiences concerning cases of possible abuse of Trade mark rights but in order to make the report more useful and balanced the Commission intends to take all relevant elements into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
