<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, I have no doubt that everyone in this House will join me in expressing condemnation about the verdict against Yulia Tymoshenko pronounced in Ukraine yesterday. I issued a strong statement on behalf of the European Union at that time and I fully share the views that were expressed in President Buzek’s statement at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko was politically motivated. Her conviction yesterday followed a trial which did not respect international standards as regards a fair, transparent and independent legal process. Regrettably, her case is not an isolated one in the Ukraine. Several other members of her government have been prosecuted and convicted in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">These judicial proceedings have been criticised not just by Ukraine’s partners, but by independent monitors and experts. This is not acceptable for a country which holds the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe, or for a country which claims to share our fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">Selective and politically motivated justice is not the European way. Governments are accountable to their electorates and their political decisions should be judged through the ballot box, not through the courts. This principle is a cornerstone of our democracies. There is absolute unity among the Member States of the European Union that the Ukrainian authorities must allow for swift and comprehensive appeals, without limitations to the right to stand in the parliamentary elections next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to see that President Yanukovych has expressed unhappiness with the Criminal Code in Ukraine and recognises the need for change, but frankly, that is not enough. It does not excuse the authorities from the responsibility to guarantee a process which is fully in line with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine also needs to press ahead with critical reforms to the constitution and adopt an electoral law which reflects a cross-party consensus in parliament. A level playing field is essential if we are to see credibility and confidence restored in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2011 was to have been one of unparalleled opportunity and development in EU-Ukraine relations. Our aim was to sign an association agreement, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area, by the end of the year. That agreement has been conceived not as a gift to Ukraine, or a gift to Europe, but as a mutually beneficial contract sharing our values and standards, opening our markets, modernising and diversifying the Ukrainian economy, and entrenching the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. It would have been the first of its kind under the renewed European Neighbourhood Policy and the reinvigorated Eastern Partnership, whose leaders, as honourable Members know, met only 10 days ago in Warsaw and reconfirmed their commitment to closer political association based on these common values.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the offer of concluding an association agreement should remain on the table. Yulia Tymoshenko herself asked us to carry on with the technical work on the association agreement. Both citizens in the European Union and in Ukraine stand to benefit, and it offers the Ukrainian Government the road map for transformation that the country needs. So I believe that we should not walk away from the technical negotiations but continue with the aim of having before us on the table a document which makes it clear to both sides what is possible – and also what could be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">But we can only sign such an agreement if we are convinced that the Ukrainian leadership believes in the values on which it is based, and is committed to upholding. It is clear that this House would not accept such an agreement if it did not have this conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, I will be meeting both President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, and Ukraine is on our agenda. Of course we will review the contacts with Ukraine, including those political dialogues, and continue to send the clear messages to the leadership on the systemic problem they need to face in re-establishing the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As friends of the Ukrainian people, we owe it to them to spare no effort to help Ukrainian leaders take the right decisions. It is clear to us what they are and I believe it is also clear to the people of Ukraine what they are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sentencing of former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, must be condemned. Her trial is politically motivated and did not meet even minimal European standards. Ukraine’s European aspirations require that it practise European values of democracy and the rule of law. That is not currently what is happening there.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Ukraine Government continues on its path of sabotaging political opposition and abusing power, it will put the country’s economic and European prospects at risk. Yulia Tymoshenko should be acquitted and released, and should enjoy full political and civic rights as of now. The verdict, if it is not annulled, will have consequences for the implementation of the EU-Ukraine stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement should be completed and the document should be initialled as planned under the Polish Presidency in December. Subsequently, its signature and ratification could be declined if no changes take place in Ukraine. Ukraine will thus be made aware of what it might lose. More importantly, however, the Union will, at the same time, be sending a positive signal to Ukraine as a nation and to its people who have legitimate European aspirations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ukraine needs to be conscious of the direction in which it wants to go. If it wants to take the path towards Europe, then there are certain preconditions attached to this – namely, acceptance of the principles of our system of law and the implementation of these.</p>
<p class="contents">My group rejects any kind of criminal trial or legal proceedings that would appear to be based on political persecution. If attempts are made to prosecute Mr Gyurcsány in Hungary, then we suspect that things are happening there that are not entirely in accordance with our legal standards. If we criticise that, then we cannot accept what is currently happening in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a common legal position which sets out that trials must take place according to proper European principles and not as an act of revenge by a government. Everyone in this House knows that we are trying to maintain good working relationships, particularly with the Ukrainian Party of Regions, and that we are giving very strong support to Ukraine’s efforts to take a European path. We will do everything possible to ensure that this can be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski that we should continue the negotiations. However, our group will send a clear signal to Kiev that this is not the way to put the relationship between the European Union and Ukraine on a better footing and move it to a higher level. This voice must be heard loud and clear, and as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we will do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has a lot to work on in its relationship with the countries south of the Mediterranean. For far too long, dictators have been respected by us and given our unconditional cooperation. However, we should assess what we are currently doing in respect of Ukraine in the light of this responsibility and the negative experience that Arab peoples have had of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am emphatically in favour of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine – and I say that on behalf of my group. This agreement could really serve to put our social and economic relations on a more stable footing and improve the lives of the people of Ukraine. I am firmly convinced that the people of Ukraine have really fought for and deserve this association agreement through their commitment to democratic development. It is extremely regrettable that the case of Yulia Tymoshenko is now putting pressure on relations between the European Union and Ukraine – which had, in fact, improved. However, that is the way it has to be, for the reasons agreed on by all the previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to go beyond this, however, and point out that it is not just Ms Tymoshenko who faces court proceedings, but also some of the members of her former government. I would like to point out that before these proceedings were initiated, hundreds of judges and public prosecutors in Ukraine were replaced. That is not what I understand by democratic reform of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that Ukraine still does not have a truly good and independent media sector, and that it is very difficult to guarantee diversity of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of all this that we have to take a tough line now. Yes, we will continue to negotiate, but we will also make it clear that our signing of the agreement – the European Union’s approval of the association agreement – in fact depends on democratic developments in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Tymoshenko belongs to the family of Christian democratic parties in Europe. With his Party of Regions, President Yanukovych has observer status among the social democrats in Europe. I feel that both party families have a great responsibility to now ensure that relations between government and opposition forces are based on democratic principles. As far as I am concerned, bringing this about is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There may indeed be various grounds for condemning Ms Tymoshenko, but does she really deserve to go to prison? She has not been convicted of corruption, for example; instead, she has been convicted on account of the content of the gas deal, which is allegedly disadvantageous for Ukraine. It is precisely for this reason that her politically motivated sentence is incompatible with our legal principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The sentence passed against Ms Tymoshenko is all too clearly a blow intended to annihilate her politically and a pretext for the termination of the gas contract. President Yanukovych may have excluded a political opponent as a result, but he has certainly done his country a disservice. Firstly, the sentence is clearly seen by Moscow as being anti-Russian – that is clear – and, because of its dependence on gas, Kiev has no choice but to come to an arrangement with Russia. Secondly, Ukraine must be aware that the sentence will put negotiations with the EU under strain.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU therefore needs to consider carefully whether the association agreement really has to be put on ice as a protest; if so, we have to accept that this would be a setback for the Eastern Partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ms Tymoshenko must therefore be released immediately. The members of our group who have been encouraging this country to adopt a European perspective, and who even did not rule out membership in the long term, are particularly appalled.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who currently hold political power in Kiev and the people behind them evidently do not share our European values. Applying criminal sanctions to political decisions with the aim of destroying the opposition is not acceptable. Ms Tymoshenko could also have taken legal proceedings against President Yanukovych back in 2004 for electoral fraud. She did not do so; instead, she engaged with him politically.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso should adopt a clear position when dealing with President Yanukovych next week. We cannot sign an agreement with a partner when the text of the agreement departs so blatantly from the reality in that country. This is the reality today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to suppose at present that those in power in Kiev, and the Firtashs and Khoroshkovskys of that country, will be bothered in the future by the detailed rules of the association and free trade agreement. They will continue to instigate arbitrary court proceedings, to use the country’s institutions for partisan and oligarchical purposes, and to place obstacles in the way of our investors, so that they can control things within their own circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless Kiev takes specific steps by next week to bring about a European standard of rule of law, then President Barroso should consider whether he actually has enough to talk about with President Yanukovych.

A situation in which everyone has their own firmly held views on which they are unwilling to compromise? For the Ukrainian authorities are correct to some extent when they say they are fighting corruption and that they suspect their former prime minister, the opposition leader, of committing serious corruption offences. We, however, are also correct in saying that it is completely unacceptable to imprison the leader of the opposition and seven of her former ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">While we all stand firmly by our reasons, the momentous historical process of bringing Ukraine closer to the European Union through the association agreement is being pushed aside. It is my opinion that in this difficult situation, which seems to be lacking any agreement, we should persist in our efforts. The EU should not be an institution which closes its doors. I therefore believe that it is all the more sensible and necessary to receive and speak with President Yanukovych in Brussels, and to inform him of all the reasons behind our position.</p>
<p class="contents">If, at the end of this process, the association agreement is not signed for some reason, then the greatest winner and the person most satisfied with such an outcome would be the one sitting in the Kremlin, since in this case, the true victor would be the Russian national interest.

A discussion was being held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the Ukrainian minister, Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, who was trying to persuade the members of the Committee that the Ukrainian judiciary is independent, just at the time when the news broke that former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, had been sentenced to seven years in prison. This is a slightly surreal situation, only serving to remind us of the type of trial and holding to account practised in the time of Stalin. In fact, quite a few commentators have described Yulia Tymoshenko’s trial as Stalinist.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if things stay as they are, I wonder why we need to continue doing what we have been doing for a good few months. We said what we are saying today at the time of Yulia Tymoshenko’s arrest. Yanukovych was not at all receptive to this message. Therefore, why should we raise the issue of continuing negotiations for an association agreement when one of the partners involved is actually a Stalinist?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the association agreement negotiations must be stopped. Only a very clear political message like this can make Yanukovych understand our position. The reason for this is that, otherwise, if we continue to have these discussions and say: ‘let us meet Yanukovych and explain it to him once again’, I am afraid that he will hoodwink us just like Stalin hoodwinked some of the Western politicians for absolutely years on end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It casts a shadow on all efforts made by the current government to bring the country closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The seven-year prison sentence for Ms Tymoshenko rightly provoked an outrage throughout the EU and its Member States. However, against the political correctness, I want to be honest in this debate, and I am speaking on my own behalf here.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the sentencing of Ms Tymoshenko really political revenge, or was it really an end to impunity in Ukraine? Was the sentence of seven years a shocking abuse of the law, or can we simply not imagine the scale of the abuse of power and the damage to the country? When we call for a fair and objective trial, do we really mean that, or do we mean ‘release Tymoshenko’? For me, the answers to these questions are not self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us put aside the emotions, let us not be too quick in rejecting the EU aspirations of the Ukraine. Let us help both the government and Ms Tymoshenko find a solution so that the rule of law is preserved but the political process and the next elections are not called into question.

The Helsinki Committee has, on a number of occasions, raised the alarm with respect to violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ukraine, as a member of the Council of Europe, should conform unconditionally.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of transparency in the Ukrainian legal system has led to the politically motivated verdict against Yulia Tymoshenko. This casts a shadow on the future process of EU-Ukraine integration. Ukraine’s policy is lacking in credibility, and if this does not change, our future talks will be put at risk. Calls to that effect have already been voiced by many concerned representatives of the EU, including members of this House. I would like to recall the European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2011, which, in recital A, states that the EU favours a stable and democratic Ukraine that respects the principles of the rule of law, the protection of minorities and human rights, and that guarantees fundamental rights as well as fair, impartial and independent legal processes.

Ukraine has demonstrated on several occasions recently that it is not only lacking as regards its judicial system, but also in the area of human rights, as persons belonging to minorities, who are neither former Heads of State nor prime ministers, but ordinary Ukrainian citizens, have been deprived of their right to use their native language in education and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Where I do advise my fellow Members to draw parallels is that the EU can only take effective and credible action against Ukraine if, within its own area, within the area of the European Union, Member States abolish anti-minority laws that prejudice collective rights, and if they do away with provisions in the form of language laws and other discriminative legal acts that punish EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The critical thing for Ukraine now is to take seriously the need to move on what we have been saying about the need for a fair, transparent and independent legal process. That, I would argue, is the core of this debate. Commentators among Ukraine’s partners and in independent bodies have made clear that this process did not live up to international standards. That is the basis upon which we need to move forward, and the Ukrainians need to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will see a swift appeals process that will enable that to be the basis upon which decisions are made by the courts. The honourable Members have made very eloquent statements. I will just echo one, which is that we know that it is in the interests of the people of Ukraine to move forward with an association agreement with us and to take forward the values which we hold dear and which the members of the Ukrainian Government claim to wish to see as well. I believe that they should reflect carefully on the very eloquent words of this Parliament tonight, and I look forward to their reacting positively to your comments and to mine.</p>

Despite the fact that the other opposition leader committed grave errors impacting the Ukrainian economy, the EU must be prepared to provide assistance and take steps to help modernise the legal system and strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine. There have also been doubts as to the transparency and impartiality of this trial. We in the European Parliament must not treat the situation in Ukraine lightly – and nor are we treating it lightly in fact. Just as it is important to make an effort to avoid the occurrence of similar situations in the future, it is also important to ensure a fair judicial process with a modernised and impartial judiciary, and not a process marred by political interference. It is vital to cooperate in creating the conditions for strengthening Ukraine’s European integration process on the basis of shared values, respect for the law and the application of European democratic standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and understand that disparities exist between the legal systems in various countries. At the same time, it is difficult to comprehend and accept the verdict against the former prime minister. One of our Lithuanian colleagues stated that if purchasing Russian natural gas at excessive prices was a punishable offence, then a number of former Lithuanian prime ministers should be imprisoned. Concerns as to the political motives behind the verdict are widespread in Europe. I therefore call on the Ukrainian authorities to consider all potential solutions which might provide a way out of a situation that is embarrassing for all involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with what the High Representative and some of the previous speakers said in their speeches and see a clear political motive behind the sentence. The European Union must now ask itself to what extent such action can promote relations between the EU and Ukraine. If Ukraine continues down the road on which it has embarked and turns its back on the values and principles of a common Europe, this will not help to bring the two parties closer together. The position of the EU on this is, and must be, clear. The events surrounding Yulia Tymoshenko will certainly influence the negotiations regarding an association agreement and a trade agreement, there is no doubt about that. However, we should not go so far as to declare the negotiations terminated before they have begun. That would be the wrong signal to send out. I agree with the approach advocated by Mr Saryusz-Wolski of continuing the negotiations to their conclusion. Ratification could then wait. One of the basic principles of the EU is respect for the rule of law. We must defend this without any ifs and buts and also demand it from our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must send a strong, well-coordinated message to the Ukrainian authorities concerning respect for the separation of state powers. The current climate in Kiev may have serious repercussions on relations between the EU and Ukraine, looking ahead to the signing of an association agreement. It is important that the government in Kiev commits to a process of transition to democracy and, by extension, to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that Yulia Tymoshenko’s situation is not an isolated case. The ever-growing number of investigations being carried out into prominent political leaders, members of Ukraine’s political opposition, casts serious doubts over the impartiality of these inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">These examples from Ukraine, a European state, are occurring in the year 2011 when the states of North Africa are taking important steps towards democracy. As Europe’s guarantor of democratic principles and values, the EU cannot and must not stand idly by when politics interferes with the administration of justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
