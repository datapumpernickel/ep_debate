<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paolo Costa (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I have the honour of chairing, is following the process of achieving a trans-European transport network (TEN-T), as set out in the guidelines codecided by the Council and Parliament in April 2004, with much attention and with some concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns stem from the discovery of significant delays in the execution of constituent projects of the first definition of the TEN-T – codecided in 1996 – and from the identification of insufficient funding as the principal cause of those delays. Decision No 884/2004, which amended the definition of the TEN-T in the Union of 25, anticipates large-scale financial requirements: at least EUR 225 billion for the 30 projects from now until 2020, of which at least EUR 140 billion is to be spent in the period incorporated within the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the strategic value of creating the trans-European network, it would appear crucial that funding for these requirements should be guaranteed straight away, if possible even prior to the definition of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, in order to prevent unbearable frustrations for the Union and Member States in coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strategic for the internal and external competitiveness of the economy of a Union that must fully exploit the benefits of the single market. Such benefits will be illusory if a product manufactured in Lisbon or Dublin cannot compete with similar products manufactured in Warsaw or Budapest because of differentials in transport costs. It is strategic for the sustainability of European transport, since the priority projects chiefly concern rail, marine and river transport. Lastly, it is strategic for the genuine integration of European society: social and cultural integration that is neither forced nor impeded, but which requires effective links between every Member State of the Union to allow communication, exchange, recognition and appreciation of identity and diversity to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I hope, the Commission and the Council confirm their awareness of the strategic value of the TEN-T here today, the assurances required by Parliament as a consequence concern, firstly, whether the appropriation for Community cofinancing of the entire network will be sufficient for all of the 30 projects to be carried out by 2020; and, secondly, when and where it will be appropriate for Community cofinancing to be used, so as to back up the far more extensive funding provided by the Member States as well as, where possible, the contributions made by private individuals in private/public partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Community rules and decisions to facilitate all of this – from the Eurovignette directive to the creation of a special fund of loan indemnities – are necessary additions. It is in that context and in view of the EUR 20.3 billion proposed for the TEN-T by the Commission under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective – a budget that would guarantee that an average 15% of the funding of the trans-European transport network is met – that the Committee, through me, would like to learn from the Council whether it considers that sum adequate to cover the amount of Community cofinancing that is necessary and sufficient for all 30 projects. In other words, can the Council guarantee that the Member States will be able to finance the remaining 85% on average of the estimated funding from their own public or private resources, or ought we not to consider increasing the Community share?</p>
<p class="contents">We address the same question to the Commission, and call on it, moreover, to disclose the time frame for the take-up of Community funding by the various projects, which means knowing their stage of progress, administratively and technically, both now and in the future. We also ask how it intends to distribute the available budget in time and space.</p>
<p class="contents">The next question is addressed to both the Council and the Commission and includes a proposal or explicit recommendation: is it not advisable to concentrate Community cofinancing as a priority, if not exclusively, on the 48 cross-border sections of the 30 projects: those that straddle two Member States, which in many cases do not get off the ground as a result of conflicts of competences or interest? This would have many positive effects: by limiting funding just to the 48 cross-border sections, it would put us in a position to make the idea of a 30-50% level of cofinancing a feasible one and ensure that those sections were constructed promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">If Community cofinancing were made conditional and the endorsement of international bilateral treaties were required, the Member States would be forced to clearly accept their responsibility even for internal sections. By ensuring that cross-border sections would be completed, stumbling blocks would turn into incentives. To give an example that I know first-hand, how could the internal section between Turin and Trieste not be completed if the Union guaranteed the completion in a set time of the Fréjus Tunnel between Turin and Lyon on the French side, and the Trieste-Divača stretch on the Italian-Slovenian side?</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope that this recommendation will be accepted and incorporated by the Council and the Commission, I will conclude with the request, addressed to the Commission, that it should specify the 48 cross-border sections clearly and precisely. Commissioner, Minister, I confidently await your replies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree, in fact, with his analysis of the importance of the trans-European networks, which is evident in many respects: these trans-European networks are first and foremost part of a growth initiative that has been relaunched by the European Council; they contribute, or must also contribute, to the objective of competitiveness as defined at the March European Council; they represent, moreover, an essential element of the smooth functioning of the internal market; and, above all, they are indispensable for guaranteeing the territorial cohesion of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Delays have in fact occurred and that is all the more regrettable given that a number of projects were decided on within the context of a quick-start programme. A priori, these projects had to be launched quickly. It is precisely on these issues and on the reasons for the delays that a high-level group on the trans-European transport networks, led by Mr Karel van Miert, has carried out its studies, in particular regarding the delays occurring in the cross-border sections. To alleviate these delays, the Council adopted Regulation No 807/2004, in April 2004, which specifically aims to increase the proportion of Community financing of certain projects. The clear objective of the Regulation is to guarantee adequate cofinancing for the projects in question; implementing this Regulation falls within the competence of the Commission and I am sure that the Vice-President will provide you with explanations in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 July 2004, the Council received a new proposal for a regulation on this matter. This proposal aims to improve the financing of trans-European transport and energy networks for the 2007-2013 period. The competent working group of the Council examined the text only once. Given the significant financial implications of this proposal, several delegations wished to wait for the conclusion of the discussion on the financial perspectives before taking a definitive decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am able to state, on behalf of the Presidency, that the implementation of this programme and of these projects is of the utmost importance for the reasons we have outlined. In order to accomplish these projects, sufficient means are indeed necessary. The Presidency therefore believes that the budget proposed by the Commission appears adequate and sufficient. The Council is also busy examining a communication from the Commission regarding the possibility of introducing a Community loan guarantee instrument for loans granted to trans-European transport network projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we will only succeed in implementing this series of projects if we are also able to create innovative financing methods. You have suggested a number of them, particularly a better division between private and public funding. I am sure that, on the basis of these different elements, we will manage to launch these projects as soon as possible, since that is also an important factor within the context of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to thank the European Parliament for raising this question today because it allows me to draw attention once again, Minister, to the fact that trans-European transport networks are the key to the Lisbon strategy and to growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As you yourself said, Mr Schmit, territorial cohesion is vital for the enlarged Europe. You also referred to the Lisbon strategy’s goal of competitiveness. I am among those who believe that mobility is now an integral part of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Before answering the questions raised by Mr Costa, the Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would also like to mention a few figures confirming the importance of these networks. The time lost in congestion in Europe has been put at 1% of gross domestic product or more than EUR 100 billion; that is almost as much as the European Union budget. The Commission’s 2003 impact assessment concluded that construction of the large trans-European network projects could generate extra economic growth of around 0.25% of GDP, that is one million permanent highly skilled jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Costa referred to the delays in carrying out the Essen projects. The main reason for this has been the inadequacy of Community aid. That aid has not in fact always been enough to persuade investors to mobilise and to coordinate their efforts, especially for transnational links. It is quite clear that these projects will not come about without an EU financial effort, which will take the form of this reasonable and much thought-over increase in the Community budget for trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I would like briefly to discuss three questions. The first concerns the van Miert Group’s estimate for all 30 priority projects at EUR 225 billion for the period from 2003 to 2020. Following a survey of the Member States, the Commission has established the finance needed for each project up until 2020. Adding those requirements together gives an investment profile showing that, for the period 2007-2013, the need for funding will peak half way through the new period of financial perspectives. This profile suggests that the investment needs will be of the order of EUR 140 billion for the period 2007-2013 and that there will be a considerable increase between 2007, with EUR 17 billion, and 2010, with EUR 25 billion, especially as large projects, like the Brenner and Mont Cenis Alpine crossings, which will absorb very large amounts of money, take off.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 20 000 300 000 budget proposed by the Commission is a minimum. In fact, if I confine myself to the sections of priority projects that are ready for starting today, I can tell this House, Mr President, that the entire average annual budget proposed by the Commission for 2007–2013 would already be taken up. The requests for funding that the Commission received from the Member States in 2003 and 2004 are already enough for spending three or four times the present budget. I am saying this to the Luxembourg Presidency because we really must have these figures clearly in our minds in order to understand that this money will be used immediately, in the best of conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these priority projects, we will have to cofinance the rest of the network, in particular such technology projects as the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) or the Sesame air traffic control initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">All this shows quite clearly, honourable Members, how important it is to maintain at least the proposed EUR 20 000 300 000 budget. This money really can be used as soon as the European Union has access to it. That is my first answer.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now answer the second question. The budget breakdown will, first of all, be based on an indicative multiannual programme for 2007–2013, which will set out the amounts allocated to each project in each period. Obviously, these allocations will depend on the actual progress made with the projects. This programme should be settled in the course of 2006. Secondly, part of the budget will be distributed on the basis of annual calls for proposals. Projects will be selected on the basis of how well the project has been prepared for, the soundness of the financial package and the consequences for the environment. The Commission will be particularly keen to obtain firm commitments from the Member States in order to ensure that the priority projects go as planned. That is my answer to the second question.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the third question which Mr Costa rightly stressed, I would like to confirm that the 48 cross-border sections of the 30 priority projects to which you refer are and will continue to be considered priorities in the allocation of funds, provided that those cross-border sections satisfy the preparation and maturity criteria I have just mentioned. For potentially eligible cross-border sections, please note this is not a general scale, but some cross-border sections could be eligible for as much as 50% if the Commission’s proposal is accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">To be eligible for such a rate, projects will have to satisfy the following criteria: first, they will have to require action, construction works, on both sides of the border between two Member States. Secondly, the project will have to be technically and financially indivisible. Lastly, the Member States concerned will have to be committed to the project jointly and set up a common structure. I am personally very much in favour of giving such priority to cross-border sections. I can assure Mr Costa that we do have the list of these projects, these 48 sections.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now drawing to a conclusion, Mr President, honourable Members. I know you are already convinced of the necessity of the European Union having an effective and efficient trans-European transport network. Did you not adopt the 30 priority projects here in this House in April 2004? Clearly, Minister, the future financial perspectives for 2007–2013 will have to allow those perspectives that Parliament has so wisely described to be translated into reality. I want to be clear on this question. Either this House and the Council of Ministers will grant the necessary budget for the 30 priority projects and we will then, I am sure – and I will do my level best to see that it happens – succeed in putting these 30 priority projects in place. Or – and I do not believe this will happen – your decision will remain a dead letter and then it will only be possible to cofinance a relatively modest part of those projects</p>
<p class="contents">Changing the subject, I see, Mr President, that I must take this opportunity to thank the Luxembourg Presidency because we have completed the first stage in establishing the Eurovignette. I would like to draw attention to all that the Luxembourg Presidency has done to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that, together with my fellow-Commissioner Mr Almunia, we have created this guarantee tool, which, as you said just now, will make it possible to use public-private partnerships in just a few cases. To be honest, however, without these EUR 20 000 300 000 it will be extremely difficult for us to rise to this challenge. I therefore thank Parliament once again for raising this important question today. Even if it anticipates the major debates on the financial perspectives, it is sometimes good, honourable Members, to remember that there are a number of imperatives we cannot avoid. When you believe deeply in the success of Europe, in the success of this territorial cohesion we all want, in the success, too, of a more competitive Europe, quite honestly I believe we must give the necessary priority to our trans-European networks, as Parliament has wisely described them, which in all honesty I believe are essential if Europe is to succeed in the years ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">I am aware that our sectoral interests are not the only ones threatened by the restriction of resources apparently approaching, but, in any event, they fall within this Parliament's responsibilities. </p>
<p class="contents">The delay in compliance with the commitments made in 1996 by means of codecision between Parliament and the Council, with regard to the funding of the trans-European transport networks, is a fact. It is not merely an opinion. The Commission's proposal of a sum of EUR 20 300 million for this objective, within the framework of the financial perspectives 2007-2013, is also a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is being asked whether there is sufficient funding to meet the commitments laid down in Decision 884/2004. We respect the opinion of the Council, as expressed by Mr Schmit, who describes it, at least, as appropriate and sufficient. Well, we are asking questions because we truly believe that extremely important projects are genuinely at risk of coming to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission has highlighted serious concerns, which deserve to be reproduced in their entirety. The Commission says: ‘the worst delays concern rail projects and cross-frontier links which limit the possibilities created by the opening of the railway market. They have in fact become one of the principle sources of congestion and imbalance between modes of transport on the major routes’. </p>
<p class="contents">At the current pace of investment, it would take more than 20 years to complete the whole of the trans-European transport network in accordance with the 2004 review. So the conclusion is very clear; Mr Barrot has demonstrated his ambition and the Council has told us that this budget is sufficient, but we believe that if it is not supplemented in this way, the great projects which peripheral countries such as Spain are hoping for will be frustrated. We trust in the efficiency of the work of the Commission and the Council, with the contribution of this Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for this reason that we are running the risk, where the trans-European networks are concerned, of making permanent the trans-European nuisance that we have had for some years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that building the trans-European networks is a task given us by the Treaty of Maastricht. They are not something that we simply came up with; they are a matter of obligation, an obligation into which we jointly entered. Throughout the time that I have been working on them – starting with the Christopherson group, and most recently in the high-level representatives’ group under Karel Van Miert – the outcome has always been a great deal of hot air, but little of any real substance, and little in the way of projects. Even in the days of the Christophersen group, we were told that the projects were all ready to go ahead, that they were a practical proposition, and that the excavators could start work tomorrow. Not much actually happened, though.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that last year, in May 2004, the Council and this House specified completion dates for the projects. If it turns out that these completion dates cannot be met, I would hope that the Council – and by that I mean not the Council as a whole, but the Member States – will say that that is not what they want, that they cannot go along with it, and that the projects cannot be completed. It is at that point that we will have to abandon the projects. So, in this matter, let us have more courage, more commitment and more honesty from the Council, and if what we have heard today – that the presidency, Parliament, and the Commission endorse the budget appropriations for the Financial Perspective – is a promise, then that is a statement with which we are very comfortable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, in Europe, what belongs together can grow together, and the TEN projects help to bring this about, but we also know that the 30 TEN projects are a wish-list drawn up in a spirit of national ambition. The bridge over the Straits of Messina has nothing to do with European integration, but it is on the list.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that funding all 30 projects, which are due to be completed by 2020, will call for some EUR 600 billion. We also know, though, that, if we presuppose a 20% share, the EU, under the present financial plan, will take 120 years to do that. We do not have that much time. Yes, it is a good thing that the Council has agreed on a Euro-vignette, but we know that the amount levied will not be enough to fund, for example, the tunnel through the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy. On the basis of the tolls that Austria collects, it would take 300 years for Austria to be able to fund its share of the Brenner tunnel. That is why we need priorities; what we need is the sort of transport projects that will unite Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This has prompted us to start an initiative transcending party and national boundaries. We want absolute priority to be given to the joining-up of the European rail links between Berlin, Warsaw, Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, and we want a rail link between Vienna and Venice to Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest. If we complete these two projects, we will have reached all eight capitals of the new Member States, and Europe will then be able to grow together. In any case, we would rather see these two projects fully realised by 2010 than have 30, 50 or 48 projects half-finished in 2020. European integration is dependent on our setting priorities in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this capacity I can clearly state that under no circumstances should the EUR 20.3 billion currently being proposed by the draft regulation be reduced. It is imperative that this level of funding be viewed as an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to give an assurance that this proposed level of funding will meet the needs created by the higher levels of Community cofinancing, which can be as high as 50%. We need to be realistic in order to meet the objective of advancing these projects, particularly when the number of priority projects has increased from 14 to 30. Undoubtedly there is a high level of expectation on the ground for clearer rules on the granting of aid to TEN-T projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential. Member States need to stand up and take responsibility for their respective infrastructures. European funding alone cannot achieve this for them. Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross-border projects, but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Where proper parallel funding has not been made available by a Member State, the Commission’s inspection role and its ability to recover funds need to be strengthened. The Commission, after all, is the custodian of the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I understand it, three things are needed before the trans-European transport network can be established, namely money, money and more money. In my opinion, however, money is not all that is needed. Once upon a time all roads led to Rome, the centre of the civilised world, because that was how the Romans built them. Where do the roads of the ever more united Europe now lead? It is not my intention to answer that question just now. Instead, I should like to address another question that lies behind it. Does the transport system of the enlarged EU, which in future will enlarge even further, really form one system, and can the European network be viewed as a whole? In my opinion, the answer to this must be no. Sixteen new priority projects have been added to what was until recently 14, in order to take account of the accession of the new EU Member States. The action we take in future will undoubtedly also follow this pattern, or in other words we will continue adding on extra projects in a piecemeal fashion whenever new countries join, as though we were extending a house or making a patchwork quilt.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is not finally time to take a bird’s eye view of Europe, and whether it would not be worth drawing up a comprehensive study of the trans-European transport network. This study should cover not only the Balkan states, but also Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and probably also Russia. In my opinion, it is high time that a comprehensive and methodical study of this kind be drawn up in order to gain a bird’s eye view of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament has always supported the trans-European networks and their sufficient funding and, in fact, it views the proposed 20 300 million for the financial perspectives as a minimum and condemns the delays and obstacles, because they are delays and obstacles to promoting growth and employment and social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that special attention is being paid to cross-border routes and I would like to ask the Commission whether it has examined whether the sum — of 20 300 million — will be sufficient in the ideal event that, for at least half of the cross-border projects, the possible 50% is invested up until 2013. Will that sum also be sufficient to ensure the operation of the guarantee instruments which are being established jointly by Commissioner Barrot and Commissioner Almunia?</p>
<p class="contents">I would want assurance that the Commission and the Council intend to concentrate on the 30 projects already adopted, guaranteeing their stability and providing them with the necessary impetus, and not to be diverted by other interests which, in the form of alternative projects, are appearing as a result of the prospect of fresh money.</p>

It is, however, abundantly clear that this list still contains too many projects in relation to the EU’s financial resources. In view of the recent enlargement and the massive delays being experienced by the new Member States with regard to infrastructure development, I therefore believe that projects aimed at unifying Europe’s transport network should be the focus of particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commission’s proposals for levels of funding under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, it should be noted that there is no justification whatsoever for citing EU enlargement as the reason for increased expenditure in this area. The new Member States are involved in only 10 of the 30 approved projects, and they receive only 10% of funding. Furthermore, the 10 new Member States regard this as an unattractive funding option because of the unusually low rate of cofinancing from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these shortcomings, however, I believe that we should do everything in our power to ensure that expenditure on the trans-European transport network remains at the level proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must perhaps offset the pessimism and negative analysis expressed in certain quarters, since if it is true that progress in the achievement of these projects has up to now, since the Maastricht Treaty, been insufficient, a number of them have nevertheless been carried out or are on course to be carried out since the 1994 European Council in Essen, if my memory serves me well. A first step in completing the projects has thus been achieved or is on course to be.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the Council shares the concerns of your Parliament when you state that the trans-European networks are an essential element from an economic point of view, or from the point of view of territorial cohesion as the speakers have said, and as Mr Vice-President has noted. Certainly, as someone pointed out, money provides the backbone for this effort. We must therefore ensure that our political priorities can also be translated into budgetary priorities. It is in this respect that the financial perspectives are indeed a major issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As President-in-Office of the Council, I can but state that until June, the Luxembourg Presidency attaches great importance to this section of the financial perspectives and would not wish it to be reduced, because that would mean that the political priority would be decreased or further delayed. It is a commitment that the Presidency alone cannot, however, make. It is, in actual fact, the responsibility of the Member States first and foremost and of your Parliament to decide upon them, since the financial perspectives are not only decided upon in the Council. The financial perspectives are decided upon jointly by the Council and by your Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if you attach great political importance to the trans-European networks, you should let it be known. You have done that today, the lesson has been learnt, and the message will be conveyed during the coming weeks, whilst discussions on the financial perspectives will certainly intensify. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should next like to point out that we have a practically complete outline for 27 current and future Member States, and that the proportion of cofinancing will be the same for all Member States. Broadly speaking, we will finance 50% of the studies – as we are doing at present. With regard to the projects, we will increase from a rate of 10% for the ‘normal’ projects to possibly 30% if they are priority projects. The cross-border projects, which until now have benefited from a maximum rate of 20%, could possibly benefit from a rate of 50% if we join you in treating them as a major priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, moreover, like to return to the issue of neighbourhood and the links you hope to foster with the entire European continent. You are aware that I confided my thoughts on extending the trans-European network to neighbouring countries – the Balkans, the Caucasus, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, the Eastern and Southern Mediterranean – to Loyola de Palacio. I am expecting great things of this work, which will enable us to reflect on the future of relations across the European continent and that will also contribute to our thoughts on the neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that we will have to be very attentive, because we will still have to make sure that the nation states and the Member States can undertake the projects in earnest. Overall, we will provide a seventh of the effort, a contribution that will have a fundamental lever effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go over all of the speeches that have been made, particularly by members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. That said, you are right that it is a matter of great urgency, particularly if we hope to avoid, as certain among you fear, the creation of a kind of patchwork made up of small sections that could be managed well, but that would not be linked to the entire network. It is for that reason, Mr President – and I take the liberty of insisting on this point this morning – that I have taken the decision to propose the appointment of coordinators to the Council and Parliament. These coordinators will be made responsible precisely for ensuring that every effort is made along the whole length of the corridor – they are essentially rail corridors and also river corridors – to guarantee the cohesion of the corridor, within the time allowed. I believe, Mr President, that Parliament must promptly issue its opinion on the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that I look forward to Parliament’s opinion? I will then be able to communicate to the Council this proposal on the strategy – if I can use the term – of coordinators, to which, Minister, it has moreover given its consent. Armed with the opinion of Parliament and that of the Council, I would then have to present the nomination of these coordinators that I sincerely hope for to the College of the Commission. The coordinators would in fact have both technical skills and, I believe, the necessary political and moral authority to truly get everybody moving and, if need be, to make sure that two neighbouring States can commit to the project of extending the network by means of bilateral relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank Parliament and the Presidency, which has pointed out that everything has of course been put on hold due to the financial negotiations. That said, I believe that it is also the responsibility of Members to point out to their leaders and to the leaders of their Member States that, if we want a fully competitive Europe that achieves territorial cohesion, they too must play their part in implementing these large-scale projects that can prove a real opportunity for the future of Europe. My thanks also go to Mr Costa who, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, took the initiative for this debate that I too have found very useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
