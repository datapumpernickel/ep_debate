<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Knörr Borràs (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing here today a subject of an extremely technical nature, of the type which, at first sight, appears to refer purely to issues involving the adoption and transposal of procedures and terminology within the European Union, which is the political framework to which they are to be adapted, as is the case with certain instruments in the statistical field.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware, or at least I think we are, that it is important that statistical data is not only reliable, that is, obtained scientifically and rigorously, but also, above all, comparable. This is particularly true with regard to the shaping of the European single market, a context in which we require statistical data which is comparable and equivalent between the different Member States. I would even go so far as to say that this is even truer, if that is possible, in view of the enlargement of the European Union, a process in which the availability and comparability of information, particularly statistical and economic information, must be treated as absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to dwell on the qualities of ESA 95 – the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts – nor on the progress which it represented in relation to the previous 1979 system, an issue which I spoke about in the House at the time of my report on the proposed Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure. What should really be underlined is that, in my view, we must firmly support a Commission proposal which, essentially with regard to an issue as serious as the budgets of the Member States, is inclined to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than criteria such as the amounts due in the field of taxes and social contributions. It is common knowledge, or should be common knowledge, that there are occasions when administrations may record, as due, amounts which they will never collect, however many analyses of collectability are made, and this therefore leads to what is tantamount to a concealed falsification of the public deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a serious issue which has been debated. We should remember that in the Parliament of a Member State there was also a great argument between one of the candidates for the presidency and his opponent, and current President, in which the candidate, Mr Borrell, rightly condemned widespread use of the criterion of income which, since it had not been duly corrected, in reality amounted to a concealment of the deficit in the public accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Ending this type of practice requires clear principles, as the Commission proposes, which in addition allow, very correctly in my judgement, for the calculation of income with the option of using amounts collected or the amounts recorded in a tax document.</p>
<p class="contents">This course of action by the Commission, which some people attack because in short they believe it does not once and for all end the practices of concealing deficit, in no way intends to distort the assessment of the amounts in the national accounts but, on the contrary, to arrive at the same figure in two different ways. One, in my view the more correct way, or at least the more academic way, is the criterion of income, with the corresponding provision concerning collectability, set out in paragraph (a) of Article 3 proposed by the Commission, and the other, set out in paragraph (b) of Article 3, is the criterion of cash receipts adjusted to take account of the time difference between the activity and the cash tax receipt at the end of the financial year. Both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure, which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year. I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget. On the other hand, it is obvious that the option to use either of the two methods offers the advantage of a speedier adaptation on the part of those who choose one or other of the systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I consider that the Commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and, from every point of view, is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately. Nevertheless, we believe that, in order to encourage Member States to gather statistical data, even aggregated data, concerning taxes on products, Article 3 of the Commission proposal should deal with this issue by establishing a similar mechanism for recording and adjusting such taxation. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore take a favourable view of the proposal and I congratulate the Commission. I would like to repeat that the proposal rightly stresses that we should give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the taxes and social contributions due in the Member States, and allows these two methods of calculation, which make it possible for the systems used by the Member States to be adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">A study of the Commission proposal shows that the treatment of taxes and social contributions should indeed follow the two proposed methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to stress that, consistent with our opinion that the Commission proposal is more an amendment than a clarification and that, moreover, it affects basic concepts, instead of using the procedures under Article 2(2) of Council Regulation 2236/96 of 25 June 1996, for the adoption of changes to the methodology intended to clarify and improve the content of ESA 95, use should instead be made of the introduction procedure set out in Annex A of that regulation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 95. On closer examination, it now appears that the information recorded on taxes and social contributions is not as precise as was hoped because it does not always correspond to the amounts actually collected or collectable for a particular assessment year.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposal under discussion is to refine the recording procedure by applying a correction factor both to cash data and data evidenced by assessments and assessment registers.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group agrees with the Commission proposal in this regard. Two questions still remain, however. In view of the fact that the proposal effectively contains an amendment to the ESA 95 Regulation and that is implicitly acknowledged by the fact that we are applying the codecision procedure, it does seem logical to grant the Member States a transitional period. The Member States also need time to adjust to new rules. We have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and would ask our colleagues in the House and the Commission as well to support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">A second question to the Commission concerns the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regarding VAT as a basis for calculating the third source of own resources. I should have liked to hear the Commissioner confirm whether the Commission is indeed drawing up a proposal to amend Article 8 of the ESA 95 Regulation to the effect that all the Member States will, in the future, have an adequate legal basis to use ESA 95 for the calculation of the third source of own resources, that is to say, VAT. I should like a reply from the Commissioner and also, of course, a response from the Commissioner to our amendment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order for the accounting methods of the different Member States to be homogenous, as the rapporteur has pointed out, they must use the same criteria. It is true that, in accounting terms, both the cash receipt criterion and the income criterion can be allowed, but it is also true that the former allows for less juggling of the figures intended to distort the true accounts situation of a country.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the cash receipt criterion makes it more difficult to indulge in that accounting trickery which used to be known euphemistically as ‘creative accounting’. It is true that the use of those systems has allowed, for example, certain countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria, but it is also true that their abuse can distort the picture of a country’s true accounts. As you know, accounts which do not offer a true picture can be called anything but accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The income criterion, if it is not corrected, for example, by means of the obligation to make provision for non-payment, is an inadequate criterion. The rapporteur mentioned a debate which occurred in Spain which, in short, resulted from the government claiming ESP 750 000 million in 1997 as social security income, which was theoretically owed but which was clearly never going to be collected. Thanks to this manipulation of the accounts, to this ‘creative accounting’, the deficit criteria for joining the first phase of economic and monetary union were complied with. Obviously, this juggling of accounts will not be possible if the Commission’s proposal is approved. It is perhaps for this reason that the Spanish Members from the PPE Group have presented certain amendments and have tried to delay the approval of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of revising now what was done in the past. Ladies and gentlemen, what is done is done. It is a question of demanding, from now on, greater rigour; it is a question of demanding that accounting figures reflect the true picture of a country’s accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore approve of the Commission’s proposal but we do not approve the PPE’s proposal, which is intended to delay the entry into force of this regulation, or the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, since it considers that the regulation amounts to an amendment rather than a mere clarification, in reality delays its entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if rigour in accounting is demanded, it should be so from the outset.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Anybody who knows anything about accounting and who looks at this text with open eyes will know that this implies a profound change in the basic concepts and the data on the resources of the institutional sectors which affect financial companies, non-financial sectors, public administrations and private individuals. This change is a complicated change. As any expert knows, the estimations in accordance with ESA 95 require breakdowns which affect no less than 60 accounting categories.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way. As Mrs Thyssen has pointed out, changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time. At the end of the day this would lead to a fair change because a sudden change would prejudice those States which have adopted the criterion of income, in other words, those which have, to a greater extent, complied with the regulation which entered into force in 1999. We are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago. The PPE-DE’s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a broad welcome in the House for this proposal and the apparent ability to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the more notional contributions which may be due. This is certainly a step forward. It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the transition period is concerned, many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because, clearly, if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required. However, I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse, if it is passed, but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can – in other words, two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job.</p>
<p class="contents">On the treatment of taxes and social contributions, I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, this is a useful step forward. I welcome the commitment of the Commission. I hope that we can work together and see this translated into Community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By proposing these amendments, the Commission intended for the recording of taxes and social contributions within the ESA to be carried out according to equivalent methods and, therefore, that there be no differences in approach between the different national public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is basically of a technical nature and is intended to fill the current legislative vacuum which allows for differing interpretations depending on the position adopted by each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very happy that our proposal has received broad support and is happy with the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I will comment on shortly. However, I firstly wish to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr Knörr Borràs, for his work, which, on this complex and technical issue, has offered us great support. The rapporteur stresses in his report that the objective of the proposal is to arrive at the same figure, regardless of the statistical sources used, and in reality this is our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has approved eight amendments and the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 without any difficulty. There is a ninth amendment, presented later, which I will also comment on. The Commission would prefer not to maintain Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6. The aim of these amendments differs from that of the regulation. I understand that, insofar as certain elements of the regulation are amended, we could also discuss the model for calculation of VAT used to determine own resources, but we are talking about a radically different problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the concerns of the PPE, I would say that, when asking for the withdrawal of these amendments, logically the Commission must commit itself to presenting a proposal at some point to introduce that amendment, which is absolutely coherent, providing for more correct figures, which we hope will be used in the future to calculate the basis of the contribution to own resources. We hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 9, the issue has been studied by the directorate-general of ECOFIN and by Eurostat and, having analysed the problem in detail, I can tell you, Mr García-Margallo, that, in principle, exceptions, in statistical terms, must only be allowed where a Member State is not technically capable of providing data. This has been the case, for example, with the exceptions allowed for certain Member States within the ESA 95 regulations. We are therefore talking about a technical problem, of not having the capacity to provide data. In the case in question, there are no technical difficulties to justify that exception, and the regulation has been substantially amended throughout its negotiation to give it more flexibility, in such a way that, in our opinion, all the difficulties raised by the different Member States can be resolved within the margins of flexibility which the regulation allows. This is the reason why the Commission does not consider Amendment No 9 to be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">If everything that has been said here can facilitate a convergence of the positions of both Parliament and the Commission, and if Mr Knörr Borràs and the PPE can withdraw the amendments I have mentioned, we believe that this would allow us to make progress with the adoption of the text which will, without doubt, be positive in terms of clarifying future accounts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
