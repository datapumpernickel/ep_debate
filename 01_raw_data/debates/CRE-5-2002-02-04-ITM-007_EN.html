<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Friedrich who was the Vice-President in charge of the conciliation on road transport, and also Mr Rocard who took part as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs; in fact, all members of Parliament's delegation, because it was very much a team effort. Thanks are due to Commissioner Palacio and her staff for the crucial part they played at several points when it seemed we were at deadlock. Finally, I should like to thank the Belgian presidency for the energetic and determined way they pursued agreement on this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the conciliation on road transport is very much to be welcomed. It plugs one of the last remaining gaps in the working-time mosaic. It is profoundly important from the point of view of health and safety, and road safety more generally, and it is also important from the point of view of ensuring fair competition between the road, rail and other transport sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">On specifics, first we have secured the inclusion of self-employed drivers as a matter of principle. Some will be disappointed that will not take full effect until four years beyond transposition. But we should not forget that the Council's common position would almost certainly have led to the permanent exclusion of the self-employed. The Council wanted to exclude them in principle and only consider including them on the basis of a Commission study looking at possible distortions at some point in the future. Even then the Council would have been determined to block such a move from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a total reversal of that situation. The self-employed are included as a matter of principle and can only be excluded if two things happen: first, if the Commission proposes such an exclusion; and secondly, if we, as co-legislator here in Parliament, agree with such an exclusion. Neither of those things is very likely to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point in the outcome is a strong definition of self-employment. Even with only a temporary exclusion of the self-employed, we felt it was very important that we won a clear and limiting definition of what a self-employed driver actually is, to avoid unscrupulous employers pushing drivers into false forms of independence. We now have a very clear definition in Article 3(e), and the final sentence of that article is a catch-all: drivers who are not caught by the checklist of criteria included in the definition will be dealt with as though they are employees under the directive. That is an extremely useful definition.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also considerably improved and clarified the definition of working time. It also now applies to the self-employed except in respect of general administrative work, not linked directly to the specific transport operation under way. On night work, I again know that some will be disappointed that we did not succeed in limiting night work to eight hours. I will make three quick points regarding that. It would have been impossible to get that through Council. Most delegations were against. There are valid environmental and road safety reasons to transport goods – if they must be transported by road – at night. Concession on night work became a key in securing the inclusion of the self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a joint debate involving consideration of the importance of work, information and consultation. Members will see from Article 8 concerning derogations on weekly working time and night work that we have insisted upon the promotion of social dialogue as the first option.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that certain aspects of the text before us are highly relevant to the state of affairs being brought to light by the Kralowetz case. Those aspects seeking to block the creation of false independent status, dealing with record-keeping, and placing a focus on the duties of consigners and others responsible for determining routes and timetables, are particularly relevant. But Kralowetz makes two things glaringly obvious. First, in the enlargement process we desperately need additional social safeguard measures and a socially controlled opening of the labour market for workers from central and Eastern Europe, particularly in this sector. Secondly, it is glaringly clear that if the level of control exposed by this case continues, important texts like this one will be worth less than the paper they are printed on. We must insist on full and proper application of controls across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that it is absolutely essential that we have European-wide rules that are binding throughout the territories of the European Union, otherwise the Kralowetz case will be just one of many which we will see in the weeks and months to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With conciliation, which was concluded satisfactorily on 17 December last, the European Union defined minimum information and consultation standards to be applied throughout Union territory. Thus, after the directives on European Works Councils, the European Company Statute and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this directive completes the existing Community and national frameworks, which can help to ensure that necessary preparations are made for the change, that restructuring is carried out in an acceptable context and that the ‘employment’ objective is given the necessary priority in the current situation. It seems to me particularly significant that agreement has been reached before the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all the Member States have a legal framework in place – either statutory or contractual in origin – which seeks to ensure that workers are informed and consulted: almost all, I said, but not all, and this directive extends the right so that it exists throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, this directive recognises the rights of workers and their representatives in all undertakings with less than 50 employees to be informed and consulted about all aspects of the life of the undertaking, particularly the implications of company choices on employment, the organisation of work, training and skill development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the directive should focus on the content and procedures, including time frames, for informing and consulting workers. It explicitly lays down that information and consultation must be timely, for that is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation processes of undertakings and of processes identifying anticipatory measures necessary to offset negative impact on workers. It recognises a number of rights of workers’ representatives and of workers themselves; it lays down sanctions that the Member States have to introduce into their own legislation – when implementing and applying the directive – effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. I feel that this is a particularly important point and it has been the subject of much debate. The Commission’s initial plan, supported by Parliament, was to lay down a European sanction. However, in respect for the principle of subsidiarity, the directive stipulates that the Member States themselves should introduce sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">A transitional period is also laid down for those States which do not yet have any statutory system – either legal or contractual – although it is shorter than that provided for in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the European Parliament would have liked more: it would have liked more specific information, clearer definition and more content, but considering the sensitivity of the subject and the resistance in recent months from both governments and lobbies, I feel that we can consider ourselves satisfied with the result. The Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee voted unanimously for this agreement. We can be satisfied because rights are recognised, the social dialogue is given due importance and the principle of subsidiarity is respected while a uniform framework is defined for the entire territory of the Union: there will no longer be A class workers and B class workers when it comes to the rights recognised in undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by thanking, in particular, the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and her staff, the Belgian Presidency and Mrs Onkelinx. I would point out that we were three women, the three of us, in particular, working on this directive. I feel that it was our determination and our strong awareness of the major importance of the subject, not least – supported as we were, I by my committee and Parliament and the Commissioner and the Minister by their convictions – which enabled us to bring such a vital process to a conclusion. In my opinion, the Barcelona Summit will be a good opportunity for us to see whether our conclusions have a positive, practical impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am under the impression that Parliament would like me to make a statement on the case of the road haulage driver stuck in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. If that is the case, then I should like to say the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the information at the Commission's disposal, the Luxembourg authorities conducted a search on behalf of an inquiry led by the Tribunal of Munich in Germany of the premises in Luxembourg of an Austrian-based transport operator Kralowetz. This company has been active in Luxembourg since 1986 and was an international one established in eight different European countries. The technical manager, Mr Karl Kralowetz, was arrested on 22 January, and since 26 January approximately 150 lorries belonging to the Kralowetz company from different countries have assembled in Luxembourg on a parking bay of a customs centre and the drivers have complained that they have not been paid for more than three months. The majority of them may be considered as illegally employed. The Luxembourg authorities are in the process of organising the return of the drivers by plane to their country of origin and each driver will receive EUR 1,000 by way of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem is the unscrupulous behaviour of the transport operator concerned. He had used illegal labour – i.e. without social security status – with a salary which is not in conformity with national law or collective agreements and without a work permit. For several months the judicial authorities and rogatory committees of several Member States have been conducting investigations and enquiries and drawing up reports. All those actions have resulted in further searches, the arrest of some of those responsible and the confiscation of documents and equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the action of the judicial and administrative authorities but, nevertheless, regrets that such an affair could ever have been possible at all. This proves the need for a correct application of national laws, as well as the following Community rules in the field of international road transport operations. Firstly, the rules on admission to the occupation of road-transport operator, namely the three criteria of good repute, financial standing and professional competence; secondly, the rules on driving times and rest periods, for which the Commission has recently made a proposal for new, simplified and updated EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the following upcoming legal instruments are also relevant; firstly, the rules on working time, on which an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council is very much to be welcomed, and on which you will vote tomorrow. I should mention here the Commission's particular thanks to Mr Hughes. Secondly, the rules on a uniform driver attestation, for which Mr van Dam was your rapporteur, and for which the European Parliament gave its approval on 17 January. That regulation will put to an end the illegal employment of non-EU drivers in the Community, through checks on the legal employment status of such drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Community instruments exist or are in the process of being adopted. They need to be correctly applied by Member States, and this example should serve as a lesson to avoid any further repetition of such unscrupulous behaviour by cowboy operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the many abuses on a large scale, there are also many abuses on a small scale, for the transport sector is largely characterised by abuses. The system before us, involving stricter standards for working hours – indeed, not only driving hours are referred to, but also working hours – involves a tightening-up on the system used in the past. This can only work if the monitoring procedure is improved. If this does not happen – and I agree with what Mr Hughes has said – all these standards will be meaningless. Although monitoring is a national competence, a two-yearly report on the results of the monitoring procedure, which is to be submitted to the Commission, must still be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission to give its attention to this report once more and to reconsider the requirements made of the Member States in this connection. One of the aspects which the Commission is apparently verifying is whether foreign hauliers are subject to stricter monitoring than domestic hauliers, the latter being of one’s own nationality. Needless to say, this should not be used as a criterion. The Commission is right to investigate this, but it should widen the investigation as long as hauliers allow people to drive for too long at excessive speeds, because they are often required to arrive at their destination at a certain time. Commissioner – and I am aware that this is not within your competence – as long as the Member States apply different speed limits, this is all useless. The speed limit is 90 km/hour in one Member State, 100 km/hour in another and 80 km/hour in the next. Surely, the way in which transport in Europe is organised is sheer madness. This should all be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to monitoring, there is also the problem of penalties, which differ from one Member State to another. Actually, in the field of penalties, minimum standards should exist. I know that, at present, this is not a European competence, but this should change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as long as hauliers’ and truckers’ tachographs have to be inspected, cheating will always take place, because the tachograph is an instrument which ideally lends itself to this. It is therefore high time that the regulation we are waiting for were issued, stipulating that, in future, digital boxes must be fitted in cabs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Ghilardotti, I, too, had noticed that many women have been involved in these reports, both your report and that on working hours, and both during the Belgian Presidency and within the European Commission. This is a good result, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Normally, I am not one for using big words, certainly not as long as a negotiation process is still running, but now that we have reached the end of it, I shall venture to use superlatives after all and refer to the achievement of both these agreements as historic.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, it is very good that, after a long time, European labour legislation is now being laid down again. This fits in with the pursuit of a socio-economically ambitious Europe, as expressed in the Lisbon objectives, a dynamic and competitive economy with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. It is useful to stress the latter part of these objectives once again on the eve of the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Historic steps are being taken in both areas. The directive on information and consultation of employees forms an essential recognition of the right of employees to be involved beforehand in a company’s important decisions, and this forms part of the mores and the traditions of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation in terms of economic activity is necessary, but it also requires a pro-active approach which also takes employee participation seriously. In the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, this is recognised as a fundamental right. This directive elaborates upon this as a right for all companies in the Union. A third step is required for, if we take this employee participation seriously, it should also apply to restructuring and changes in companies. The Commission issued a document on this subject recently. I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein’s presence this evening, for it is particularly important in my view for this discussion also to be held concerning other areas and for the matter of employee participation to be raised in other areas too, for example in the case of take-overs and mergers of companies, and also in Commissioner Monti’s competition policy. In my opinion, this should be a very important discussion in future for, there too, employee participation should form a part of the tradition and routine.</p>
<p class="contents">As for drivers’ working hours, I should like to concur with what Mr Hughes said about the case which is running in Luxembourg. I should like to emphasise once more that a definition of the pseudo self-employed, devised at European level, can play a vital role in solving problems of this kind, because we do not have a European definition of this at the moment. However, the Member States, including the new countries, use their own definitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the delicate nature of the latter problem and the difficulties encountered in reaching an agreement, we believe that the adoption of the text under the conciliation procedure is a good solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on working time in the road transport sector aims to do away with situations where unfair competition and social dumping exist in the single market. Rules are also needed in order to guarantee suitable working conditions for drivers and thus prevent a decline in safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament asked for self-employed drivers to be included within the scope of the directive and demonstrated the need to treat all drivers equally, whether or not they are salaried employees. The inclusion of self-employed drivers is now provided for, seven years after the directive enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Commission has looked into the matter, it can, of course, decide to re-submit the inclusion of self-employed drivers to the co-decision procedure, especially because the definition of a self-employed worker prevents the creation of new forms of false self-employed drivers. I agree that this is a good thing, Mr Hughes, but even so, I still feel that there is something lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the lorry drivers stuck in Luxembourg – and I would also add, Mr Bolkestein, that they returned home last Friday with their earnings of EUR 1 000 – illustrates the kind of situation that can arise due to a lack of adequate Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen, there are unscrupulous and fearless transport entrepreneurs who have no hesitation in exploiting the gaps between, on the one hand, national laws and, on the other hand, national and Community legislation, who even go as far as breaking these laws and, most probably, rely on the lack of effective checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Some governments are aware of this situation. Therefore, in 1999, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg reached an administrative arrangement known as Eurocontrol Route, designed to improve and strengthen cooperation between the control services. But in order to ensure the competition conditions of road transporters are equal in the single market, we firstly need Community legislation, and then the Member States must strictly implement a system for monitoring and imposing fines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have carried out research into this industry for years, and I do not think that we are dealing with a cowboy society, but rather a cowboy industry. It is widely known that this industry is quite unhealthy. The rewards in this industry are quite low. It is a very fragmented industry with very many drivers operating on a small scale. There are also large companies that have gradually turned small drivers into self-employed or pseudo self-employed drivers. In short, there is a lot to be done. Working hours are being fiddled, and so are collective labour agreements as well as many other things. Against this backdrop, we bear a special responsibility, particularly regarding international transport, and we have duly taken this on.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the first things I did, or was allowed to do, when we came here was related to the Willy Betz construction. This was a case comparable to Kralowetz, but on a smaller scale. The trucks were of very high-quality, people ensured that all kinds of things were satisfactory, except for the work permits and a few other things. That led to this drivers' attestation directive. Fortunately, we are now in a position where we can welcome a second, very important directive on the organisation of working times.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, more loopholes in the legislation will need to be filled in future. Against this background, it is perhaps very good that the information and consultation directive – I should like to use the word historic – be adopted, for the very simple reason that, in the course of time, many large international transport companies have, in fact, been put under a flag of convenience, a process which often did not involve participation. They, in fact, turned drivers into self-employed drivers, or contracted them out to small self-employed entrepreneurs. There was no participation there either. We are now in a position where we can tackle issues of this kind more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where the directive regarding lorry drivers is concerned, this professional group will therefore be covered by the general legislation that regulates working time. This is obviously of significant interest not only to professionals but also to other road users. During the conciliation negotiations, there were several occasions on which I specifically emphasised the road safety aspect, which I think is important for those governments which are to administer this legislation in the future. It was also important that self-employed people should now be treated in the same way as other drivers for, from the road user’s point of view, it is immaterial whether he is run over by an employed or self-employed driver.</p>
<p class="contents">What is perhaps worrying about this directive is that the transition periods are so long. It will in actual fact be, at best, seven years before it is implemented, and we know that, even then, it will subsequently be difficult to track and monitor how the legislation operates in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second directive, on information and consultation, is a kind of framework agreement providing a legal basis that is important to workers’ being able to demand information and consultation rights. We must not, however, forget that – by means, for example, of Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the proposal for a directive, which offer scope for a more or less broad interpretation – it also provides legal opportunities to reject workers’ demands in certain cases.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucial, therefore, to how this directive goes on to operate in practice is how it is received in workplaces and how strong the trade unions are when it comes to pushing those demands to which the directive can give some leverage. I believe that this applies generally to this type of legislation. We can adopt directives which are sound and well-intentioned in many ways, but when they are then actually put into effect we know that we cannot, in this House, do very much. Nor do I believe that the governments of the Member States can do very much.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share Mrs Smet’s view that systems with tight controls can be designed. It is difficult to know what happens out on the roads, especially at night. It is difficult to know what goes on behind closed factory gates. It is only employees themselves who can do anything about what takes place. I therefore want to conclude this speech with a strong appeal to those in the workplace: Do not rely upon the problems’ being solved in the European Parliament or the Council, but assume that they have to be solved by yourselves and that you can be helped with them by the legislation that has been enacted in the form of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like at the same time to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, for leading us to that compromise, which is now very close to the common position. We have had quite vigorous discussions in our group on information and consultation, but we agreed that the common position is a really good starting point for a sensible solution. Starting with first reading in April 1999, and, indeed, in the committee meetings before that, there were often major differences of opinion between the groups; the rapporteur had to be agile – she was too – and the same was true for me as shadow rapporteur for the largest group, the PPE-DE.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a constructive compromise before us. What was possible has now been done. What mattered was at last to get a foot in the door, which can then be opened a bit wider by the next blast of wind. Second reading stage saw the PPE-DE prevail on many points. The majority in my group were opposed to European sanctions but in favour of national ones. The conciliation process saw these ideas incorporated in the recitals. In its final form, the framework directive primarily contributes to the functioning of the European Works Council. All local workers' representatives are given minimum rights helping them to assess the information received from the European Works Council. Secondly, it helps mitigate problems with restructuring, which affect national enterprises as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Works Councils directive, on the other hand, applies only to multi-national enterprises. The framework directive prescribes that the procedure be carried out in a spirit of cooperation. This means partnership, which, on the one hand, aims at the clear representation of interests, but also, on the other, their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue. Information at the right time results in transparency, which itself builds trust and avoids the enterprises sustaining frictional losses – an economic and social gain. Both employers and workers gain from this, and do so in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall concentrate on the directive concerning information and consultation rights of employees, but I also want to say something about working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities. It is very important that self-employed people should now be included, even if there is a transitional period, for we are concerned here with protective legislation for those whose job it is to drive lorries. In work of this kind, there is no difference between being employed and being self-employed. Just as Mr Schmid says, this is also a road safety issue and, from that point of view, it makes no difference whether the person driving is employed or self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Where information and consultation are concerned, I agree with Mrs van den Burg who, in her speech, said that the directive was of historic importance. It <span class="italic">is</span> of historic importance. Three women have been involved. I can add a fourth. When, in June during the Swedish Presidency, the Council succeeded in reaching a common position, which laid the basis for this directive, a female Swedish minister was also involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it quite obvious that there should be this type of information and consultation in an internal market, that an internal market is not only about companies’ rights but also employees’ rights and that the latter must be informed and be able to put forward their views.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, people in Sweden can be heard saying, ‘What does this really mean for Sweden when we, of course, have much better legislation?’ Well now, that is true. Our legislation is such that this directive does not perhaps affect us at all. That being said, minimum directives are still important, not only for those countries which do not have such good legislation but also, indirectly, to prevent an internal market with social dumping arising whereby companies are set up whose employees suffer poor conditions. Accordingly, it is important for all the countries that we should increase the minimum levels and have minimum directives that lead to better conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I again want to thank the rapporteurs for two good directives. I hope that we can go further and improve information and consultation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Kralowetz is, though, also in essence a European problem. It is proof that ‘social Europe’ does not exist. In 1998, the European Union completely liberalised the transport sector, without at the same time providing for the social security regulations it needed. Kralowetz and other cases are now showing us the consequences of that. The Commission must, in my opinion, do more than what has been talked about this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, in my judgment, three core issues. Firstly, the controls must be tightened up. What is the use of laws if we do not check that they are obeyed?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, social security documentation must be harmonised across the EU. We should not wait until the end of 2003 to do this, but try to get it on track as early as the beginning of that year.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, and probably most important, point is that the ECMT transport licence system, which allows enterprises from outside the EU to drive through the Member States, is today encouraging social dumping and illegality and will still be encouraging them tomorrow if we do not manage to tie these ECMT transport licences to minimum social standards. If this is not done, then Karl Kralowetz only needs to travel to Russia tomorrow and he can continue to run his unscrupulous business from there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We take a favourable view of the points achieved in the Conciliation Committee, and are as one with you on the points you have already mentioned, namely the inclusion of the self-employed, a clear definition of self-employment, clearly-defined work times – in respect of which, of course, more redress can again be demanded of enterprises – and the need to define exceptional circumstances as regards weekly work times and work at night.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues have already stated that, without controls and sanctions, no directive will achieve any kind of progress. I believe that this is where we have to make a start. The Commission has presented a new regulation on the harmonisation of certain social security regulations relating to road transport, which will, in consequence, soon be on Parliament's agenda. There are, at present, marked discrepancies between the results achieved in the Conciliation Committee and the new proposal, which must be cleared up, and this is something on which coordination is needed. This, of course, means that we also have an opportunity to play our part in laying down sanctions and controls in much stronger form, for it is a regulation we are dealing with, and that means it is legally binding and effective in quite another way.</p>

They won and I lost, to my regret and possibly their surprise. We all know that if the Council had not given in then Parliament itself would have conceded rather than lose either directive. So Parliament had a weak hand but both rapporteurs played it extremely well. I congratulate them for their skill.</p>
<p class="contents">They were helped by the early climb-down of the UK Government during both conciliation processes. It was particularly ironic that the UK Minister for Europe should have come to Strasbourg last autumn – to plead with UK MEPs from all parties to vote down the whole Ghilardotti report – to find that not only were Labour MEPs positively promoting the report but the UK representative then bent over backwards to support it as well. Politics is certainly an odd business.</p>
<p class="contents">As colleagues know, I am a fervent supporter of information and consultation but an equally fervent opponent of a one-size-fits-all straitjacket for companies of all shapes and sizes. This directive, as amended, is more likely, in my view, to be a barrier to employee involvement than a bridge.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving to the working time directive: in my view this is bad legislation. It could have been worse had it limited night-time driving, but I was delighted that the rapporteur finally saw reason and this proposal was removed. But it is still bad legislation in its provisional extension to include the self-employed. As the Spanish representative said, when joining other countries in registering his country's dissent from the final text, it is the first time that the entrepreneurial sector has been included in any directive. I will certainly fight to make sure it is the last. We should want to see more jobs, not less. This should not and must not be seen as a precedent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Scarcely ever before has it been made so clear to us what is actually going on in this particular labour market and what is happening to these lorry drivers. If ever you talk to European lorry drivers, you will hear how people in that sector work, some of them illegally, and what sort of wages they are paid for doing so; they drive to the point of exhaustion, and not all of them have social security insurance. That is the reality of one European labour market, and that is the problem facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">Looked at from this angle, this work time regulation is long overdue – in the interests of our safety on the roads and of the safety of the workers, that is, the drivers themselves. I might add that, as has already been mentioned, this case is not only an issue for Luxembourg or about a few Austrian businessmen, we now know that we are dealing with a large number of Austrian businessmen. It is also a European phenomenon. For me as an out-and-out advocate of European enlargement, the core problem is the way we are doing the dirty on workers from the candidate countries; it is these workers who are bound today by collective contracts to work for derisory wages, and under conditions which are, in social terms, appalling. Such is the way this group of workers has entered into our European Union, and that is what we have to take a stand against.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, though, every cloud has a silver lining. In Austria, my country, a group of hauliers' representatives has already taken a stand and spoken out in favour of European regulations tending towards controls and measures that will influence even this ruinous competition. That is the situation we face.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, Commissioner, that you should be prompted by that to think more and better about control systems for workers in the European labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I would like to point out that the approval of these two directives constitutes an important step within the construction of European labour law and, therefore, in the construction of a social Europe, and all this, furthermore, by means of dialogue and mutual concessions from positions which were initially comprehensible. Of course, the inclusion of the self-employed may go against the entrepreneurial spirit<span class="bold">,</span> as my country maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the general framework for information and consultation, the Chapter IV of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, entitled ‘Solidarity’, begins with Article 27, which establishes, under the title ‘Workers' right to information and consultation within the undertaking’, that ‘Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Community law and national laws and practices’.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 136 of the European Union Treaty already indicated that social dialogue was an objective of the Community and the Member States. It therefore seems logical and necessary that, outside other specific directives, such as Directive 94/45/EC, a single directive should establish a general framework which lays down minimum requirements for the exercise of the right to information and consultation in undertakings and workplaces within the Community. These rights, previously laid down in the European Social Charter of 1961, and in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, of 1989, are now, as I have said, included in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. It should surprise nobody that workers, via their representatives, should be aware of the situation and development of the undertaking, the decisions which are to be taken and their repercussions and effects for the future, since their existence and, above all, subsistence, are often linked to the undertaking. Of course, the content of these rights must be aimed at strengthening the undertaking, increasing employment possibilities and adapting workers to new or revised production processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, experience demonstrates that the mechanisms have not always worked well: workers have become involved late in the process of decision-making, when decisions had already been taken. I therefore feel that the content of Article 4 is particularly worth highlighting...</p>

<p class="contents">I am myself from a frontier region and know perfectly well that the word in the sector is currently that whoever best knows the rules of the individual countries can make the most money. The lobby that is active here is neither a lobby for the workers nor a lobby against them – I do not think it has anything to do with Luxembourg's legislation either – nor is it a lobby for or against the employers. At the end of the day, both of them are the losers in the Luxembourg situation, and, indeed, we again reminded the Commission of this in the celebrated van Dam report. Our concern is not with adding more and more directives and piling up ever more detail; what matters to us is that those countries should be ready to tackle this together, so that employers can charge proper prices without suffering from this dumping that is being organised there and the workers can of course work under proper conditions. I declare without equivocation that the lobby that is working against this is in essence a lobby supporting nobody but those who cheat and disregard the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the first report, an HGV driver who is also the owner of his own HGV is always on the fringes of legality if he wants to work and earn a decent living. That is the situation we are living in. This means that we have to consider the developing liberalisation in goods transport by road firstly in economic terms, secondly from the employer's – and also the employee's – standpoint, but always from the same perspective, and I believe we can represent both interests equally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has to be emphasised first in this deplorable business is that it is not Luxembourg's legislation and practices that deserve to be pilloried here, but the way the Kralowetz affair has highlighted social deficits in the European area and the European Union, a sphere in which such things are inexcusable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, in the first place, is blame to be laid at the door of the European Commission, but rather at that of the majority of the Member States, who are refusing to agree to common rules on working conditions and respectable wage levels in order to counteract social dumping within the internal market. As regards the proposed EU directive on lorry drivers' driving times, it has been the Luxemburgers, of all people, together with the French and the Belgians, who have, in the Transport Affairs Council, worked to include the pseudo self-employed in the directive's scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the praiseworthy efforts as regards the Eurocontrol Route mentioned by Mrs Flesch, it is this nigger that is lurking in the woodpile of the Kralowetz affair. We need legislation at Community level that leaves no room for legal grey areas, which are shamelessly exploited by people who – as our Prime Minister trenchantly expressed it – possess a certain criminal energy. That is the lesson we must learn, and I hope that the Member States that have hitherto refused to agree to common rules will now cease from obstructing tighter regulation at EU level, so that this modern form of slavery can now be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to emphasise that a reform of the right of establishment in Luxembourg is on its way through the official channels, and will incorporate stricter criteria making it less easy for dodgy firms to get permits and licences to trade in a perfectly legal way, which is in any case not that easy in view of current EU directives on the definition of businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the devotees of the complete liberalisation of the transport of goods by road, who have so strongly advocated that cause in this House, and no longer have anything to offer against the practices of entrepreneurs like Kralowetz …</p>

I should in particular like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, and, above all, your rapporteur, Mr Hughes, for their excellent work. As a result of their efforts, their ability and their determination, it is finally possible to adopt a measure which the Commission proposed more than three years ago – a very successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting this directive, we are making essential progress towards eliminating the competition distortions in the road sector but, above all, towards improving road safety. This directive will not only allow the elimination of abuses in that sector but also facilitate a better balance between modes. Revitalisation of rail will be possible only with the end of wild competition in road transport. It is thus essential for Member States to make the necessary controls in order to ensure that the new legislation should be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive lays down minimum conditions for the organisation of the working time of drivers and also takes into account all the activities which are performed by drivers in addition to driving. Thanks to this Parliament, it will ultimately be possible for this directive to cover all drivers of all categories, whether self-employed or not. That is a great achievement for road safety because tiredness obviously affects all drivers in the same way, whether they work for a firm or are self-employed. Asking the Commission to investigate the effects of exclusion and as a result of its investigations to propose special conditions for the inclusion of self-employed drivers, certainly is the best approach. Let me thank you once again for the determination that Members of this Parliament have shown throughout the conciliation procedure, which has enabled us to adopt the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, on the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, I should like to express my congratulations to her and to all Members of this Parliament on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council on this very important directive. This agreement was only possible due to the spirit of compromise shown by Parliament and the Council. The final draft of the directive, as we see it now, firstly meets completely the initial Commission goals, i.e. to establish and develop throughout the Union good practices of worker information and consultation, focused on anticipating and managing change. Secondly, it gives leeway to action from social partners when it comes to implementing the provisions of the directive. Thirdly, it is compatible with all national systems and provides for mechanisms allowing for a smooth introduction of the new arrangements in all of them. Fourthly, it reflects the views of the two legislators as at least 15 of Parliament's amendments in its two readings have been incorporated into the text. Therefore, the draft before us deserves acceptance, certainly from the Commission but also from Parliament and the Council. Once adopted, the directive will complete the Community framework in the field of worker information and consultation, a framework which provides European companies and their workers with an essential tool to facilitate change and to ensure that it is carried on in a socially acceptable way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission very much hopes that the considerable work done in this field in recent years will now be continued through a positive and proactive attitude from social partners in relation to the consultation documents it presented to them two weeks ago on the social aspects of corporate restructuring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
