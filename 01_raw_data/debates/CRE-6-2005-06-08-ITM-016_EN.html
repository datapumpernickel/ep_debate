<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I said this morning that one of the items on the agenda for the European Council was reform of the UN, and in particular the summit in September of this year, during which we hope this reform can be introduced. As we have already discussed and emphasised, the European Union attaches very great importance to that reform. On a number of occasions we have expressed our support for the contents of the report of the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented on 21 March of this year, and the preparatory reports on which it was based. These reports are in line with the general approach set out in the European security strategy, and open up some promising avenues towards a stronger and more effective multilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union supports the global concept of collective security recommended by the Secretary-General, recognising that threats to peace and security are not only represented by war, international conflicts, riots, organised crime, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, but also by poverty, under-development, deadly epidemics and environmental damage – in particular the issue of global warming. The European Union gives its agreement in principle to the package of measures presented by the Secretary-General, while at the same time maintaining an open mind. It intends to play a leadership role in the preparatory process for the September summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union believes that significant efforts must be made to obtain the best possible results at the summit across a wide spectrum of issues. It is crucial to maintain a balance between the Secretary-General’s three major objectives of development, security and human rights. The challenge is, therefore, to achieve a critical mass of reforms within a consistent long-term approach, while at the same time holding out the possibility of further progress later on. We in the European Union are accustomed to these step-by-step approaches, with recourse to transition periods.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards development, the European Union fully shares the Secretary-General’s view on the interdependence of the various areas involved. It would also emphasise unambiguously that development is an end in itself, not merely a means to achieve security. The Union is firmly committed to implementing the Millennium Declaration. It emphasises the link between achieving the Millennium goals and the implementation of the results of UN international conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and other spheres. I am not even going to reiterate the goals we set during the last General Affairs Council on the issue of increasing development aid up to 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union would like a certain number of matters of vital importance for the achievement of the Millennium goals to be taken into due account in the conclusions of the summit. We also attach particular importance to joint and collective action to combat AIDS. We want to reflect jointly on the link between environmental viability, security and the elimination of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the various security-related aspects, the European Union strongly supports the idea of creating a peace consolidation committee. This is a priority for the Union, and an agreement on this issue at the September summit is vital. This proposal serves to plug a gap. During the migration from a state of war to a state of lasting peace, this peace consolidation committee could help intensify the UN-led planning activity in support of a lasting recovery, while at the same time strengthening the institutions which guarantee the rule of law and good governance. In parallel, it could play a significant role in the prevention of subsequent conflicts, which is often an important factor in cementing a lasting peace. This peace consolidation committee would be a permanent body which could assist the Security Council and Ecosoc during the various phases of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The link with Ecosoc is particularly important in relation to development. The committee should also help to ensure that reconstruction and peace-keeping strategies are consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the prevention of terrorism, the Union supports the global strategy proposed by the Secretary-General both in his report and in his Madrid speech. We need to emphasise that terrorism is unacceptable in all circumstances, irrespective of the underlying causes invoked. The Union would point out that the five pillars of the Secretary-General’s proposed approach coincide with the strategy which the Union has been developing since the 11 September 2001 attacks, and which it subsequently reaffirmed following the tragic events in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also supports the Secretary-General’s recommendations in relation to non-proliferation and disarmament – recommendations which, in general terms, coincide with the approach in the European strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As it will only be possible to achieve results through a collective effort, the Union is ready to take initiatives in that direction, in a multilateral context, and to raise these issues during its regular contacts and political dialogue in order to convince its partners to take account of these recommendations as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union believes that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represents the gravest and most immediate threat to international peace and stability. Universal guarantee agreements and additional protocols should now be the norm in terms of nuclear verification. Additionally, negotiations for a treaty to halt the production of fissile material should be brought rapidly to a successful conclusion. The Union also intends to take an active part in the development of binding international instruments to regulate the marking, tracing and illicit dealing in small-calibre arms and light weapons, issues we have already had the opportunity of discussing during sittings of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union reiterates its hope that adoption of the principle of the responsibility to protect can become one of the major priorities of the summit. Violations of human rights, impunity and breaches of the rule of law remain among the main factors threatening peace and security, while at the same time hindering the development process. The Union supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to adopt and apply the principle of the responsibility to protect the potential or actual victims of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other mass violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the use of force, the Union believes that the concept and principles proposed by the Secretary-General represent a good basis on which all parties should be prepared to work. The criteria proposed are political rather than legal in nature and should reflect a broad international consensus, which should prove helpful to members of the Security Council in their deliberations which could potentially lead to the use of force.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to applaud the importance accorded to human rights and the rule of law in the Secretary-General’s report. The Union supports any proposal to reinforce democracy and to place human rights at the centre of the UN's system. We insist on the need to reinforce the system of human rights, in particular by incorporating them into all the activities of the UN system, which would strengthen its capacity to react at any time to breaches of those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the appeal to strengthen the office of the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights and to allocate sufficient funding to reinforce his ability to discharge his mandate. The Union therefore agrees with the establishment of a permanent Council for Human Rights, as it could help to enhance the importance attached to human rights within the UN system.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty years after the war and after the creation of the United Nations, the time has come to give fresh impetus to multilateralism, to reform the United Nations system, a system vital for global security, harmonious development of all nations and the consolidation of peace. I believe we have a real opportunity. The European Union must play an active part in that reform and I count on Parliament to support the Council and Commission in that endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, on his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The September 2005 UN Summit, to be held on the 60th anniversary of the UN, is an opportunity that must not be missed. The summit represents an opportunity to take decisions leading to a more efficient United Nations and one that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last three weeks President Barroso and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have both been to New York, where they held constructive discussions on the summit preparations with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, his deputy, Louise Fréchette, and the President of the UN General Assembly, Ambassador Ping. During those talks, all the parties underlined the need for continuous and strong EU leadership in the preparations for the summit, in order to achieve substantial results in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, together with the presidency and Member States, is thus reaching out to partners, both in New York and in capitals throughout the world. The active involvement of Parliament in mobilising other parliamentarians around the world on the summit agenda would also be extremely useful.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 June we received the draft outcome for the summit, which provides us with a good starting point but nonetheless requires a strong European Union input if we are to achieve ambitious results during the September summit. I am glad to see that the views expressed in the resolution tabled by this Parliament are similar to those of the Commission in many respects.</p>
<p class="contents">As the UN Secretary General's report correctly states and as is underlined in Parliament's resolution, progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) requires urgent attention. A serious boost to common actions is needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">On 24 May the European Council agreed the Commission's ambitious proposals to achieve collectively 0.56% of GNI for ODA by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015. This is an important step forward for international solidarity and a clear sign of the European Union's commitment to a successful summit. We hope that it will provide a strong impetus for others to follow our example.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to address a few of the UN reform proposals on the table that are of particular interest for reinvigorating the effectiveness of the United Nations. The Commission has been actively engaged in the discussions on the proposed Peace Building Commission, which could fill the very real gap that currently exists within the UN institutional machinery for dealing with the period between the end of a conflict and long-term sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution's support for the Peace Building Commission. The Commission supports as broad a mandate as possible for the Peace Building Commission, including support for democracy, functioning institutions and strengthening the rule of law. Its work should consolidate peace and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts. In terms of its membership, both UN Security Council and ECOSOC membership should be represented, as well as major donors and contributors to peace building, international financing institutions, and key UN agencies, funds and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community's longstanding, worldwide and sustained peace building efforts are well known. I am therefore glad to inform you that, in the preparatory work for the summit, the European Union has decided to press for the participation of the European Community in all meetings of the Peace Building Commission. I trust that Parliament will be able to support that position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission strongly welcomes the UN Secretary General's proposals relating to human rights A substantial reform of the current UN human rights architecture, including the replacement of the ailing UN Commission on Human Rights by a standing Human Rights Council, is essential if the system is to be made more efficient and credible.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate objective is to make human rights protection and promotion effective worldwide. I am therefore delighted to see that we agree on the proposed Human Rights Council. The proposed election of the Council by the General Assembly should extend a sense of ownership to the wider UN community. Ownership must, however, be balanced by responsibility and the Secretary-General's view that States seeking membership of the Council should demonstrate a 'solid record of commitment to the highest human rights standards' is a welcome requirement, also in view of the obligations deriving from membership of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the issue of reforming the Security Council is one of the high-profile elements of the current UN reform debate. I note with interest the proposals made in the resolution for the establishment of an 'EU' seat. Whilst Security Council reform is naturally an issue of great importance, it must not be allowed to stall the whole process of vital reform of other UN institutions or other important areas where progress is needed. I would call upon all Member States of the UN to make every effort to ensure such paralysis does not occur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports better environmental integration across the UN system, including the establishment of a UN Environmental Organisation, and is delighted to see that the European Union is coming together on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by stating my satisfaction at the degree of concurrence that exists between us on many of the key topics at the heart of this issue. Furthermore, I wish to underline the Commission's determination to continue to work towards achieving good results in September and ensuring implementation of the summit's outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This September, in New York, the European Union should send out a clear message to the effect that we want reform and institutions that work better, and that we encourage Kofi Annan to proceed down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as a typical example that we could put before those members of the public who think that the nation states might achieve more. The challenges that we face, though, leave us no alternative to action on a global scale. If we are to combat terrorism, to address the problems of failing states, if we are to deal with the world’s shifting climate and to campaign for human rights and democracy around the world, then we need a strong United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is, then, that in the report to be put before the plenary tomorrow, the House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs has limited itself to responding to the High Panel’s proposals. Rather than drafting a new report on the UN in succession to the one we adopted last year, we have got to grips with what the High Panel has proposed, and one topic that has been very much on our minds in doing this has been that of collective security. Reform of the United Nations should be underpinned by the principles of prevention, awareness and shared responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that had a high priority for us was freedom from want, in the shape of a renewed development policy, something that ties in very well this year with the fifth anniversary of the year 2000’s Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing that matters to us is that the institutions be renewed and made more representative and more efficient, and so we have reiterated our call for a seat for Europe. We know it is not realistic to expect to achieve this by September, but, even if Europe does not get a seat, we want it to be more present. If there are to be new seats of whatever kind, we want them to go to the European Union, which will then appoint its representatives in the Security Council. That would be a small sign that things were going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations cannot be reformed by its Secretary-General; that is for the states to do. It is for that reason that we appeal to the European Council for the states represented within it to join together in supporting Kofi Annan and his programme of reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A stronger United Nations is the right response to the challenges that the international community faces in the 21st century. I am glad of the general agreement in the House, and grateful to Mr Laschet for his report. We may be in different groups, but we take a similar view of things.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament see it as important that reforms should not be limited to the institutions, but should also aim to strengthen the UN in the performance of its tasks and in its mission. One prominent objective for the coming years is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; we have to succeed in halving the incidence of poverty, illiteracy and the major diseases by 2015. If we manage that, we will have made a contribution to the world’s peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN’s role in peace missions and in conflict management needs to be enhanced. A large number of proposals have been made as to how this might be done, ranging from an anti-terrorist convention to the delegation of the rights contained in Chapter VII of the UN Charter to recognised regional organisations such as the African Union or the European Union. Why should peoples not resolve the conflicts on their own continents themselves, before the men in blue helmets arrive from elsewhere?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the need for stronger institutions. The Security Council is the sensitive issue here. We are agreed that Europe should, in the long term, have a seat on it. It may be that a mechanism is already being devised for its non-permanent members whereby the European Council would mandate Member States to perform this duty on the European Union’s behalf and in consultation with its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN also needs to be made more democratic. The demand is also being made for a Parliamentary Assembly within the UN; let us seize the opportunity, for it is one that does not come often. Now is the time for the package to be wrapped up! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Never before has there been such a great desire for fundamental renewal of the organisation; never before, too, has reform been so urgently needed. Like Mr Leinen and Mr Laschet, who have already spoken, I rejoice in the broad consensus that we have here: the clear affirmation of belief in the Millennium Development Goals is something we can all echo, just as we can all aim to improve the synergy between conflict prevention, peacemaking and peacekeeping. We are agreed on the need for better resources – and more of them – for this, and on the need for a more rapid response to events in crisis regions, with clear rules for deployments in them. To address acute dangers such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is a need not only for clearly defined and internationally recognised rules, but also the political will to act. It is in this respect that the international legal standard that is coming into being, and according to which we have a duty to defend others, constitutes a quite crucial step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the UN’s institutions will be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Its General Assembly must become more productive; rather than mounting, year in and year out, repetitively vacuous debates without concrete results, it must get back to debating things that really matter. ECOSOC, too, must make a markedly better job of performing its tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Security Council, too, is in need of reform. On 24 June, the Committee on Foreign Affairs put before the House a resolution it had adopted on this subject. While united in our desire for a permanent seat on it, we do know – particularly after the failure of the referenda – that the legal and institutional framework conditions for such a seat will not be in place before mid-September this year. Is this a reason to delay the reform? No, it is not; the world will not wait for the EU, and so all our Member States must, for the United Nations’ sake and for multilateralism’s sake, give the reform their backing, even though not all of them will be able to have a seat in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanism to which Mr Laschet referred is one that we have devised together; it involves the European seats being allocated in close consultation with the EU. I might add that this debate – particularly after the failure of the French referendum – should be being held in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implementation of this report and completion of the reform are matters of importance in terms of world politics, and I was very glad to hear that both the Council and the Commission are committed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four major and crucial aspects of this reform in which we must make progress. The first is the reform and extension of the UN Security Council, accompanied by the clear and unambiguous definition of the UN’s exclusive right to exercise force. It would be a very good thing if the discussion on the expansion of the Security Council were to enable Europe to get a seat on it, resulting in a real structural change in the way in which Europe’s policies are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the process of transforming international development policy into an international structural policy in the true sense of the word. The essential means to this end is the reinforcement and upgrading of the United Nations’ Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC; and close cooperation between it and the Group of Twenty really could plant the seed and lay the foundation of a new World Economic Council, which would be capable of steering the global economy in the direction of a sustainable policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the UN’s environmental programmes need to be transformed into a real UN environmental organisation, one that is sustainable and well organised. This is a major task.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point is an important one: the Human Rights Commission should be upgraded to a permanent council on human rights elected by the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Security policy, development policy, environmental policy, human rights policy – these are the four pillars in which we need to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The devastation of the Second World War, the horror and the uniqueness of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis, the deaths of millions of people and soldiers, not to mention the unpunished crime of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought forth a hope and a commitment: that the peoples of the United Nations could be certain of having a vehicle to make war history. That is now a long time ago. The UN has lost its effectiveness and the major countries have striven to see it go under – one need only think about the preventative and humanitarian wars, which in reality have been trials of lethal weapons, virtually weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform, or rather, a refounding of the United Nations is crucial. The Organisation has to return to a situation in which it is able to maintain peace by means of justice, promote disarmament, combat poverty and uphold democracy. Upholding democracy also means guaranteeing transparency and participation, not only by national governments, but also by the people and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Laschet’s report is important, as is the ability of our Parliament to strive towards strengthening and coordinating the United Nations. I agree with his proposals: strengthening the commitment towards human rights, protecting nature and the environment, combating poverty and strengthening the European Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC). Those are all fundamental commitments, also in terms of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Mr Laschet was speaking about ‘freedom from want’ and about the need to encourage Kofi Annan and obviously to forcefully resume the Agenda for Peace issued by Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight a fundamental issue, that is, the complete anachronism of the Security Council and its anti-democratic nature, which is symbolised by the right of veto. I believe that it is important to strive towards abolishing it and for the European Union to be represented by one voice, together with the other continents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will ignore the vacuity of the project, reform of the UN: when I first had the honour of serving my country in the UN, in 1992, the issue of UN reform was already under discussion. The story is old hat! The fact is that the UN is based on a Security Council which, in turn, is based on five permanent members, who have taken the UN as far as it could go – often for the better but sometimes for the worse. As for Europe, it is represented in the UN by non-permanent rotating members and by two major powers holding a right of veto, namely Great Britain and France. Moreover, no alternative architecture appears possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not the worst aspect. This Parliament has no power to debate this subject, or even – as Mr Laschet has said in somewhat derisory fashion – to send messages to New York. That is absolutely meaningless. Our separatist French delegation will not take part in the vote tomorrow as a sign of protest against the determination of this Parliament to act as if it could encroach on the States’ prerogatives, and, worse still, to act as if there had been no referendum, or, in other words, as if the Constitution was not dead.</p>
<p class="contents">I solemnly warn you against a collective abuse of power: we are behaving as if, one day, there could be a Constitution, or a common foreign and security policy, or a European foreign minister. These things will never happen! The people do not want them. And if you want to impose them by force, you would be basing the future development of Europe on a <span class="italic">putsch</span>, thereby rendering all our decisions illegal and eliciting an appropriate – and undoubtedly violent – response from our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Approval of that proposal will increase the disparity among the Member States of the UN and will pose the problem of extending the right of veto, with the attendant risk of paralysing the Security Council. At European level, Germany’s entry into the Council would conversely mean abandoning once and for all a project of a Europe endowed with a serious and effective foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, which has always been committed to the European Union having one single seat, is now leading the UFC group, which is opposed to the G4 proposal, hoping for the Council to be restructured on a regional basis. It is only by means of this type of reform that the European Union would obtain the role that belongs to it at international level.

In order to be effective, however, a reform has to be agreed upon by the largest number of countries possible, it has to enjoy a broad consensus, it has to reflect the growing importance of regionalism in international relations, and it cannot be rushed through.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn plans to reform the Security Council like the so-called ‘G4 plan’, as Mrs Angelilli pointed out, which would result in weakening the main body of the United Nations and freezing it in its current difficulties. We believe that all countries have the right to serve in the Security Council, by means of periodic elections guaranteeing that the many regional experiences are represented. In this spirit, we have asked for separate votes on paragraphs 19, 20 and 21, in order to remove a number of ambiguities in Mr Laschet’s nonetheless excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Much is said, including in this House, on the issue of a European seat. In order for something like that to exist, however, a common European foreign policy is required, and I believe that we are still very far from reaching that objective. There is no doubt, moreover, that the recent twin ‘no’ vote on the Constitution has made the passage even more difficult. One day the European seat will be obtained but here and now we rule out permanently delegating one Member State to represent the Union, as that would discriminate against the other Member States, even though Italy would in that case have the full numbers required to be able to stand as a candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations is currently undergoing embarrassing revelations and scandals that are damaging its reputation. When we talk about reforms, therefore, we must not only consider the Security Council, but also, as this report rightly does, the United Nations in its entirety. Having been powerless and crippled for many years by the rivalry between the superpowers, the United Nations has once again to find new energy and new life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The demise of a draft Constitution is not the end of all the Treaties binding us together! Europe has done enough to earn the right to send a collective message. Laschet, my congratulations on your good report! If there is any abuse of power – that was indeed the word used – it is by taking the salary of a Member of the European Parliament and then biting the hand that feeds you, ignoring all the efforts we have been making for sixty years.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I support this Laschet report. In these dark days for Europe, I am happy to see this rare moment of convergence between the Council, the Commission and our Parliament. I am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is customary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and I am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to give you a message for the Presidency. We can try to reform the United Nations, but it would be better to start by reforming ourselves. I am certain that the 700 or so colleagues who are absent are not merely enjoying a siesta. They are at work in their offices. Our work is badly organised. We need one or two major debates in plenary session each month in this building and, apart from that, everything should be discussed in committees. These debates should be dignified affairs. It is impossible, with only a couple of minutes available, to make an analysis or express a line of thought.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – begging your pardon for representing a Parliament of which I am basically a little ashamed – that my main concern is that by defending this good report and all the good work we do together in Europe, you might be aiming at the wrong target. There are too many responsibilities, too may targets. It is true that Europe has its reasons for wanting a seat on the Security Council. It is true that the time is not ripe and this is virtually out of the question at present. I would advise you not to waste too much time on it and to focus on what is reasonably possible, on what would generally make a difference and on aspects where our work, and in particular the Laschet report, can be constructive. I would quote Article 2 and chapter VII on the transfer of the right to invoke the Charter to regional organisations. This is a great innovation. I would also cite the transformation of the Trusteeship Council into a Council for Failed States. Finally, I would mention the introduction, in Article 17, of a reference to global public goods. As I have overrun my allotted time, I will stop here.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all absurd; we are all saying more or less the same thing. Do not aim for the wrong target. Concentrate on the innovative aspects – and only on them – and we shall have done a good job.</p>

That is a fact. And it is also the case that the United Nations must be reformed, just as we are doing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of the United Nations, an in-depth and immediate reform is clearly urgent, fundamentally because the Member States are currently subjecting it to a twofold restriction, of a budgetary nature, firstly, and secondly, of a political nature. The reports by the high-level panel and by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, provide, I believe –– and here I agree with Mr Laschet –– an excellent starting point for analysis and debate, and I would therefore also urge the Commission and the Council to take them sufficiently into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember the anti-war mobilisations, in particular those that led us to question the importance of a war in Iraq. I believe that, at this time when world military spending has risen to one billion dollars per year while at the same time the States do not provide money for the Millennium objectives, this review is more necessary than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PPE-DE Group amendment to the report demanded that the EU should be guaranteed a seat in the UN Security Council. That word ‘guaranteed’ is incompatible with the UN High-level Panel’s view that no change in the composition of the Security Council should be regarded as permanent in the future. In both of the Panel’s proposed models for reform of the Security Council, the current permanent members would retain seats. That is not what the Eurofanatics want to hear. They want the EU to take over the seats of France and the UK. However, even Mr Brok’s report conceded that an increased role for the EU was pending the entry into force of the new Constitutional Treaty. The Constitution is dead; the EU has no legal personality; Europe is not a nation and the EU, therefore, has no place in the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the most important functions of the United Nations is the delivery of its aid to the less developed world. Corruption and a lack of transparency erode public support. A fundamental reform is needed of what the United Nations does with its aid delivery. For the first time, Internet technology has made it possible to bring transparency into the raising of international aid funding in the donor countries and the delivery of aid in the recipient countries. We must be able to see how the aid is being spent, brick by brick. A closer involvement by citizens through the Internet will create a new driving force for the effective delivery of aid and for holding governments, the United Nations and other NGOs accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil strife and gross violations of human rights are the principal obstacles to United Nations development objectives. One civil war can undo decades of development effort. It is therefore essential to give our full backing to the work of the international criminal courts and to make it clear that anyone who commits crimes against humanity will be personally called to account for his or her action.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations must be able to anticipate and prevent. It must be a peace-builder and a peacekeeper. On 24 February, this Parliament passed a unanimous resolution demanding that Nigeria surrender to the United Nations international court the former President of Liberia, who has been charged with war crimes by the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone. Why has the United Nations Security Council failed to reinforce this demand with a mandatory resolution under Chapter VII? The United Nations Commission on Human Rights must be replaced with a stronger human rights council, with membership barred to nations with poor human rights records.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the United Nations must return to its roots. It must reform a stagnant bureaucracy. It must sweep away a dysfunctional committee. It must focus on an active United Nations parliamentary assembly, a good governance and democracy promotion unit. It must become the three pillars: peace and security, justice and human rights, and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reform of the UN is indispensable, as it is the only multilateral organisation able to take up the gauntlet of the challenges of the new era effectively and successfully. Part of this process of reform will involve reviewing the number of members on the Security Council and its scope and the means and adjusting them to meet the new challenges. The only possible way of solving its problems is to adopt an integrated approach, which takes economic, social, development, security and human rights dimensions into account.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that efforts to reform the UN and the common security and institutional reforms aimed at promoting the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, closely complement one another. I therefore welcome the development ministers’ decision creating resources for this purpose. Successful realisation of the aims set out in the Millennium Development Goals is crucial for Europe in a globalised world. Reducing poverty, effectively eradicating starvation and meeting drinking water needs are all vitally important issues and postponing efforts to find solutions is not an option. The dangers are imminent and complex; successful implementation of reforms is more urgent now than it has ever been. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to see – not only here in Parliament but also in the Commission and the Council – that the general outline of a reform of the UN’s instruments assessing human rights is emerging and, moreover, that it corresponds to the work now being undertaken, by which I mean the package proposed by the UN Secretary-General and also the action plan which has just been submitted to Kofi Annan by the High Commissioner, Mrs Louise Arbour. These are extremely interesting approaches which, moreover, are echoed in the excellent report by Mr Laschet.</p>
<p class="contents">The transformation into a permanent council is obviously a revolution in the UN’s system of human rights. Why? Because it will provide us with a body able to apply permanent pressure on countries violating human rights, and, as we have just said, these violations are a permanent threat to security, development and peace. That is an absolutely vital reform. With regard to the increase in the resources available to the High Commissioner’s office, I believe everyone is in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we shall also have to look at the substance of the activity of this Council and at the way it works: in that area, the reference that the European Parliament’s report makes to peer group assessment – namely assessment by other countries – which is a transparent, just and equitable appraisal system for all countries, helping to avoid the charge of double standards, appears an absolutely fundamental one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to achieve a broad consensus between the different groups and delegations on such a complex issue as the reform of the United Nations. This reform involves many important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I will restrict myself essentially to three aspects. Firstly, the need for effective multilateralism in order to deal with the problems of the international community. No single country or single group of countries can say everything, but rather we need a multilateral approach, and multilateralism requires representative and effective institutions. Hence the importance and the need for a reform of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the reform of the United Nations Security Council, the body that is essential to maintaining international peace and security. Its representativeness must be increased and its operation improved, but I do not believe the best solution to be the so-called ‘model A’, that is to say increasing the number of permanent members, an idea which I believe to be rather anachronistic.</p>
<p class="contents">One essential objective clearly taken up in Mr Laschet’s report, is that the European Union itself should sit on the Security Council of the United Nations. This objective is entirely consistent with the idea of a common foreign and security policy, and it will be even more so if the constitutional treaty enters into force. But if the model that is finally accepted in New York is that of allowing new permanent members, I believe that the new seat should be for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it particularly striking that, at a time when so much is being said about a common foreign and security policy, or a future foreign affairs minister, this issue, surprisingly, is not being debated in the Council of the Union; the European Union's presence on the United Nations Security Council is not being debated in the Council and, today, the representative of the Council – I do not know if he is listening – appears not to have mentioned this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the fundamental importance of the reform of the United Nations Organisation, and in particular of its Security Council, I believe that it should be approved on the basis of the broadest possible consensus. A reform of this significance should not be implemented on the basis of just a two-thirds majority, because that is not reasonable. A greater consensus is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am pleased that the report stresses the fight against terrorism and, in this regard, I will not just emphasise Resolution 1373, but also the importance of assisting the victims of terrorism. Resolution 1566 has also taken a first step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to improve and to make progress in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

New international problems and challenges threaten world peace and stability. The international system is governed by the omnipotence of the United States and its unilateral perception of how to resolve international problems. The legitimising role of the UN has been reduced, while its efficacy and credibility have been dangerously weakened. Mankind needs a new, democratic, multilateral system which will express contemporary geographical and political realities. That is why the reform of the UN system is a necessary precondition to a world of peace, freedom, democracy, growth and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the UN Secretary-General and his proposed reforms are a bold response to the challenges of our times. The report by Mr Laschet also moves in this direction. However, no reform will be able to achieve its objective unless the UN regains its lost credibility as regards the application of its resolutions. Crucial resolutions on peace and stability have not been applied on the pretext of serving the current international economic situation and the interests of the major powers. Up to now we have been witnessing selective sensibilities in the application of UN resolutions and I think that this is a serious omission in Mr Laschet's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that a strong and effective United Nations is for the benefit not only of the European Union but also of the international community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We can support many of the proposals in the Secretary-General’s report. As I have stated, our priorities are to secure greater success in the achievement of the Millennium Goals. We are equally committed to seeing progress in the field of post-conflict situations and, therefore, we support the proposal for a peace-building commission as an instrument that will fill an existing gap between post-conflict situations and long-term sustainable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment to human rights is unwavering and the proposals on the table for a human rights council will get our full support. Equally, we will support the creation of a UN environmental organisation, which will further consolidate the central focus of our actions in the field of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">On climate change, we believe that the summit should call for more collaborative efforts to achieve the objectives of a UN climate change convention. The summit should endorse the UN Secretary-General’s proposals to ensure concerted global action to mitigate climate change and develop a more inclusive international framework for climate change beyond 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wholly endorses the contents of the UN Secretary-General’s report on the proposal for a comprehensive convention on terrorism and calls for Member States to agree a definition of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Secretary-General rightly underlines in his report that the accumulation and proliferation of small arms and light weapons continue to threaten the international security, human safety, as well as socio-economic stability. The summit should echo the UN Secretary-General’s appeal for consensus on the legally binding convention on the marking and tracing of small arms and to expedite negotiations on an instrument on illicit brokering and the supply of arms. The Commission further hopes that the summit will lead to the start of negotiations on an international arms trade treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal to set up a democracy fund, this could provide added value. It would make a real difference if it were used to jointly identify key priorities, general programming and to provide political guidance for those eligible countries seeking to strengthen democratic practice. Work now needs to be undertaken to facilitate the emergence of a consensus on the modalities of this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission underlines the need to restore the political stature of the General Assembly, asserting its role as the main universal deliberative body. The Commission is also particularly interested in the ECOSOC reform. We support a radical reform to render the body more operational and would like to see its role in all the pillars of sustainable development reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members raised the issue of Security Council reform. This is clearly an important and central issue. However, it should not be an issue that hampers our ability to take actions in a range of other areas that I have highlighted. I have again noted your repeated appeal for an EU seat on the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me state that reform of the United Nations is not an exercise in institutional change for its own sake. Our aim is to enhance the ability of this global organisation to meet the challenges of the 21st century in the interests of meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations. Seeking to consolidate the areas of agreement that exist between Parliament, the Council and the Commission further enhances our chances of achieving sound results in the reform of this important body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Council will take account of the suggestions, ideas and proposals emerging during this Parliamentary debate and also contained in this draft report. The Presidency will obviously communicate the essential aspects of this debate to the future Presidency, because the European Union must now define its position clearly in advance of the September summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, as many of you have said, that the UN is an essential building block of a globalised world. To solve the world’s current problems, we need a strong and effective multilateral system. It is for that reason that this reform must not be reduced to a handful of details or a few national interests. The European Union is best placed – or should be best placed – to show that multilateralism provides the answer to problems which can no longer be solved on a purely national basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to come back to the proposal concerning a fund for democracy. The United Nations human rights system needs root-and-branch reform. Too often – and we have discussed this on a number of occasions – developments which are almost absurd occur in the Commission on Human Rights. For that reason, to restore greater credibility to the protection of human rights within the UN system, reform is absolutely essential. And I believe that this is yet another area in which the European Union can be at the forefront of reform, encouraging it and achieving positive results and solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
