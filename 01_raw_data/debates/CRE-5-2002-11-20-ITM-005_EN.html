<p class="contents">The meeting reflected the intensity and depth of the cooperation between the EU and Russia. It showed that this cooperation is now entering a new phase; the framework for the strategic partnership has been laid down, and now it remains to flesh it out with practical actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there was a major problem, which has been discussed many times in Parliament, that is, Kaliningrad. Consensus was reached on a joint declaration regarding transit between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia. The agreement represents a balance between the interests of the candidate countries, Russia and the EU. The fact that a solution could be found to the problem confirms the strength of the cooperation between the EU and Russia; and at the same time the EU asserted that it attaches the utmost importance to respect for the sovereignty of the candidate countries and effective border controls on the EU’s external borders. We stood firm on the principles that Lithuania is a sovereign country and that it has as much right to join cooperation on Schengen as all the other candidate countries. This is something that was respected, even by President Putin. Consensus was reached, and I can add that President Adamkus of Lithuania, too, accepted the agreement which was entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">Consensus was also reached on a joint declaration on the fight against terrorism. This was a key point for both parties. The summit condemned terrorism in all its forms. The declaration and the accompanying cooperation plan are indications that cooperation between the EU and Russia on this point is moving on from an exchange of information to practical cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, consensus was reached on a declaration on the situation in the Middle East, which confirms the existing consensus between the EU and Russia on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a frank debate on the situation in Chechnya. The parties were agreed that the conflict cannot simply be regarded and treated as a problem of terrorism and that a political solution is the only way to lasting peace, stability and development in the area. I know that Commissioner Patten has already spoken of the extraordinarily open debate which took place.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will monitor developments closely. Both sides must respect human rights, and the EU must insist that those who do not are brought to justice. The EU will also demand that the international community be given the opportunity to provide the urgently needed humanitarian aid to Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional conflicts, particularly the one in Moldova, were also discussed. It is important to maintain that there are no geographical restrictions on the scope of the political dialogue between the EU and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union stressed the need for progress on the economic and legal reforms in Russia in order to ensure Russian membership of the WTO. In addition, the need for Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and the Energy Charter was emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I am able to call the summit a success, with a constructive dialogue in all fields. The cooperation between the EU and Russia has entered a new phase in which no topic for discussion is ruled out; and that will be to the advantage of both parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the European Union/Russian Federation Summit that took place on 11 November in Brussels succeeded in producing an understanding, as you already know, on the issue of transit between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are also aware, as a result of the discussions held at the May Summit in Moscow, the EU had agreed to carry out a review of the matter, taking further into account Russia's concerns about unimpeded travel of Russian citizens throughout the whole territory of the Russian Federation, including Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">In the relatively short time between the two summits, the Union completed a comprehensive review of the situation. Following a communication from the Commission in September, this review formulated a new position on Kaliningrad transit issues, which was adopted in October by the European Council meeting in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel discussions with both Russia and Lithuania, the Presidency and the Commission managed to develop ways and means to ensure that the vital interests of all parties concerned would be respected. In addition to Russia's legitimate interests, the EU was very much aware that any arrangements requiring further definition could not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania – a future member of the Union – or carry negative implications for Lithuania's future accession in full to the Schengen regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the European Union must adequately protect its borders at all times, a task for which it was essential to respect the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is confident that the understanding reached at the Brussels Summit strikes the right balance between these parameters, making it possible to resolve the issue of Kaliningrad transit in a manner which is acceptable to all parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already started work to prepare for the implementation of the understanding reached at the Summit. Time is short and we are fully aware of the need to launch preparations without delay in order to meet the deadline of 1 July 2003, when Lithuania will introduce the new regime for Russian rail travellers crossing its territory. We are confident that by then the conditions will be in place to allow the introduction of simplified travel documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that resolving the issue of Kaliningrad will allow us to substantially deepen and accelerate our cooperation with the Russian Federation in a number of important areas. Among these, the European Commission regards justice and home affairs as particularly important. Indeed cooperation with Russia on issues such as the fight against organised crime, illegal migration, drug trafficking, women trafficking and child pornography among others, is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, Russia confirmed at the Summit that the agreement between Europol and Russia will be rapidly concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Russia and the European Union will immediately launch negotiations with a view to concluding a readmission agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Summit also produced a joint statement defining areas for further cooperation in the fight against terrorism, which is a clear priority for both sides. We intend to increase the exchange of information in a number of relevant areas, as well as to deepen cooperation against terrorism in multilateral arenas and in regard to the provision of assistance in this field to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important issues were discussed at the Summit. The on-going conflict in Chechnya featured prominently among these. In this regard, the European Union raised its serious concerns over Chechnya. I would like to assure you that the well-established position of the Union on the matter was put forward to President Putin in quite clear terms. While expressing its support for Russia against terrorism in all its forms, the Union explicitly stated that the fight against terrorism cannot be conducted at the expense of basic human rights. This is also valid for Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union raised again the problem of unimpeded and safe access for humanitarian workers on the ground in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the EU urged the Russians to promote without delay a political solution that provides a framework for lasting peace, stability and reconstruction in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Summit we also had a good discussion on a number of international issues, including the Middle East, on which we agreed a joint statement.</p>
<p class="contents">We reviewed the situation in Afghanistan, as well as the need for Iraq to comply fully with UN Security Council Resolution 1441. We also exchanged assessments regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we reviewed the situation in Moldova and Belarus. Russia has already agreed to the withdrawal and destruction of ammunition in the breakaway region of Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU stated that it is essential that this takes place rapidly in order to promote a solution to the conflict which continues to impede the development on Moldova, which is now the poorest country in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We also made it clear that we expect Russia to use its influence on the government of Belarus to adopt a more positive approach towards democratisation and respect of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic side, progress was less marked, except for the change in the EU anti-dumping regulations, which now accord Russia market economy status. In addition, the Summit endorsed progress reports on the energy discussions and on the concept of a common European economic space.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also raised a number of its commercial concerns, including the discriminatory charges levied by Russia for European aircraft flying over Siberia.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU pressed Russia to confirm expectations of early Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and to commit itself to conclude a long-delayed agreement on the clean-up of nuclear waste in north-west Russia, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR).</p>
<p class="contents">I trust most of you are already aware that the 11th EU/Russia Summit will take place in St Petersburg, in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the city. Taking this into account, Russia has invited all EU leaders to this special summit, which should serve to deepen our bilateral cooperation with Russia even further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group advocates a stronger strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, because we are convinced that peace in our continent is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain a strong and effective European Union and an effective and democratic Russian Federation. We also recognise the progress that Russia has made in recent years in overcoming the legacy of the Communist era. We are, however, amazed at some of the circumstances surrounding the Brussels Summit. This negative view really needs to be aired here. It concerns both Chechnya and Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Chechnya, I would like to say that we are constitutional states and Denmark is also a constitutional state. It is the indisputable right of the Chechens to hold a peaceful conference in Copenhagen if it is their wish to do so. I do not wish to criticise the presidency for the fact that the summit ended up being held in Brussels. But I believe that we need to be courageous and not always give in when our partners in talks put pressure on us and demand concessions. On the contrary, we need to stand firm.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of resolutely fighting terrorism, because terrorism is an obstacle to the peaceful coexistence of peoples. We very much declare war on any form of terrorism. However, we also believe that the war on terrorism should not be deprived of its legitimacy by surrendering human rights in its name. That is why we are demanding that the war on terror should go hand in hand with a global ethic based on human rights. What this means in practice is that the human rights of the Chechen people should not be sacrificed at the altar of the war on terror, necessary though that war may be.</p>
<p class="contents">I was extremely surprised by what I read in the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span> of 13 November. Russia's President Putin was reported as having responded to a journalist that ‘if you want to become Islamic radicals and are therefore willing to be circumcised, than I invite you to come to Moscow. We are a country of many different faiths, and we have excellent doctors. We would recommend carrying out the operation in such a way that nothing grows again’. That is typical of the way human rights are breached in Chechnya. I would be very pleased, Mr President, if in future the issue of Chechnya could be addressed in writing in the communiqués issued following these summits. I have not been able to find a single word about this in the communiqué, even though reporters told me that Mr Rasmussen championed this cause, and Commissioner Patten also informed the Committee on Development and Cooperation about this. However, this should also be included in the conclusions of a summit of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to Kaliningrad. I read today in my local paper, the <span class="italic">Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung</span>, a well-written article entitled ‘Russia offers little hope. People of Kaliningrad expect much from EU, but little from Moscow.’ I naturally welcome the fact that the thorny issue of visas has been resolved. However, the people in the Kaliningrad region or ‘<span class="italic">oblast</span>’ – and this is the heart of the matter – look far more towards the West than they do towards Russia. Igor Rudnikov, the managing editor of the courageous newspaper <span class="italic">Novye Kolyosa</span>, which means ‘New Wheels’, has said that the rhetoric and fuss issuing from the Russian Federation on the subject of Kaliningrad has only damaged its cause. They look towards the capitals of Europe – to Paris, to Warsaw and to Berlin. The central issue is that the Kaliningrad region should be developed so that it does not become a no-man's-land in Europe, but becomes part of a development axis running through Poland and into the Baltic states. It would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda, so that these human problems can be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office, and the Commission, to act with this in mind. If you do that, you will have our support too.</p>

Now we are starting to reap the rewards of bringing down the Iron Curtain. Now too conditions in Russia are stabilising, except with regard to certain aspects, which I shall return to. This being the case, we are in favour of establishing a Common European Economic Space. It will be an important step on the path we are developing towards normal relations with Russia. The Union has said Russia is a normal market economy. That is saying quite a lot, perhaps, although Russia is on the right track and this is consequently a step towards accession to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember that one consequence of enlargement is that the border between Russia and the Union will lengthen and that is very significant. Russia will lose its markets to some extent in those countries joining the EU, and that is something we also have to take into consideration to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the heated controversy over Kaliningrad was resolved at the summit. I do not think this was perhaps the major problem it sometimes appeared to be in the debate. We are also responsible for developments with regard to Kaliningrad, and I agree with Mr Poettering that we have to be able to provide help and assistance and work together to improve conditions for the people who live there.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that the war in Chechnya is a problem for Russia, for us and for the Chechen people, who are at the centre of the war. We believe that human rights must not be violated under the pretence of the fight against terrorism. This has to do with Russia and it also has to do with other countries that we have been praising here or which are perhaps our older allies. The fight against terrorism has become an umbrella that allows violent actions to be carried out by countries against their own and other citizens. This must not be allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Chechnya is being raised because we have a delegation leaving for Chechnya, and I am its chairman. There has been a development regarding this in that today, after lengthy negotiations, I received a letter from Dmitri Rogozin of the State Duma, inviting us to go there on 20 January. It had been suggested that we should go in late December, but that is Christmas and we asked if the visit could be rescheduled. This being the case, January seems a good time to go, if the members of my delegation agree: all this has happened so very recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is a big partner for us. Trade between us is worth approximately 25 billion dollars a year, while the figure for the United States of America is just 3 billion and for the former countries of the Soviet Union only just over 10 billion dollars. We are thus a giant trading partner of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner in what state the energy dialogue can be in if all of a sudden Gazprom decides on a gas pipeline – coolly decides to build a gas pipeline. The energy dialogue between us has not been very visible in this project. We are the world’s largest energy area, and the energy issue is therefore very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should furthermore like to mention the state of the press in Karelia and elsewhere too in Russia, where there are pressures that are simply not acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For some reason, when we give our opinions we often stress in particular Russia’s various problems instead of concentrating on its positive achievements and the potential that exists in future cooperation. Many things are obviously better in the Union but we also have problems Russian Members of Parliament could seize on if they so wished. To their credit, they do not. I do not mean that we should keep silent, for example, about environmental problems, lack of democracy or human rights violations in Russia. It is a matter of how we weigh things and how we handle them.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now it is important for us to discuss the effects EU enlargement will have on cooperation between the EU and Russia. We have been able to resolve problems to do with Kaliningrad’s status but there is still much work to be done. In this regard the ball is very much in Moscow’s court. We need them to be unbiased in their approach to implementing changes in Kaliningrad so that there is investment there coming from the rest of Russia and abroad too. Now that the border between the EU and Russia is to lengthen we must make renewed efforts to develop northwestern Russia and boost cooperation in the border regions. The Union must make a more serious effort than it has until now to engage in programmes of cooperation in the Barents Sea and Baltic Sea regions and furthermore direct substantial economic resources at those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question of current importance is the development of cooperation in the area of energy. That would enable us on the one hand to help Russia develop its energy economy and protect its environment and, on the other, safeguard our own energy economy. It is in this spirit that progress must be made in the area of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the EU must focus special attention on basic repairs of railway tracks in Lithuania. For that purpose we have to provide adequate financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is believed in the European Union that the need for energy grows at a rate of 1% a year. The intention is to meet the extra demand by increasing the use of natural gas. Russia is an important partner for the EU because the reserves of gas in the North Sea and North Africa will run out in twenty years or so. The EU’s demand for gas has to be met with exports from the east.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation on the issue of energy is not progressing satisfactorily. The best form of cooperation would be if pipelines were built linking Russia and the EU. If the pipelines go through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine there will be needless waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Early this week Gazprom announced, as Mr Paasilinna stated, that it was constructing, on its own, a gas pipeline from the Shtokmanovsk deposit in the Barents Sea to Central Europe. That is good news, as in that way the EU countries’ increased demand for the use of energy is satisfied. It is bad news if looked at from the point of view of cooperation. The EU is not now a party to the project and it will pay in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Adherence to market conditions in the EU will not solve the problems of the energy market. Liberalisation of the market makes it impossible in practice to finance new investment by means of long-term supply contracts. If those who need gas shared in the costs of its delivery onto the market that would improve reliability of supply and over a time span of twenty years that is what will be the most important thing.</p>
<p class="contents">With Russia we have to speak about factors that unite us. One issue that separates us is the civil war in Chechnya. We all hope for a peaceful solution to the war. At the same time we note that at the summit attended by leaders of the EU and Russia no demands were made by the EU regarding Chechnya’s independence as a state. The region is therefore regarded as a part of the Russian Federation. Human rights cannot be trampled on in Russia using terrorism as an excuse, nor in the United States of America either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is about Kaliningrad. I believe that enormous efforts have been made in this regard in recent months. The Commission and the Council had meetings with Mr Rogosin, the presidential envoy, and with Minister Rasov. At the instigation of our President, Mr Pat Cox, they also had parliamentary support at two meetings with our Polish, Lithuanian and Russian colleagues. I believe that we can be satisfied with this and my group is satisfied with the result achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Chechnya. Yes, it is clear that the events in the Dubrovka Theatre must of course be condemned, and as Chair of the Russia delegation that is what I immediately conveyed to Mr Lukin. We can condemn it and we do of course also want an explanation of the gas that was used, of the circumstances in which action was taken and of how the forces of law and order acted. I believe that some additional clarity about this is required. We also note that there is a tougher stance on the part of the Russians with regard to Chechnya. Nonetheless, the European Parliament has taken the lead in this debate in recent months. We have said that we are in favour of negotiations and talks, because a military solution is not going to produce a result. I find that our Russian friends, President Putin not least, have now adopted an extremely rigid attitude and since 11 September have put the whole struggle in Chechnya in the context of the war on international terrorism. I believe this to be an aberration. Only holding talks, even with the people around Mr Maskhadov, will lead to a genuine solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to express my concern here about the general state of human rights in Chechnya. Amnesty International has recently published a report about the freedom of the press, about the lack of religious freedom and about the general human rights situation in Russia. I believe that this warrants some attention on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would draw your attention to an environmental problem. At the beginning of October my delegation visited Murmansk. There we studied the nuclear inheritance of the Soviet Union. All the local people and all the local authorities there are asking for a multilateral nuclear environment programme. I should like to ask the Commission and the Council very clearly how things stand with the negotiations on this treaty? It is absolutely essential that there is one, otherwise no one can take responsibility for clearing up the nuclear inheritance of the Soviet Union properly. I should like to put this question to you Commissioner and to you Mr Haarder, for which my heartfelt thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an appalling decision in that the toll in human life was so great. It goes without saying that the members of my group wish to pay their respects to each and every one of the victims. This hostage–taking incident has also somewhat changed Parliament’s standpoint on this issue. Prior to 11 September, the situation was simple. On the one hand, there were the Chechens, a people fighting for their freedom and their right to self–determination. On the other hand, there was the tyrannical Russian regime. There was also the United States who, for their own ends, also defended the cause of the Chechen Muslims.</p>
<p class="contents">The investigation into this attack and ending of the hostage situation has shown that there are very close links between the Chechen movement and international Islamic terrorism. Chechnya has become a base camp for international terrorism and the trafficking of arms and drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you not to repeat the mistakes made at the time of the war in Kosovo. On that occasion we allowed ourselves to be led by the media and the statements made by the United States applauding the attacks on the Christian Serbs who were threatening the brave Muslims of Kosovo. Since then, we have seen, especially in France, that Kosovo has become not just a route, but also a base for Islamic terrorists operating in Western Europe. These terrorists have been active in France and Germany in particular. The latest arrests made in France, Germany and also recently in Belgium confirm this. I call on you therefore not to make the same mistake with the Chechen movement, and to stand firm against Islamic terrorism. My group does of course support the accession of Russia to the European Union. Russia is a country with a Christian tradition and culture. The history, geography, customs and traditions of Russia mean that it clearly belongs within the European Union. Russia has much to contribute and her membership would help the process of renewal within the European Union. I think that we should support Russia as it develops a culture of democracy and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How to deal with the ambivalence of Moscow’s policy? This ambivalence is manifesting itself in openness to the outside world and growing uncommunicativeness at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Putin’s paradox can, harrowingly enough, be tellingly illustrated by the Chechen tragedy. The just war on terrorists is combined here with the dreadful disenfranchisement of an entire population group, including the muzzling of its own media on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the EU do about this constant mutual bloodletting on Russian territory? Little more, but also certainly no less than always having the Chechnya question on the agenda in the consultation with Russia. I was therefore pleased to hear the statement by Commissioner Patten of Tuesday 12 November. He said that the Danish Presidency had raised the situation in Chechnya both fully and forcefully at the summit with Russia. In this context I would ask Council and Commission to offer political backing to the OSCE mission in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish Council and Commission persistence in the search for a well nigh impossible political settlement between Russians and Chechens. At the same time the EU must be candid in raising with the Kremlin other evil manifestations of Putin’s political system of a 'guided democracy'. The list of Russian taboo topics of parliamentarian Yavlinsky can provide good service in this regard. Think for example of the attempts of the powers that be to silence agreeable politicians and other citizens or of corruption in the upper reaches of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stand up for full respect on the part of the EU for Lithuania’s sovereignty in the transit agreement concluded for Kaliningrad and the Russian Federation. Serious doubts about this have arisen on the Lithuanian side. I spent last week with an EP delegation in the United States. I took soundings in the press where I heard very many concerns from Lithuania about this settlement. Council and Commission, are these serious doubts on the part of Lithuania justified? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are we aiming for the stability of Budapest in 1956 or the stability of Prague in 1968? We have heard Mr Marchiani try to pull the wool over our eyes. He delivered a completely racist, Christian fundamentalist speech, representing the antithesis of what we must do. What is currently at stake in Russia is democracy. The Chechen problem is being used by the oligarchs in Russia to bolster their power bases and specifically to prevent democracy from becoming a reality in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a problem we do not want to confront. We did not want to confront it either in the case of Kaliningrad. When all is said and done, we could have come up with more ambitious solutions. We could have responded positively to Mr Putin’s proposal for a common market, not just in goods and money, but also in people. We could have said yes, Mr Putin, on condition that you resolve the question of Chechnya, on condition that you resolve the nuclear question and on condition that you resolve the question of the freedom of the press in Russia. That would have been entirely possible. However, we prefer to let ourselves become obsessed with oil pipelines and with discussions with technocrats. The real issue is saving Chechnya, in order also to save the soul of Russia. Today we are moving in exactly the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Mr Paasilinna if, since he is going to Chechnya on 20 January, he could find an extra seat on the aeroplane and take Commissioner Nielson with him. After all, I together with Mr Posselt and others, have been calling for Mr Nielson to visit the country for around two years now. I would also like to ask the President–in–Office of the Council, since he claims the exchange of information on terrorism has improved, how we stand regarding the Deputy Prime Minister of Chechnya. The latter is still in prison in Denmark, even though the Russian charges against him appear to be absolutely derisory and entirely without foundation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately we can now talk of constructive cooperation. We mention the northern dimension in this regard and all kinds of things that are in our mutual interest. We hear a great deal about this from our Finnish fellow MEPs in particular. Rightly so. There is also talk of the pursuit of a common European economic area. I think that this is a good thing, because with the enlargement of the European Union with so many Central European countries on the horizon, we must also look at what is happening on our borders. Do we have a clear policy with regard to adjoining areas, in particular Russia, the Ukraine and Moldova? We are going to have to devote some attention to this, so that we can continue to talk of regular cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of Russia are mostly very clear to us. We have done our utmost to help bring the Kaliningrad problem to a successful conclusion. The Lithuanian Government in particular was of course very interested in this. I am therefore very pleased that President-in-Office, Mr Haarder – we did not expect anything else – in particular underlines the sovereignty of Lithuania. Yet I would also really like to know how things are going with the development of the solution of the Kaliningrad problem? If I have read the situation correctly, it is all tied up with an enormous number of technical issues. At a certain point Schengen comes into play and really we have to know at any point whether or not the arrangements with Russia are a hindrance for Lithuania. I think that we must make this a priority. Russia is large enough, it can look after itself. You have to stand up for a small country, especially if it has a history with Russia that is as tragic as that of Lithuania. I should like to see a situation in which, ultimately and in all fairness, the guidelines that continue to apply permanently give priority to Lithuania's sovereignty and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to raise the problem of borders. The borders with Russia and for example Latvia. On this point ratification continues to be a long time coming. The reason why is unclear and at delegation meetings in Moscow we are told that it has no priority. This too is, in my view, another example of a big-country strategy: ‘the small fry will just have to wait’. I think that we as a European Community are well past this kind of thinking and that we must make clear to Russia that this authoritarian approach, even to the outside world, – internally it is already far too prevalent – comes across to us as very distasteful. If we help Russia with all kinds of problems, then Russia itself must be constructive too and say: okay, we are going to solve a problem with this candidate country immediately, we will ratify. In fact nothing else needs to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the problem with Chechnya. It is very clear that even in Russian politics they are at a complete loss as to what to do. It has indeed changed to being first and foremost a war on terrorism, but the damage for the civilian population is so disproportionate that we cannot take it lying down. I think that it is very important for military people, possibly those from NATO and Russia, to talk about it – to ask why are you doing that, is there not another way – and in particular to keep hammering away with the message that a political solution will in the end be the only one that can finally bring peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the case of Kaliningrad, it is pleasing that a solution acceptable to the European Union and to Russia has been reached. I hope the Lithuanians will also find the agreement satisfactory. Clearly, without their support, the agreement will be meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on the economic, social and political future of Kaliningrad. The agreement includes a commitment by the European Union to provide technical and financial aid to the Russians to promote the economic development of the enclave. This is a very important commitment. The destabilising effects for the whole region of the under–development of the enclave would be frightening. Kaliningrad’s naval shipyards and all the maritime activities there are currently suffering from a severe economic downturn. As a result, the enclave is likely to remain a good location for all types of trafficking, and dissent among its population may develop. Commissioner, I implore the European Union to do everything possible to help the region recover from this stagnant state which is also threatening to engulf Poland and the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other issues, I fully support our partnership with Russia. But clearly this commitment should not make us deaf and dumb on the question of Chechnya. Candour is a mark of friendship and Europe takes a strong stance of talking about Mr Sakharov in the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this difficult and tragic issue, there is clearly an enormous amount of work to be done with Russia. This includes work on Foreign Affairs, and the Common Security and Defence Policy. Unlike Mr Marchiani, I do not envisage Russia’s accession to the European Union. This is not the problem. As regards security and defence however, though we are working hard on the relationship between Russian and NATO, we should also start to reflect on the relationship between European Security and Defence Policy and Russia. We will discuss this matter on another occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are right to condemn the clearly disproportionate brutality of the methods used by the Russian authorities. However, we would get a better hearing if we did not ignore the real basis of Moscow’s reaction, which does not pertain solely to Russian concerns. The Russian Government is invoking its legitimate right to defence against attacks within the territory of the Federation. The country is being attacked by forces which, after stirring up a belief in Chechen separatism, intend to capture this sentiment and use it to the benefit of a type of radical Islam that is bringing terrorism right to the heart of Moscow. Who would dare to deny that Chechnya has become, after Afghanistan under the Taliban, one of the best training grounds for international Islamic terrorists who pose a threat to us all? Those who persist in denying these realities or who talk about them in relative terms are leading us towards deadlock.

I do not regard the murder of Muslims as a Christian duty. Terrorism, arms trading and drug trafficking also exist in other states, including our own Member States. Nevertheless, no one is suggesting that we should simply be bombing those Member States, including Mr Marchiani's own country. We need to be clear about the fact that people are indulging in emotional manipulation here. We are certainly not talking about a war on terrorism – we are talking about the creation of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chechens have been the victims of colonial persecution for 150 years. They were deported by Stalin. In the modern era, they have twice been overrun in brutal wars serving oil interests. Mr Putin's election campaign was one of the factors underlying the intensification of the second of these wars, which is still being waged.</p>
<p class="contents">So it has to be said for once and all that this is not a war on terror, it is more likely to encourage terrorists! We have a share in the responsibility for all this. So how have we reacted? The beautiful city of Copenhagen was boycotted by Mr Putin simply because the Danes exercised their democratic right to respect freedom of expression and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">So why did the Council then shift to Brussels? Commissioner Nielson, who is responsible for humanitarian issues in Europe, has not announced that he is to visit Chechnya, but rather that he is to attend a banquet for Heads of State and Government in St Petersburg. Let me say this very clearly: it makes me sick to be part of a Europe that is sipping Crimean champagne in St Petersburg while people are bleeding to death on the streets of Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Europe's most noble task is to advocate freedom and human rights. Yesterday we were celebrating the presence of our Baltic colleagues in our midst for the first time. Our colleagues from the Baltic states also owe their freedom to a Chechen, General Dudayev, who at that time refused to take part in the bloody repression of the Baltic freedom movement as he had been ordered to do as a Soviet officer!</p>

The Prime Minister of Denmark, Mr Rasmussen, had the courage to remind Mr Putin that the conflict in Chechnya did not amount to a terrorism problem and that a political solution was needed. Mr Putin gave a frosty reply and that was as far as it went. When Europe had offered premature and uncalled–for congratulations on the use of banned chemical weapons on the hostages and hostage–takers in Moscow, it was not the moment to issue reprimands. Furthermore, the President of the Council had doubtless had his hands tied by his peers.</p>
<p class="contents">No more was said about possible sanctions, which had been on the agenda since the summit of 1999 with Mr Yeltsin. Since that time, the situation in Chechnya has dramatically worsened, and the civilian population of the region is powerless in the face of the actions of the special forces. Torture, rape, extra–judicial executions and disappearances are everyday occurrences. Those responsible for violations of human rights and war crimes act with complete impunity. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, why have you not, together with the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission, at least followed up the specific request of Amnesty International to allow access for the humanitarian organisations to Chechnya, under threat of sanctions? Why have you not insisted on establishing free access for the Red Cross to those people who are rotting in prisons or holding centres, the gulags of today? Now that all our partnership agreements contain a clause on human rights, why has international humanitarian law yet again yielded in spectacular fashion to the strength and reason of State? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is the situation in Chechnya? On the one hand, we have a people who are fighting for their freedom, and on the other we have a colonial power which is using every available means of oppression and repression on a continual basis. The article that has just been read to us demonstrates the state of mind of the Russian leaders. Furthermore, while the Council and the Commission state that human rights in Chechnya have been discussed, I think this is far from the case. Let us not mince our words. What is going on now in Chechnya is genocide. Entering into negotiations with the Russians when this genocide is being committed is questionable, even if legitimate interests in the Baltic States and elsewhere should be protected. The assertion that we have to come to an agreement on the fight against terrorism is also open to question. The terrorism of despair of the Chechen fighters is in no way comparable with the State terrorism practised by Russia.

<p class="contents">After 70 years of the Soviet system, the future development of Russia is of course problematic, based as it is on a combination of deep-rooted structures and a new system. As I see it, the position of the European Union can only be to provide active support during this massive restructuring process. Over the next few decades, Russia will be Europe's most important energy supply partner.</p>
<p class="contents">Even during the Soviet era, Russia has always been a key player in stabilising world peace. That should not blind us to the problems in Chechnya, and those problems cannot be denied, but we have to see the overall picture. Furthermore, Europe does not have the right to treat Russia differently from other countries that are also in breach of human rights. I would like to stress once again, for the avoidance of any possible doubt, that this by no means justifies the situation in Chechnya, but we do need a careful analysis of that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to proceed on the basis that only a fair and open partnership between equals can succeed in the long term. The most important steps to be taken are systematic actions to build trust, to establish fair trade relations, and to reinforce Russia's economic development and provide any form of assistance that will promote the development of democracy, a process that has still not been completed after 12 or 13 years. It must be evident that without a stable, democratic and strong Russia world peace will be at even greater risk than it already is at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Haarder called the solution ‘balanced’, but I regard it as being, above all, balanced in terms of allowing Russia to save face and to please our own Schengen purists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has told us that the European Union needs to secure its borders at all times and in all places. That is a statement that even Erich Honecker could have signed up to, because transit through Lithuania will be more difficult for passengers than transit from West Germany to west Berlin via East Germany was in the old days. I think the European Union should be hanging its head in shame to have agreed to this thirteen years after the wall came down.</p>
<p class="contents">The practical difficulties will be a matter for the Lithuanian border authorities and the passengers themselves. Russia will be able to exploit this situation for other purposes as well, because of the enormous potential for technical problems and the likelihood that those affected will complain.</p>
<p class="contents">Have you ever considered that the eastern end of these journeys is not in Russia at all, but in Belarus, a country that has not been mentioned in these discussions at all? So what would happen if relations between Russia and Mr Lukashenko deteriorated to the point that Mr Lukashenko decided to exploit this situation? The whole arrangement would then not even be worth the paper it was written on.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also easily imagine what will happen in practice when an application is made for a facilitated rail travel document. In an extreme case someone in Khabarovsk in eastern Russia would have to give his address with his ticket in the hope that everything would be forwarded to a central Russian office which would then send everything on to the Lithuanian authorities, which would in turn have to process everything on time, so that when the passenger on board the train arrives at the border the Lithuanian border official would hopefully have the transit permit for that passenger with him. However, it is all too easy to imagine how well all this will work in practice, given the administrative capacity of the Russian authorities. I therefore urge you to keep an eye on this problem and not to imagine that we can now assume that it has been dealt with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I almost saw myself in the role of one of those Members of Parliament who demanded that now the Presidency should do this and that and pointed out that the Council had failed to do this or that or the other. That is how it should be, and I would call upon Parliament to continue to hold the Council to the democratic ideals on which Parliament is based.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not, moreover, continue now with a ‘but’. I will continue with an ‘and’, because I have always understood our common approach to mean that we must also be good neighbours, that we must also be able to solve common problems and that we must also have sufficient contact with each other to allow a dialogue, so that we can say the things that need to be said. I would say to Mr Posselt that if we are to move Russia in the right direction in the area of human rights, it is necessary for there to be a place where we can have a dialogue with Russia. This place existed a week ago in Brussels, but it makes no difference whether it is in Copenhagen or Brussels. We had the dialogue, the necessary things were said and Mr Patten was a witness. Mr Nielson has confirmed this today. The Council said exactly what had to be said to Russia, on the subject of Chechnya too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Zakayev, who is currently in custody in Denmark, I should like to tell Mr Dupuis that the Zakayev case is being dealt with entirely in accordance with the principles of the rule of law, in accordance with European extradition rules and in accordance with our established policy on combating terrorism. Not a single political decision has been taken in respect of Mr Zakayev. Everything has been done by the book. We have followed the textbook of democracy to the letter. The same applies, moreover, to the holding of the conference which created the conflict between Denmark and Russia. This conference was held because it is a democratic right to hold conferences. That is not something we can prevent, and we stand by that right, just as we have held firm in all other aspects to our democratic ideals. I completely agree that, as has been pointed out by Mr Poettering and many others, we must not sacrifice human rights on the altar of combating terrorism. Of course not. It was precisely this, moreover, on which the dialogue with Russia at the summit was based. We are in agreement on the fight against terrorism, but we are not in agreement in our appraisal of what has gone on, and is still going on, in Chechnya, and this was stated very, very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution was successfully found to the Kaliningrad problem, and one which respected the sovereignty of Lithuania and Lithuania’s right to accede to Schengen. The fact that we managed to solve a problem in the region around us in this way is very important for enlargement. Moreover, with regard to the yet to be ratified border agreement between Russia and Lithuania, I can state that, during the summit negotiations, the Presidency made it very clear to Russia that we are assuming that the border agreement between Russia and Lithuania will now be signed. So nothing was forgotten. There was nothing that we should be ashamed of. Everything was done by the book of democracy. Fortunately, the dialogue was maintained, and the problems which were to be solved at the summit were solved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to end by saying that it is important for Parliament to hold fast to its ideals and take the Council to task if there is a risk of our not doing the same. Stick at it. I do not, however, think that there is any reason to admonish the Council or the Presidency for the way in which they handled this very difficult summit which has just taken place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a good clear description of the reality. It is also a reminder of what the Union needs to do and how it needs to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened very carefully to all the contributions. I shall repeat what I have said before in Parliament when discussing the problem of Chechnya. The division of responsibility in the Commission is quite meaningful. If we were not careful in defining the tasks and responsibilities of the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid, we would blur the whole issue, especially when it comes to ensuring that access to delivering humanitarian aid is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am very careful to give a clearcut definition of my responsibilities as the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid. If I were to fall into the temptation of engaging in political discussion on this issue, I would reduce the legitimacy and efficiency of my efforts to protect the access of humanitarian workers in places like Chechnya. That is why I resist becoming involved in political manoeuvres or political projects, even if I might sympathise with them. It is for the Commissioner on external relations to do that, and it is important, especially in this case, for us to be careful in our use of the instruments and commissioners available. If, with my responsibilities, I fell into the temptation of politicising, we would reduce the weight of our efforts and our attempts to insist on having access. I have, on the other hand, publicly criticised the Russians on that issue, and do so quite frequently. I feed elements of this kind into every summit that we have with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately there has been no progress. There are the well-known issues of work permits for humanitarian workers, the ability to use the UN VHF radio system which is important for the safety of people moving around there and the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons in the camps. All these issues are raised over and over again, and I would repeat my call for Parliament to view the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid as keeping to a relatively narrowly-defined remit, which is what I do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have others who deal with the political side of the discussion. This is important not only as regards Chechnya, but also for many other places. You will see the same approach when we talk about accessing victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Being a political animal myself, I will not engage in a more substantive political discussion on the nature of the conflict and these other issues, however tempting that might be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna and a few others raised the question of the energy dialogue with Russia, and especially cooperation in the area of natural gas. It is quite difficult to rush into a conclusion in an area where negotiating realities also have to reflect who engages commercially and who does not. The issue of the gas pipeline negotiation is a long-term one. There is a risk of contradictions between establishing the very long-term basis of those kinds of deals and the liberalisation of the gas market inside the Union, to which we would give priority. Against that background it is not that simple to accommodate the desire shown by the other side to have a very long-term, stable kind of contract as a basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it would not be for us but for the companies and the market to establish such a contract, which is another reason why things are not that simple. Furthermore there are other interesting strategic issues concerning the geopolitics of Europe's energy supply in the years to come, including issues relating to natural gas, and it is no surprise that this is a complicated and demanding question. For tactical reasons I would urge some caution as to how Members of Parliament pursue this issue. It may be worthwhile and important to ensure that we have long-term cooperation and supplies from Russia, but it is also important not to jump into negotiations that ultimately meant our not getting as good a deal as everyone thought we should. I would therefore advocate caution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards Mr Oostlander's clear question about whether Lithuania can join Schengen after this agreement on Kaliningrad, this has been one of the defining points in our approach to negotiations. This is why we find the solution in which there are no complications of that nature to be a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by commending the cooperation between the Council and the Commission on this issue. This is one of the areas in which we have been quite successful. It is also something which has been duly recognised by Lithuania and which has certainly demonstrated to the other candidate countries that we take their situation seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been going on for three years, we have been asking him to go there for three years but he never responds to us. This is an intolerable situation!
