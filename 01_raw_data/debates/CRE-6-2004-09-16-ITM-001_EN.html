This is because of the continued existence of an unjust and disgraceful law that takes no account of social reality or of the reasons why women turn to abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this backdrop that we have been seeing significant acts of international solidarity towards Portuguese women, including the recent attempt by the Dutch ship belonging to the organisation ‘Women on Waves’ to enter Portuguese territorial waters. It was disgracefully refused entry by the Portuguese Government, thereby preventing debates from being held and information on sexual and reproductive rights from being provided.</p>
<p class="contents">This intolerance reached ridiculous proportions when the Portuguese Government sent two Navy corvettes to surround the Dutch organisation’s ship. Following declarations made at the Cairo and Beijing United Nations Conferences, Parliament, in its resolution of 3 July 2002, recommended that governments should develop high-quality national policy on sexual and reproductive health, in conjunction with pluralist civil society organisations. Ample information should be made available on effective family planning methods, with high-quality access to all forms of contraception, which does not happen in Portugal. It was also recommended that, in order to safeguard reproductive health and women’s rights, voluntary interruption of pregnancy should be legal, safe and universally accessible. Governments were called upon to avoid taking legal action, under any circumstances, against women having illegal abortions. Again, this does not happen in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, we feel that the European Commission cannot turn its back on what is happening in Portugal, on the appalling hypocrisy and violence against women, which clearly encourages back-street abortions and pushes women on the lowest incomes and those with the poorest access to information into the most dangerous activities for sexual and reproductive health. We therefore hope that the European Commission will show solidarity with Portuguese women, that it will oppose intolerance and will fall into line with positions that Parliament has already taken in this regard. In so doing, it will promote the actions needed to raise awareness of defending and promoting women’s rights and dignity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, too, ‘Women on Waves’ are having an impact. Why is this so?</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the end of August, the Portuguese Government has been preventing the Dutch vessel <span class="italic">Borndiep</span> from entering a port on the west coast of Portugal. This Dutch vessel belongs to the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation, which Portuguese women’s organisations have invited to Portugal to give out information on abortion, contraception, and the RU 486 abortion pill, which is the least traumatic method of terminating pregnancy. The Portuguese Government evidently regards this as putting Portuguese women in grave danger, or else it would not have taken this drastic course of action. The Portuguese Government thought it was worth violating two of the European internal market’s fundamental freedoms: the right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a serious political incident; never before has the right to freedom of movement been violated for purely political reasons. We in the Socialist Group cannot accept this, and so we are asking the Council and the Commission what they are proposing to do to prevent this unprecedented occurrence in the history of the European Union from being repeated. I see this as an important question and one that has to be put to the incoming Commission right now, and we want to see it made perfectly clear that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The incident has had repercussions right across Europe; it is all over the media, for there is of course more to it behind the scenes. The fact of the matter is that women in the European Union really are having their freedom curtailed, and we cannot accept the creeping rollback that is going on here. We see from the Treaties that, at the level of the nation state, the freedom of movement may be restricted only in the case of a danger to public safety, from terrorism for example, but is that what is at risk in this particular instance? Is women’s health threatened by an epidemic? If so, perhaps it is an epidemic of free thought or of the freedom to decide; I adopt this rather ironic tone in view of the very different views expressed even in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, where the Christian Democrats wanted this case to have a lower profile. I do think, though, that it is a very important one, and one that needs to be dealt with here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We want all women in Europe to know how to get access, in the safest possible way, to contraceptives and terminations and to information about them and the safest ways to use them and then to be free to decide for themselves what they want. It is clear that this case, at the end of the day, not only has the most profound effect on individual women’s right to choose, but that it is also and at the same time a highly political act, and that is why we cannot accept the violation of two of the four basic freedoms. Although we want Mr Barroso to say where he stands on this, I would also ask Commissioner Wallström to add her weight to the women’s case. Mr Barroso is presenting eight women as Commissioners and claims to want to give women a better future, but it may be that the substance of his programme will suffer a setback. That is something we want to prevent, and that is why we are having this debate today. I hope that both the Commission and the Council will clearly state their positions on this. If they do not, then I think the <span class="italic">Borndiep</span> or the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation ought to write a thank-you letter to the Portuguese Government for giving us the opportunity to discuss the principle whereby women must be able to decide freely when and how they want to receive information on the termination of pregnancy and what they do with it, and, at the end of the day, also have a free choice as to when and how they want to have a child. This is a fundamental issue, and it needs to be discussed in this House.</p>

This happens, of course, in the debate in this House, but also in the media, where the discussion about the reproductive rights of women, which are not recognised in all EU countries, is once again cranked up. This is exactly what the ‘Women on Waves’ association wants. Consequently, any politician who speaks for or against this organisation and wants to enter into the fundamental debate about abortion, does complete justice to the objectives of this women’s organisation. I myself can be brief about this. I fully support this House’s position, as set out in Mrs Van Lancker’s report, which is that, although a termination should not be decided upon lightly, women should, have the right to decide in favour of a safe, lawful termination.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what was said by the majority in this Parliament, as indeed it is what is said by ‘Women on Waves’.<span class="italic"> </span>Portugal, however, has refused to allow the ship access to the port, which is bizarre. ‘Women on Waves’ is not engaging in illegal activities in Portuguese waters; what it is doing is providing information about a topic which is not to the government’s liking. This may well be the thin end of the wedge. Indeed, it is only a matter of time before Greenpeace<span class="italic"> </span>is refused entry to ports if it says something not to the government’s liking, and that we cannot accept. The Portuguese used the argument that the ship <span class="italic">de Borndiep</span> is a threat to public health. Is the European Commission of the same mind? Mr Bot has already stated that refusing a ship entry on those grounds is not justifiable. Does the European Commission share his opinion? Access should not, however, be denied on the grounds of public order either. Information activities are not violent. They take place in the privacy of the ship in the spirit of dialogue and respect, so the government’s tough response is unfounded. The ship has now crossed the border again, just as some 10 000 Portuguese women do every year in search of the treatment they need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE Group), I wonder whether the Portuguese Government’s decision to prevent the Dutch ship from entering its territorial waters was a breach of international law. I also, however, view it as a ban on the provision of care to fellow European women.</p>
<p class="contents">Although in my opinion the ‘Women on Waves’ campaign is conducted in a somewhat provocative manner, I still believe that it is fundamentally legitimate. The association’s campaign is concerned with two women’s rights which to my mind are indispensable: the right to health and the right to dignity, both of which are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In many Member States these rights have been defended for decades by women who fight to win governments over to their legitimate cause. This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not here to reprimand those Member States which have chosen to restrict, prohibit or punish the practice of abortion, but I believe that the event of which I am speaking today should be an opportunity for these Member States to reopen the debate on this difficult issue. Women often have to take the serious decision to end a pregnancy on their own, and it is always a time of great distress. It is a choice which is never made casually, but in all conscience, and accusations of guilt or even criminal guilt are not the right response. Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward. Incidentally, repression is a godsend to illicit businesses which exploit ignorance and social weakness. This type of network should have no place in our Europe of freedoms. It is the duty of the European institutions to set an example in this field and to ensure that individual freedoms are respected. If the Commission fails to take a clear stance, it will be seen not just as a social injustice for these women, but as an unacceptable setback for their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that the problem does not affect women alone. I find it a pity that there are so few men in our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who have realised that we must unite to defend our ideas and to demonstrate our commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty as Europeans is to use our judgment and compassion to help the women of our Member States confront their problems. This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE/ADLE Group) calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt a clear and democratic position.</p>

Mr President, the Commission has been following developments in this situation. According to the information available to the Commission, 'Women on Waves', together with other persons and organisations, appealed against the refusal of entry of the vessel into Portugal. On 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra adopted a decision on the appeal which has been the subject of a further appeal by 'Women on Waves'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would recall the principles of Community law in connection with the free movement of persons. European citizens are entitled to have access to the territory of other Member States in accordance with the various rights to freedom recognised by the EC Treaty, subject to the conditions and limitations provided for by that Treaty and its implementing provisions. Member States can restrict this fundamental right enshrined by Article 18 of the EC Treaty solely when this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Where a Member State adopts a measure refusing entry to its territory based on one of these grounds, it must respect the general principles of Community law. It must respect fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of expression, and in particular the proportionality principle, as well as the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">When decisions are taken on grounds of public policy or public security, the conduct of the persons in question must pose a real and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society. Only the diseases or disabilities referred to in the annex to Directive 64/221/EEC can justify refusals to enter Member States on grounds of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Directive 64/221/EEC, decisions refusing entry or ordering expulsion from the territory must be notified to the person concerned, informing him or her of the grounds of public policy, public security or public health upon which the decision has been taken. The person concerned must be able to lodge a complaint against this decision. It is for the Portuguese national courts to rule on the validity of the decision, while respecting the general principles of Community law and the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not yet received a complaint about this incident from the representatives of the 'Women on Waves' organisation. However, it intends to contact the Portuguese authorities to obtain more detailed information on the facts related by the honourable Members.</p>

In the case in question, a Portuguese court ruled that the Portuguese Government had acted within the law. Under due process of law, the judiciary is independent of the other authorities. The Portuguese Government does not give orders to the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot give a ruling on voluntary termination of pregnancy, nor, indeed, on the legality of a judgment. Voluntary termination of pregnancy is a matter of exclusive competence for each individual Member State. Portuguese law is not substantially different from that of most Member States and was approved by a democratic parliament. In a recent referendum, it was decided that it should not be changed. I understand that pregnant women must be able to make their own decisions in this delicate matter, but we must also respect the fact that a majority of citizens expressed a different view. This is a majority and we operate under due process of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform you, Commissioner, that no member of ‘Women on Waves’ was refused entry. They had previously enjoyed complete freedom of movement and expression in Portugal. They had no restrictions – they spoke where they wanted to, with whom they wanted and gave the interviews they wanted to give. That was until they helped people to obtain and take medicines that are prescription-only because of their potentially harmful side effects. One woman, whom I understand to be a doctor, confirms that she obtained this drug over the counter in a Portuguese pharmacy, in violation of basic public health rules. Given that these allegations have come from a doctor, this is very serious. Long-standing members of the Portuguese Medical Association and of the Portuguese Pharmacists’ Association have protested.</p>
<p class="contents">Limiting freedom of movement in the European area is intrinsically linked to protecting public health and to preventing the practice of illicit acts. What actually happened was an incitement to clinically unassisted – I repeat, unassisted – abortion, with the aim of exploiting the fact that many pregnant women are needy and ill-informed, encouraging them to break the law purely for propaganda purposes. This really is an appalling violation of human rights, which Parliament should condemn outright. Mr President, you would have been better off, and the Conference of Presidents would have been better off, having this debate aborted.</p>

This is an issue that concerns not only Portugal and women; it is also an issue for men and women throughout the European Union. It also concerns the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When it refused the Dutch vessel entry into its territorial waters, the Portuguese Government breached not only international law, but also Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Citizens of Europe and defenders of women’s rights have been prevented from entering a European country and treated as though they are criminals. The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent when men and women belonging to a non-governmental organisation from one Member State, invited by an NGO from another Member State, with the aim of jointly promoting awareness-raising activities on sexual and reproductive health, have been compared to drug traffickers, illegal fishermen or smugglers. The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Government cited compliance with national law and protection of public health, yet which Portuguese laws were breached, when and how? The law-breakers here were not the women’s organisations, but the Portuguese Government, which violated women’s rights. There is also no substance to the alleged danger to public health, since no one aboard the vessel was carrying an infectious disease. The Lisbon government made its decision, an incorrect decision, based on assumptions and hearsay in order to intimidate women who support voluntary termination of pregnancy. The Portuguese Government prevented the free movement of European citizens within the European area, by means of deliberate obstruction, in order to prevent an awkward debate for the ruling coalition. Stranger still, while the vessel was in Portuguese waters, it was watched at all times by two Portuguese Navy corvettes. Should Portuguese warships be used to intimidate citizens who are peacefully and courageously promoting their causes? In a democracy there is no such thing as the crime of expressing your opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in Portugal with the ‘Women on Waves’ ship must not be allowed to happen again and must not go unpunished. If it does go unpunished, it will set a worrying precedent that may lead to restrictions of the rights, freedoms and safeguards that belong to all of us, the citizens of Europe.</p>

Portugal is said to have at least 20 000 illegal abortions per year and to have some of Europe’s highest figures for teenage pregnancies. Midwife Maria do Ceu, who carried out illegal abortions, was sentenced to seven and a half years’ imprisonment. Portuguese women are not alone in being refused the right to free abortion. Irish, Maltese and Polish women are in the same position.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have rights over their own bodies, and the right to sexual and reproductive health is part of the Convention on Human Rights, ratified by all the EU countries. States that have ratified international conventions must also respect those conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the debate is about the measures actually taken in connection with ‘Women on Waves’. When it became a member of the European Union, Portugal promised, as a state, to respect the four freedoms of movement. The exemption invoked is that of national security. In this case, I wish to invoke both Community law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea. I do not believe that Portugal is so unstable a country that six people in a boat can jeopardise national security. Consequently, the proportionality principle may not be invoked in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Portugal has broken its promise to the EU, other Member States and the European people when it comes to the freedoms of movement. I would ask MEPs to reflect upon how it would look in Europe if other European governments were to ponder which groups of citizens did not share their own views and were then to call out their navies to prevent these groups from entering their ports. Such a situation would clearly be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its action, the Portuguese Government has challenged not only women and others throughout Europe who wish to defend human rights and respect for international conventions, but also the whole European idea, together with freedom of movement in Europe. I thus wish to call upon both the Commission and the Council to take clear action on this issue without delay.</p>

<p class="contents">We are not debating why Portuguese women have to go to Spain to have abortions that could be carried out in Portugal, or why those without the means to go to Spain have back-street abortions, which is a matter of concern for Portuguese public health. This is not what we are debating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not even because Portuguese women still have to go to court to expose their pain and their intimate details in a humiliating ordeal. No.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we discussing why the Administrative Court of First Instance took the decision that it took in Portugal. No.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are actually discussing here is whether it is legitimate in Europe – because this is a European issue – for a military corvette to confront three men and three women on the high seas and prevent them from reaching a Portuguese port, when they were on a legal vessel and were providing a medical service that has been duly legalised in another Member State. This is what we are debating. We are debating whether it is possible to create a European project when the Portuguese State, in defence of the vilest and most controversial law in Portugal, is able to, and gives itself the right to, send a military corvette to the high seas against a civil vessel. It is this and nothing else that we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graça Moura may, therefore, wish all he likes to abort this debate, but he has no way of doing so. The Commission’s response was an encouraging one, which, while falling short of what was required, ensures that the kind of incident that took place recently will continue to be met with firm opposition by the many people in Europe who believe that the free movement of people and ideas is an integral principle of the European project itself.</p>

This is of particular significance at a time when over 50 million children are killed each year in their mothers’ wombs, which amounts to genocide on a considerably larger scale than the millions of Holocaust victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people the world over are asking whether there can be any greater degeneracy and bestiality than the murder of a child in its mother’s womb. A mother ought to be the embodiment of love and affection, and her womb should be the safest of places. Unfortunately, however, it can become a grave.</p>
<p class="contents">The killing of a child in its mother’s womb is not a human right. What kind of rights do ‘Women on Waves’ therefore wish to defend, if the leader of this organisation was not even entitled to practice medicine in the countries where they landed, and nonetheless prescribed life-threatening hormonal medication to induce early abortion, as well as publicising drugs which can terminate pregnancy and carrying out abortions?</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether twenty-first century Europeans really do desire a freedom allowing free rein to people with disturbed personalities, no conscience, higher feelings, dignity or compassion, that have of late been described as immature, in order to not awaken dormant consciences. After all, such people were formerly classed as psychopaths.</p>
<p class="contents">Rational and responsible doctors and researchers have observed with horror the manipulation and degradation of science taking place in laboratories and under the microscope. It amounts to thinly disguised terrorism inflicted on the weakest of children, and the creation of modern extermination camps.</p>
<p class="contents">In what way does the killing of defenceless children in their mothers’ wombs differ from the bloodbath in Beslan? Against the public’s wishes, the death penalty for the most serious of crimes has been abolished in Europe. Yet at the same time, and invoking this same public opinion, the death penalty for the most defenceless and innocent is being advocated. Upon what basis does the European Union venture to assume the right to decide on the life and death of human beings?</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of the adoption of such an approach to an issue involving the most fundamental of values and human life that Europe and all of Western civilisation is now increasingly at risk of collapse. Anyone who cannot see this has been blinded and deafened by political correctness. I have the highest regard for the Portuguese authorities, and commend them on preventing this ship of death from entering their territory. Finally, I call for the sanctity of life to be respected from conception to a natural death.</p>

One would appear to be obvious in this House, namely whether an EU Member State has the right to prevent an act from being committed on its territory if it is a crime under the laws of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue seems to me to be completely clear-cut. We want a Europe in which each country is able to lay down laws for its own territory and use every means to uphold those laws. In my opinion and in that of my colleagues, the Portuguese Government was fully entitled to prevent a ship bearing death and crime from entering its territorial waters and reaching the Portuguese coast.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this debate has a further dimension too, as a speaker from the Left quite rightly noted. That Member was absolutely right to point out that this debate is also about the way in which contemporary Europe treats unborn children. The fact that in many countries the fundamental right to life is not respected is deeply shameful for today’s civilisation and today’s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Praise God, since the recent European elections there is an increasing number of Members in this House with the courage to proclaim that unborn children do have the right to life, in Europe and the world over. It is a very welcome fact that there are now a great many more people in this House who do remember the words of our Saviour 2 000 years ago, when He said: ‘As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me’.</p>

<p class="contents">This ship, nicknamed the ‘abortion ship’, has been transformed into a floating clinic in order to supply the RU-486 pill, known as the ‘abortion pill’. It should be noted that this pill is banned in Portugal and hence not sold in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is, we do not believe that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has the necessary competence to deal with these two subjects, one relating to the application of international law and the other, concerned with abortion and contraception, relating to morality, ethics and religion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to note that in its resolution of 3 July 2002, Parliament called on the Member States to conduct information campaigns on sexual and reproductive rights, and not to encourage women to use abortion as a method of contraception.</p>
<p class="contents">With regards to this extremely sensitive issue, there is no place for politics, to say nothing of politicking, especially if the issue is used purely to win votes, as appears to be the case here. The European countries and their governments have the right to ensure that their cultural, ethical and religious sensitivities are respected, and they have the necessary authority to do so.</p>

As you know, it has already sailed to Ireland and Poland. According to the agenda, the boat is Dutch. That is incorrect, although it does sail under the Dutch flag. The boat is an initiative by a handful of Dutch women, and in view of that, I am amazed that it features here on the agenda. We are not going to discuss boats by Greenpeace or other organisations. I set great store by a debate on ethical questions, such as abortion and women’s rights, and indeed applaud it, but the discussion is specifically about this boat and what happens on it. I think that what happens on this boat is unfortunate. Attempts are being made to change the law in Portugal, but in a democratic culture, this is hardly the way to persuade another country to do this. Interference of this kind from abroad in respect of Dutch legislation in the areas of drugs or euthanasia, for example, could equally meet with the same wave of protest in the Netherlands. We should enter into a debate with each other in a different manner, not like this. I also consider this action to be irresponsible. Given that the boat sailed to Ireland without permission, it did not even comply with Dutch legislation, which is already very lenient in this respect. Following the trip to Poland, a heated debate arose about the use of the non-approved abortion pill, and there are now discussions about the aftercare that cannot be provided. ‘Women on Waves’ has now published on the Internet a way to induce a termination yourself using over-the-counter medication, and this is accompanied by a word of caution about the gigantic risks that this entails. The boat then leaves again a few moments later. I do not think this the right way to go about things, not even to promote what you want to promote. Countries think differently about matters such as abortion. We must enter into a debate with each other about this. I am all in favour of that. We may be a community of values, but not in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since this right aims to enhance and share knowledge for the benefit of women’s health and sexual rights, it is perfectly compatible with the Lisbon strategy. It was not the intention of the ‘Women on Waves’ ship to export the Dutch achievements in the area of abortion to Portugal, but rather to give Portuguese women and men objective information about their sexual rights. It is up to them what they do with this information. Two years ago, by means of a resolution following a report by Mrs Van Lancker, this House called on governments to provide objective, scientific and clear information about sexual and reproductive health. This also included the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and the risks of dangerous terminations performed under inadequate circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">By foiling the activities of ‘Women on Waves’ which aims to provide information, the Portuguese Government has not given evidence of having taken this House’s resolution seriously. Although the ship has now left Portugal, ‘Women on Waves’ has indicated its intention of returning in time for the forthcoming elections in Portugal. This could provide the Portuguese Government with a good second chance to act upon this Parliament’s resolution and to demonstrate that it does not want to deny its citizens the right to information. Commissioner Wallström, can the Commission ensure that best practice in the area of providing information about women’s reproductive and sexual rights will again be put more firmly on the map, and will it take concrete steps in this respect, for example in the form of organising a conference on this topic in Lisbon?</p>

I cannot judge if this is so, because I do not know exactly what activities were taking place on board that ship and, indeed, I know nothing of Portuguese law. I believe the case will be judged by a court that is competent to do so. However, I also believe that this was a provocative act by 'Women on Waves' and an attempt to undermine the principle of subsidiarity because, while in this House we may or may not agree with Portugal's stance on abortion, we must at all times recognise its right as a democratically elected government to make these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House on Tuesday, I listened carefully to one speaker after another talking about 'respecting the dignity of difference, respecting the right of Members to hold different opinions and showing tolerance to those opinions'. Indeed, the President, Mr Barroso, said: 'nobody has a monopoly on truth' – and that includes the Portuguese Government and 'Women on Waves'. We must all have respect and tolerance for different opinions, different laws and the right of any state in the EU to legislate and enforce that legislation within its borders. Surely, in this House, we must recognise and value that principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my understanding that the EU and the Court of Justice have stated that laws relating to abortion are dealt with at national level only and that the EU has no competence in this area. So, while the Portuguese Government has no monopoly on truth, it has competence, which it considers was threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a parallel: we in Ireland have introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace. This extends to Irish ships. If a Portuguese or Dutch citizen were to smoke on board an Irish ship in international waters, that would break Irish law. It is not the same situation, but this example helps to illustrate how complex and sensitive these situations are and how the principle of subsidiarity should apply at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to accepting responsibility for their own lives, women have had responsibility for their children’s lives too. In spite of the fact that women have been empowered in legislation etc for such a long time, we women are clearly still incapacitated when it comes to taking decisions concerning our own bodies and sexuality.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no other way of interpreting the Portuguese Government’s action in connection with ‘Women on Waves’. The action taken by the Portuguese Government is not only a declaration of women’s incapacity but also breaches the European Parliament’s resolution to promote information campaigns concerning sexual and reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want only to debate women’s rights, but also to put children at the centre of this debate. Taking a different view from certain participants in this debate, with their lack of empathy and understanding, I wish to say that children’s lives are too important simply to depend upon chance. Children have an unrestricted right to be welcomed into the world with the prospects of a good life.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not usually go in for conspiracy theories, but I cannot refrain from reflecting upon whether the action taken by the Portuguese Government does not in large part have to do with the fact that it is precisely women and women’s own organisations that are at issue. If this vessel, that is the subject of our debate, had been called ‘Men for violence as a means of conflict resolution’, would it, I wonder, not, in all likelihood, have been permitted to enter the port?</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council and the Commission are serious in their talk of a women’s Europe, they cannot refrain from taking issue with the action taken by the Portuguese Government. We must now side with women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is beyond me as well why we here in the European Parliament are debating an issue between Portugal and an action group sailing under the Dutch flag. The case is to be judged by a court, and it does not fall within this Parliament’s remit. The whole issue would therefore seem to be resolved, were it not for the fact that this case is not only judicial in nature, but also moral. Since when does the attack on legislation of another Member State fall under the scope of the free movement of persons, goods and services? That is precisely what is happening here with ‘Women on Waves’. In Last Saturday’s <span class="italic">NRC Handelsblad</span>, this organisation urged people to back the fight for free abortion in Portugal. That is quite different from providing a service, and in doing so, this organisation is showing its true colours. That is indeed something completely different from providing information on board the <span class="italic">Borndiep</span>. I would note in this connection that the Dutch Public Health Inspectorate is launching an inquiry in order to assess whether the activities by ‘Women on Waves’ are permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Progressive activism is testing the boundaries of the law. <span class="italic">Abortus provocatus</span> is not automatically accepted in the Netherlands either. At the time, only a narrow majority was in favour of a statutory regulation to make <span class="italic">abortus provocatus</span> possible. Even to this day, a large minority is having great difficulty accepting this abortion legislation, coming from the standpoint that life is worth protecting. The Netherlands need not show the way in this matter. I should like to address the questions that my fellow Members have put to the Commission. They state that the Commission should take steps on the basis of Community law. Article 28 of Community law stipulates that there should be free movement of goods and services. Article 30 of the same Community law stipulates that free movement of goods should not apply when common decency, public order, safety and public health need to be protected. It follows that Portugal has every right to refuse an action ship access, even if a Portuguese organisation has invited that ship to be there. It is therefore quite a privilege for the EU Member States to still have the right to adopt their own policies. In that light, it is a sign of little respect if attempts are made, via European legislation, to prove that the progressive line is right. The Portuguese Government should be praised for considering the unborn life worthy of protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that in the majority of European countries abortion has only been permitted in the past few decades, and even now it is not permitted in all of them. I rejoice that there are still countries where it is not permitted. Even those supporters of abortion who believe that it is a matter of moral indifference must be aware that this discussion will give rise to much opposition. They must appreciate that for a great many people in Europe and for a large majority of people in many European countries abortion is a serious crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Both supporters and opponents of abortion on demand are aware that it is one of the great problems of civilisation. If this problem is reduced today to a debate on whether Portugal has violated the right to information or the right to freedom of movement, this will be an exceptional display of hypocrisy, ill will or stupidity.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of this House, we cannot allow ourselves to act as villains or idiots. Consequently, if this House begins to consider this problem in terms of the freedom to travel and the freedom of information, it will send out the worst possible message about itself and contribute to the collapse of civilisation, and thus also the collapse of the European Union and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember that in many European countries, including Ireland, Malta and Portugal, abortion is not permitted. Abortion is not permitted in Poland either. The ship belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ association also sailed to Poland, and its presence in Poland was an incitement to criminal behaviour. Members of this association who entered Polish waters should be aware that if they ever enter them again, they will not only have to answer for the crimes they committed previously, but they will also, I hope, encounter restrictions and not be allowed into Poland. I believe the Portuguese Government took the best possible decision in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, Portugal did not act under Community law. This point has already been made. Portugal is a sovereign state with independent courts.</p>

<p class="contents">I am not talking about the RU-486 pill, which, as in many EU countries, is not licensed in Portugal and which was being transported on the ship, but about the irresponsible acquisition and use of medicines that can be obtained in pharmacies, albeit subject to certain restrictions. The unbridled propaganda presents extremely serious risks not only to the right to life of the child that dies when an abortion is committed, but also to the woman, whose health may suffer severely, as documented in pharmacological literature on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is, furthermore, a waste of time, out of place and improper.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also offensive. I must say that frankly it pains me to see my country slandered abroad and it pains me all the more to see my compatriots taking a leading role in doing so, giving a distorted picture of the facts to those who do not know better, and seeking to caricature the people in question in a propaganda circus.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the greatest respect for the Netherlands, for the Dutch people in the European Union and for the Dutch Presidency, but we have our laws. We have always debated these issues freely without the need for such digressions. As we all know, we are a democratic and free country. Our laws are the fruit of our democracy. In other words, Portugal is not a colony of the Netherlands or of any other country, and less still, the target market of some opportunist group that comes along to educate the local population, as happened during the 1975 ‘cultural dynamisation’ and when the PREC (Ongoing Revolutionary Process) was at its peak. We practise respect and democracy; we demand democracy and respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested that freedom of movement was violated. This is ridiculous. Dutch women may go wherever they want to, as everyone knows. It is the boat that cannot go wherever it wants to. It has been suggested that freedom of expression was violated. This is ridiculous. We all took part in the debate and said whatever we wanted to at the time, just as on all other occasions. The only acts of violence committed were the extremist and intimidating language – laden with hate and intolerance – used by the supporters of the Dutch group’s nautical circus to condition the Portuguese people and dilute their rights as citizens, the bias on the part of the media, which was in thrall to the boat trip’s demagogical populism and the vandalism perpetrated at our party’s headquarters.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Portuguese Government acted within the law. The court found in its favour and this matter has nothing to do with the European Union.</p>

It has become clear that the Commission will request explanations from the Portuguese Government as regards the <span class="italic">Borndiep</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, at least one in four women has had a back-street abortion, which is, as much as anything, an extremely serious public health problem. That statistic speaks volumes; we cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand. How, therefore, shall we, the European Union, condemn these women? Should we have them arrested? What about those who terminate their pregnancy in London or in Badajoz? Should we close the borders? Should we keep them under constant European Army surveillance? Should we have all of the Portuguese newspapers that publicise foreign, or more specifically European, clinics carrying out safe and legal voluntary terminations of pregnancy confiscated?</p>
<p class="contents">What if the <span class="italic">Borndiep</span> were a train, or a TIR lorry? Would army tanks be stopping the train or the TIR from entering Portuguese territory, so as to make sure that there was no chance of the law being broken and so that the Portuguese people were not informed?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that, although the two Portuguese war corvettes were in permanent use, no military or civil authority ever asked to board the <span class="italic">Borndiep</span> and check for any potential dangers on board?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that the Portuguese Ministry of Defence’s only information had come from a series of media cuttings and not from first-hand observation?</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, it was important to know that the Commission clearly intends to ensure compliance with the Treaties. Otherwise, if Turkey accedes to the EU, the Commission will have to take military action in the case of a married Portuguese man moving to Turkey, having announced that he has a girlfriend there and who will therefore be committing adultery.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is crucial that action is taken at this time, so that we are not faced with the warped logic of ‘more of the same’, also in the EU. This is not a question of morals or of personal opinions, Commissioner; this is a question of legality.</p>

<p class="contents">Abortion legislation is indeed a national issue, but freedom of expression of opinion is a fundamental right of all European citizens across Europe.

In that light, the Portuguese Government’s blocking of information and debate is incomprehensible, and, as far as I am concerned, a disgrace for democracy.

An abortion is a catastrophe for the unborn child, who is killed. An abortion is a catastrophe for the mother, who is often emotionally scarred for the rest of her life. An abortion means failure on the father’s part, for he has often made off in a funk. An abortion is a failure on the part of the state and of society, which have not created the conditions in which life can be adequately fostered. For these reasons, we should deal with this issue very carefully and with a deep awareness of our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">States decide in different ways how this is to be dealt with by the law, or, to be more precise, in a democracy, it is the people who take that decision, and their decisions differ. What made Portuguese law what it is was not some sort of shadowy conspiracy, but the Portuguese people – who, in a democracy, decided that they wanted to combat abortion by restricting it, and, indeed, by the use of the criminal law. Poland and many other Member States do likewise, some of them very effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say yet again that this is a subject on which opinions can differ. I do, however, find it unacceptable to behave as if information were the point at issue. Not one Portuguese citizen, whether male or female, is not fully at liberty to seek out information about anything. Anyone would think that the Portuguese were ill-informed yokels. Portuguese men and women are extremely well informed and have access to every possible source of information. What is going on here is agitation and an attempt at undermining the law of a Member State and an important principle of the European Union, that being the subsidiarity principle, and the most important principle in our Charter of Fundamental Rights, the right to life.</p>

Women in Portugal need help and advice on abortion, sexual health and reproductive rights. I would remind this House that in most Member States abortion is legal. I would also draw your attention to the Van Lancker report, which has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are talking about abortion, which is accepted throughout most Member States of the European Union and has been accepted by this House. We need to be very clear on this. We also need to be very clear that illegal, unsafe abortions present not only danger to the women concerned, but danger of death. We have already heard from Mrs Madeira about the fatalities which take place in Portugal itself and I would like to remind all of you that every six minutes across the world one woman dies from an illegal, unsafe abortion. I put it to all of you that we have a duty to deal with this and put an end to this suffering and this toll of death.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to recognise that 'Women on Waves' is only called into countries when women's organisations in those countries concerned actually request it. We are not talking here about something being forced on people, we are talking about something being requested because there is a clear need and demand for it. We also need to be aware of the position on the free movement of people within the European Union, which is one of our fundamental principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by quoting from the Treaty on European Union: 'to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime'. This is what we are about. We are about basic human rights, and this is one of them.</p>

The political events which we are considering so diligently today have been the subject of wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. I should like to confirm that every member of our committee has been able without exception to express his or her views. The committee has devoted sufficient time to discussion of these events, even in a situation where we did not have sufficient information and in-depth analysis, especially with regard to the possible contravention of human rights, community rights or rights of freedom of movement or information. Despite completely open and lively discussions, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, in view of the divergent opinions expressed, was unable to reach a consensus on a common standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn to a more fundamental aspect, however. This goes far beyond political polemics and even the legal advisors do not have a clear solution for it. The following reflections are simply the reflections of a woman in solidarity with other women. I should like to point out that a woman who feels compelled to have an abortion never does so with relish. This often involves a situation where the woman does not believe she will be able to cope with pregnancy and childbirth and where it seems to her that, in this confused situation, she has no other option. This personal upheaval may be associated with extreme situations, when the woman is compelled to stop work, is deserted, raped or suffering from other physical or mental trauma or abuse in a family, economic or social environment. The situation today is a manifestation of the failure of a developed human society which is incapable of contributing to the needs of all human beings, including the poorest, smallest and weakest. We must work towards an internal stability pact, which will give people more trust in society, supporting inter-generational solidarity and enabling us to engage together in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Prioritising means mobilising all available resources – police, investigation and intelligence resources – and ensuring that the legal system is ready and able to take quick and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recommends that Member States strengthen all resources for this fight. Nonetheless, in spite of notoriously scant resources, Portugal has been diverting important investigation and legal resources into a different objective: punishing illegal abortion. The Portuguese police have been bugging the telephones of law-abiding citizens and of their family members or of medical professionals whom they suspect may be involved. They have spent years observing them and hounding them; legal professionals have spent years of working time – in an already overloaded, understaffed and poorly equipped system – putting women accused of abortion on trial. Taxpayers’ money is spent on criminal investigations into medical operations that Portuguese women can go to Spain to have, perfectly safely and legally. Women who have the wherewithal to pay can have these operations in Portuguese private hospitals disguised as other kinds of surgery. The many women who do not have the wherewithal have no choice but to have back-street abortions, where they risk their lives, and risk being arrested, taken by the police to hospitals, forced to have gynaecological tests and then put on humiliating trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The hypocrisy has now, however, reached new levels of insanity, with the ban on entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation. The Portuguese Government, the one that Mr Barroso has left, has sought to stifle information and debate on family planning, in clear breach of human rights, international law and Community law. It has done this by using totally disproportionate methods, police and even military resources, without hesitating to use warships. Resources have thus been diverted, once again, from important activities, such as the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, and observing vessels used in drug-trafficking that use Portuguese waters as a point of entry into the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Wallström – whom I welcome here today – has stated, the Commission is to seek explanations from the Portuguese Government. I should like to ask the Commissioner, in addition to the points that she mentioned, not to ignore the unjustified, excessive and almost obsessive use by the Portuguese Government of criminal, legal and even military resources in the fight against abortion and against providing family planning information. In so doing, they have removed the resources and the efforts that Portugal ought to be putting into EU crime prevention policies in the joint fight against international terrorism and organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I show my solidarity and congratulate the Portuguese Government for its courage and, why not, also its moral courage when taking this decision. It is not easy in today’s world with, pressures being exerted from every quarter, that one makes a bold stand and adheres steadfastly to the decision taken more so when knowing that one would not necessarily be popular by taking such a decision. I must say that I do not agree that the abortion issue should be raised in this Parliament for any reason except to put pressure on one country or another. I do not agree as all of us are aware that this Parliament has no power to decide or to legislate on abortion. In the same manner the Commission has no jurisdiction concerning abortion. This is a matter that should be decided at a national level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and every country should decide according to its circumstances and according to how its society looks upon such a sensitive issue. This means that, by raising this issue here when we know that this Parliament has no jurisdiction, all we are doing is mixing people up and creating total confusion, when, in fact, this is a clear issue and upon which there is no place for confusion. This confusion has even caused a number of countries, including Malta, my country, to seek clarification regarding this issue in the context of negotiations by negotiating a specific protocol regarding the abortion issue. The same was done by Ireland, and, if I am not mistaken, even Poland, not because there was any legal doubt about this issue but so that there would be certainty and all would have their minds at rest. Therefore whilst again congratulating the Portuguese Government that set an example to others, I appeal that we should not muddle people’s minds regarding this issue by entering into matters that do not concern us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am proud to stand here and defend a woman's right to choose. That is fundamentally what this is about. It is about choice. It is about informed choice. I find it sad that there are people in this House who want to imprison citizens and women, in ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about a fundamental freedom, with the focus on abortion, a highly emotive subject. It is easy for you to try and divert this debate, but it must not be diverted. It is about fundamental freedoms: freedom of information; freedom of movement; freedom of expression; and it is about intolerance. That is why I am proud to stand here and say that if we allow this to happen in Portugal, what happens when there is another government that has another view about opinions that are different from their own? What happens then? If we stand here and do nothing, we condone these undemocratic attitudes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard religion mentioned. I am very sad. I see the fingers of the Vatican all over this. Women need no lectures from men in frocks, telling them what they should do with their bodies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>

<p class="contents">I condemn the actions of the Portuguese Government and I urge this House to do likewise. This issue goes to the heart of Europe. Ours is a Europe based not on suppression of information or repression, but on fundamental freedoms and human rights. The actions of the Portuguese Government must not and will not go unchallenged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as I said previously, this is about informed choice as opposed to enforced ignorance. Therefore I call on the Commission to act in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties and the fundamental rights enshrined in those Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission has been informed by the Portuguese Permanent Representation in Brussels that the 'Women on Waves' association, amongst others, appealed against the decision to refuse entry of the vessel into Portugal. As I said earlier, on 6 September 2004 the administrative and fiscal court of Coimbra concluded that there had been no violation of Community law. This decision is the subject of a further appeal. The Commission intends to seek information on the precise motives and implications of the decision of the Portuguese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States enjoy discretionary powers to determine the scope of the concepts of public policy, public security and public health on the basis of their legislation and national case law. However, measures restricting freedom of movement adopted on those grounds must comply with the provisions of Directive 64/221/EEC, which limits Member States' discretionary powers.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already stated, the Commission believes that any Member State adopting a decision restricting the free movement of persons must respect fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, as general principles of Community law.</p>
