<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jillian (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the aim of this regulation is to ensure consistency in the rules for travelling with pet animals, commonly known as the pet passport scheme. It is a very welcome development and very important to the lives of many EU citizens who have, in the past, been prevented from travelling because they could not take their pet animals with them. The fact that the Commission has been able to bring forward such a proposal reflects the incredible success of the steps taken over recent years to control rabies. It is worth repeating the figures: cases among cats and dogs have fallen from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Member States started to adopt their own rules for the increased movement of pet animals, it became clear that a European system was needed to make it easier for pet owners and avoid confusion. I am pleased that Parliament's amendments, adopted in the common position, called for detailed information for consumers so that they can make the necessary preparations before travelling.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to some of the key issues. First, the legal base. Members will recall that this was one of the main issues at first reading. The Commission proposed a double legal base, whereas Parliament's view was that, since the main aim of this regulation was to protect public health, a single legal base should apply. However, following the receipt of the common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has accepted the double legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, trade. Once the Council has included measures on trade within the regulation, as requested by Parliament, the distinction between commercial and non-commercial movement is still not defined clearly enough. Under the Council proposal, the maximum number of five animals that can be moved under this regulation is fine. But if the purpose of the regulation is primarily to protect public health, then the number of animals being transported is not relevant. We have therefore tabled amendments deleting the maximum number.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, identification. Parliament previously called for ISO standard transponders to be used and for the owner's name and address to be included. The Commission and the Council proposals allowed for other types of transponders to be used, as long as the owner carried the means to read the information. As ISO chips are not available in all countries, the Committee on the Environment has agreed to remove the requirement for ISO standard equipment, but still wants the owner's details to be included. This would help combat trafficking in pet animals. We strongly believe that electronic identification is more effective, humane and reliable than tattoos and that, after the transitional eight-year period, only microchips would be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point relates to young animals. The Committee has re-tabled the amendments preventing the movement of animals under three months old without the requirements of this scheme. This would not be applicable to the United Kingdom, Ireland or Sweden, but it would apply to the other Member States. I do not believe that it is possible for the authorities to carry out proper checks on young animals, for instance ensuring that they have remained at the place of birth or have not had any contact with wild animals. This therefore leaves a loophole for trade in puppies and kittens particularly.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth point concerns the involvement of Parliament. Several of our amendments relate to Parliament's involvement in decisions such as the extension of the transitional measures for the three sensitive Member States and to comitology -retaining Parliament's right to be consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the OIE International Animal Health Code. The committee has retained the requirement to take into account the OIE Code when deciding on the health status of third countries in the scheme. This has been a subject of some debate. I am aware that the Council felt that the OIE Code would exclude large parts of the EU from free movement of animals, especially after enlargement. I also know that countries such as the United Kingdom are moving away from rabies-free status because it would exclude, for example, Canada and the USA, but the committee has decided to adopt a cautious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that each of these issues can be resolved without too much difficulty and I ask Parliament to support the position of the Committee on the Environment. I must say that I am disappointed that, despite my best efforts, an agreement could not be reached with the Council before the second reading and I am very grateful to the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, the representatives of the presidency and the Commission for their cooperation in our discussions over the past three weeks. I believe that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach and we will continue to do so in order to reach agreement as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am satisfied that the report reflects a general agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">The main differences between the original proposal submitted to Parliament at first reading and the common position we have before us today fall into three categories. First, we have the provision facilitating movements of young animals between Member States of equivalent status. Second, the provisions for reassessment within a period of five years of the specific conditions for movements to Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Third, provisions amending the conditions applying to trade to align them with the conditions applying to non-commercial movements – to accommodate the wish expressed by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report. They can be split into two categories – technical amendments and institutional amendments. I will begin with the nine technical amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1 and 6 may be the result of a misunderstanding. The setting of a maximum number of animals aims only to distinguish commercial movements from other non-commercial movements. It is not intended to be a dividing line between two different types of rules – the same rules would apply to commercial and non-commercial movements. So it would be incorrect to say that setting a maximum of, say, five would be any threat to public health. In effect, it means that once you go above five, the commercial rules apply but below five the rules set out in this draft legislation apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would result in a prohibition of movements of young animals under the age of vaccination between Member States other than the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, for which specific provisions exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of the discussion with the Council was that those movements of young animals have always been allowed, that they represent a negligible risk and that this flexibility must be maintained. Otherwise, the movement of these animals would be seriously undermined. Therefore, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 suggest the adoption of import conditions equivalent to those that apply to movements inside the Community for third countries free of rabies as defined in the OIE Code. As already stated at first reading, this is not in line with the risk analysis approach that we need to adopt, so these amendments cannot be accepted. In fact, this would not be consistent with the conditions applicable to movements inside the Union, as some Member States are not 'rabies free' under the OIE Code definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory, as Ms Evans mentioned. We therefore need to take a similar approach to third countries with similar circumstances. Finally, on the technical amendments, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all Member States consider microchipping to be a reliable method of identification, and I look favourably on automatic harmonisation after a transitional period of eight years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the seven institutional amendments. In a spirit of compromise, the Commission could consider favourably Amendment No 5, which aims to introduce a codecision procedure for the extension of specific provisions applicable to the UK, Ireland and Sweden. The Commission could also have accepted Amendment No 16 as an alternative to Amendment No 12, and I regret therefore that Amendment No 16 has been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 unreasonably deprives the Commission of any possibility to propose temporary measures, whereas Amendment No 16 would have allowed this in a reasonable way. I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 12.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I accept the other four amendments. Amendments Nos 10 and 11 would limit the executive competence of the Commission to 'technical' aspects. This wording would very likely give rise to legal arguments on the interpretation of the word 'technical', which is not defined in the legislation. This would jeopardise the sound management and efficient implementation of the regulation. Amendments Nos 14 and 15 cannot be accepted because they go beyond the institutional agreement. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that they are not consistent with the dual legal base of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have adequately explained the reasoning behind the positions I have taken on the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of this, I believe that it is vital for moves and travel across borders within the EU to be made easier for families and individuals who are travelling with a pet.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council’s proposal has taken into account the views put forward in Parliament’s first consideration of the matter. I find it incomprehensible that there are currently different provisions relating to animal health when transporting pets for commercial purposes in the EU. The risk of rabies infection cannot be significantly different simply because the purpose of the pet’s journey is different. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the health rules for transporting pets for commercial purposes to this directive.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this measure is of great significance in those countries – the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden – which are now bringing their rules on the movement of pet animals into line with practices elsewhere in the Community. Like the rapporteur, I believe it is a pity that we could not reach agreement before the conciliation stage, but I understand the differences. Some of those differences will be reflected in this debate, and I still have some minor differences with the rapporteur, which she has already acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">For those countries which have prevented the entry of animals that may be at risk of rabies without a long period of quarantine, this is, in a way, an act of faith. It is made possible by the fact that we now have effective vaccination methods which can be indicated by the transponder chip. We have recently had representations from some members of the veterinary profession arguing for an extension of the tattooing principle and claiming that the transponder chip can be surgically removed or otherwise nullified. I cannot accept those arguments. There is broad agreement between the Commission and all Members of this House that we should move toward alignment.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur's concern that the movement of young animals, which must present at least some element of risk, should be subject to the same constraints as that of other categories. I have not been able to follow the arguments against that, other than that it may, somewhere along the line, affect the trade in animals. But, as the Commissioner well knows, trade in animals, if it is not effectively handled, has led to the perpetuation of some serious abuses in the Community in recent years. I do not believe this is a persuasive argument.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, however, with the Commission and not the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 7, 8, and 9. It is counterproductive to introduce amendments which will effectively constrain the movement of animals between some existing Member States, as well as extending the scheme – as the United Kingdom and other countries with the current constraints would like – to countries that are not rabies-free. For the United States and Canada, for example, we see no reason why there should be the further impediments set out in Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteur, however, on the question of comitology. I welcome the Commissioner's assurance that a suitable amendment allowing for reference to Parliament at any process of review will be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, although this is a small measure to many and will not mean much to those countries where animals routinely cross internal EU borders, for those who cherish pets as lifelong companions it is a measure that will be greatly welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Doctor Mouthon, however, a professor at the Maison-Alfort vet school in France, cast considerable doubt upon the reliability of the method. On 21 March 2002, he demonstrated, before a witness, how easy it was to deactivate the microchips so as to render them unreadable using a simple electric device producing magnetic radiation. He did this without leaving any marks and without causing any pain. I have provided you with the witness report. He also states that the microchip can move around the animal’s body, as shown in x-rays, medical reports and surgical studies; that the microchip can be removed using nothing more than a Stanley knife, as has come to light, when trafficking rings in pet animals have been broken up.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this rather unreliable procedure will triple the cost of identification. It costs approximately EUR 22 for a traditional tattoo, almost EUR 70 for a microchip, involving a mandatory visit to the vet, who from now on has the monopoly on identification. This excessive cost will penalise millions of dog and cat owners – particularly the least well-off, for whom a pet animal is a source of comfort – whereas in France, as the rapporteur points out, we have a cheap and reliable centralised register, which has been working well for some time now and which makes it easy to firmly identify and, therefore, to find stray animals. This is, in my view, the objective we are seeking. So why try to harmonise everything, especially if it is to align the system against the least reliable method? Let us, on an issue of such little strategic importance, allow subsidiarity to have a completely free reign and allow the two systems to work side by side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
