<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jöns (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to tell you that 15 national presidents from the European Breast Cancer Coalition, Europa Donna, are following this debate in the public gallery.</p>
<p class="contents">Breast cancer affects all of us. In the European Union, someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes. Every year, 216 000 women suffer from this disease and 79 000 women still die from it even though 90% of all cases can be cured if they are diagnosed and properly treated at an early stage. For the most part, these women die when they have their most important responsibilities in society. Breast cancer is still the most frequent cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55. Every year, though, 25 000 women could be saved if all Member States were to offer proper preventive care, that is to say, screening in accordance with the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening. They would provide women with a guarantee that their radiologist carries out only breast X-ray examinations and that he reads about 5 000 mammograph screenings a year, which enables him to evaluate them with an experienced eye.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely unacceptable that, eleven years after the EU guidelines were submitted, only eight Member States offer national mammography screening programmes. In countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 90% of all women aged between 50 and 69 already participate in screening programmes, but in my own country of Germany, barely 2% of women in this age group are offered screening. This despite the fact that, according to the World Health Organisation, it can be proved that mammography screening reduces mortality by an unbelievable 35%.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the best early detection is of no use however if subsequent treatment is inadequate, or downright wrong. The report therefore calls on Member States to establish a network of multidisciplinary breast centres to cover the entire population of the EU, with one centre for every 330 000 inhabitants. These centres should be certified by an independent body and subject to regular review. The entire medical team of doctors and nurses should specialise in both benign and malignant breast disease and there should be multidisciplinary case conferences to discuss each case. It is particularly important that the surgeons should perform only breast operations, and that the centre should perform a minimum of 150 primary breast cancer operations per year, because expert knowledge comes only through experience.</p>
<p class="contents">These breast centres are extremely important because it has been shown that women who are treated in them have a higher chance of being cured. Rates of survival in Sweden, for example, which has both nation-wide screening and breast centres, are 16% higher than in Austria, where neither of these exist. In fact, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have breast centres that cover the entire country. It is precisely because of these disparities in the mortality and survival rates that we must develop a common European strategy in the fight against breast cancer. We have to get the right information quicker and get better at exchanging experience. We have to introduce a system of benchmarking and be guided by best practice. This is the only way to save the lives of more women and, at the same time, help to reduce the cost of health care. And I am convinced that it is the only way to exert positive pressure on countries that lag behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is also true of national cancer registers, which are a fundamental prerequisite for reliable data, and which exist only in half of the Member States. Our request to governments to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU is not unrealistic. It can be achieved if the political will exists and if the medical profession supports us. The United Kingdom has been exemplary in showing us how. In this regard, I would ask the Commission to join us in taking stock of the situation in 2006. We know that the Commission is on our side. This was made clear once more with the proposal for a Council recommendation on cancer prevention. It is only if the proposals made in this report are rapidly implemented that every woman in Europe – irrespective of place of residence, social status and education – will soon have the same optimum screening for, and treatment of, cancer.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, this is not the first time Mrs Jöns has brought as serious a matter as combating breast cancer into the limelight in a very specific and efficient manner and it is important and proves yet again that the commitment and systematic work of one person can set policies in motion. Thus, I should like personally to congratulate Mrs Jöns both on the quality of her report and on her continuous commitment to this very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against breast cancer is a public health priority. A number of figures were quoted. I think it is important to repeat them so that we understand the size of the problem. 220,000 new cases a year, 75,000 women who die from this disease. However, according to estimates and studies, the lives of 25,000 women a year could have been saved if proper screening practices were applied to all women in the European Union. Prevention, therefore, proper screening, saves lives and that is also the report's message.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs Jöns examines both best practices in connection with cancer screening and best practices and effective experience in connection with treatment for and care of breast cancer. It is important to say that many of the elements and proposals formulated emanate from the various actions undertaken by the Commission between the years 1987 and 2002 within the framework of three successive ‘Europe Against Cancer’ programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">These programmes, together with the new programme in the field of public health illustrate the Commission's commitment to combating this major illness. One important element of policies at European level, therefore, is the inventory we have today and the knowledge we have about what is happening in the Member States, so that we can choose the best and most efficient practices and so that the Member States themselves can identify their own weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important element of policies and choices is the proposal for a recommendation, which essentially also illustrates the Commission's commitment. The proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening issued on 5 May. The objective of this proposal is to formulate recommendations for the implementation of mass screening programmes on a proper scientific basis. This recommendation has already been submitted to the Council of Ministers for Health, which was held on Monday this week. What does it contain? Essentially it contains a proposal for measures which aim to correlate screening practices with the results obtained in the various Member States. This means that there must now be quantitative targets from the Member States concerning the rate of reduction in the death rate from cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal for a recommendation is a general framework which, of course, cannot have the binding force of legislation, given that we all know that these are issues that come under the jurisdiction of the Member States. However, this proposal for a recommendation makes provision for the submission of a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes on the basis of the statistics provided by the Member States by the end of the third year after the date of their approval, and this report will constitute the basis for evaluating and analysing any further action.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the proposal for a recommendation which, as I said, was the second basic element of the European Union's policy after the inventory of the existing situation, the third important element is the action programmes. The Commission has undertaken a major action which relates to the public health programme for the years 2000-2008. These programmes make use of the results and achievements of previous programmes, including the programme against cancer, and the relevant networks. And here I should like to welcome to the gallery the representatives of the networks, the chairmen of the organisations fighting breast cancer, and say that, in our experience also, it is clear that the role of these organisations, the commitment of volunteers, the commitment of civil society, plays a very important role and we see that, in numerous countries, there have been essential improvements and changes to the situation in the field of breast cancer due to the operation of these networks. Of course, some of them are also pan-European in range.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the Commission is due to submit a final report to the European Parliament and the Council on the success of this ‘Europe Against Cancer’ programme. This programme, the public health programme, includes exchanges of information and best practices between the Member States. Essentially, it is about reinforcing cooperation between states so that each can learn from the other. This is in keeping with paragraph 13 of Mrs Jöns' report and, of course, it recognises and supports the need for common strategies and actions in sectors such as research and technical equipment and technological development, which is also in keeping with paragraph 6 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently evaluating the numerous proposals for plans submitted for funding in 2003. In conjunction with the priorities of the programme of work for 2003, the services will take account in the final choice of the priorities set out in the report and, of course, we shall take serious account of all the recommendations formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for a conference on the outcome of the ‘Europe Against Cancer’ programme is concerned, I think that it should be discussed with the next presidencies. I should like to express a slight hesitation as to the possibility of its being organised within the framework of the Italian Presidency, given that there is not much time, but of course we can try and find the best possible time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to inform you that the Commission intends to create a health information portal on the Internet. This portal will be a source of information on public health in the European Union; its content will cover a wealth of topics and it will be a single point of access for citizens, patients, doctors, experts, the competent authorities and the networks. We believe that this portal will be an important tool in everyone's hands for exchanging experiences and promoting policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to close by thanking Mrs Jöns on behalf of Mr Byrne, who was prevented from coming by very important commitments, for her particular contribution to the implementation of our common objective and to congratulate her warmly.</p>

That the European Union is not only active in the field of cancer prevention and the detection of this terrible disease, but also creates the opportunities to cure cancer through the research programme there are EUR 400 million available for this research programme must be heartening for the European citizen. That is also the reason why Mrs Jöns and I, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and together with all its members, have worked together consummately to ensure that the report of our rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, now before you can really be seamlessly supported by our group. Together we have followed a path that we think is the best for everyone who has to face, will have to face or has had to face the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There are great differences in Europe. I am proud of my own country: our screening programme is perfect, but that does not mean that there is nothing now to be done there. There are differences in the sense that the breast cancer problem is greater for women in the Northern European countries, at least it occurs more, and that in other countries – and I am looking at the accession countries here too – it occurs less but the chance of a cure also differs very widely across the European Union. That means that what was started in the 1990s with the breast screening programmes now requires further completion, and that is why we stand together. I shall be making a further remark about this directly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the Commission for attention to be given to other programmes, other forms of cancer that are also very curable and to which I feel we have really devoted too little attention to date. One example is cervical cancer, which you can detect very early using the HPV test and for which we as the European Union should be exerting rather more pressure on the Member States to be rather more active in this regard too, because if it is detected then in most cases it can be cured. The same goes for prostate cancer. Same problem. Let there be rather more attention given to them too in the new programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done is look to see whether the Commission’s guidelines and programmes are adequate, where, in order to arrive at solutions, we can really only advise the Member States. A number of points have, I think, been highlighted. First of all I would mention screening, apart from which, however, it is also of the utmost importance that women, when the existence of breast cancer is suspected, should be taken care of very quickly. I have to say that in my country we make the occasional gaffe in this regard. Prompt detection therefore, but prompt treatment also. That is of the utmost importance and I ask you too, Commissioner, to devote attention to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another situation we must avoid is one in which, whenever cancer is detected, any small hospital can then take action. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary tackling of the problem leads to the best chances of cure and I think that every woman in the European Union has a right to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we have waited a long time for this debate, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for all her work on this issue. It often takes one person to drive an issue forward and to obtain a result and if it were not for Mrs Jöns and all her hard work, we would probably not be sitting here today debating this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Breast cancer is one of the greatest health problems facing Scotland and the EU as a whole. It is the most common form of cancer amongst women in Scotland and the second leading cause of death in all women. The disease affects one in nine women and claims 13 000 lives in the UK every year. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55. These are quite chilling statistics, so what can we do to help prevent breast cancer in the first place? And if diagnosed, how can we ensure that women get the best possible treatment?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as the rapporteur recognises, screening has to be a priority. Although treatment in Scotland and the UK is better than in most Member States, with specialist nurses and the promotion of breast care centres, it is still the case that, unlike with smear testing, women only start being screened automatically at the age of 50. The Scottish breast-screening programme currently invites eligible women aged 50-64 every three years. This is a good start, but we know there is always more that can be done. I would like to see more women screened at an early age across the EU and in the applicant states, and although women who have a history of breast cancer in their family are more aware of the risks, and start screening earlier, there is more we can do to push Member States to promote earlier and better diagnosis.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent studies show that, with improved screening of young and middle-aged women, mortality rates could be reduced by about one quarter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on prevention: interestingly the report mentions that the increase in breast cancer has been worldwide since the end of the Second World War. Part of the reason is better diagnosis and also people understanding about genetics and family history, but our environment, lifestyle, habits and general quality of life may be related. That is why research is so important, as are other directives promoted by the EU: for example, the new chemicals directive which is about to work its way through the parliamentary process and may be another way to try and minimise the risks that we as EU citizens face in our daily lives; the same applies to our work in dioxins and the eHealth communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to make sure that organisations like Europa Donna which have done so much work across Europe on the issue of breast cancer awareness are given the support they deserve. Women in the EU diagnosed with breast cancer need to understand the treatment options available to them. It is important that patients have access to useful information about breast cancer and support systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the importance of information and awareness runs through this report; this is our goal and we should all be aiming for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group spoke very appreciatively of it, despite the fact that a number of Members feel that some parts go too far in the direction of subsidiarity and for this reason abstained from the vote in committee. All the members of my group regard the report, as such, as being of high quality. I think that that is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have appreciation for the Commissioner and her vision of how things should proceed with this report. She has said that it is important to gather and to record knowledge. This view I share entirely. Member States will themselves certainly become better acquainted with their own weaknesses if they look across the border at others. That is by no means a luxury. If we look at the report closely, we see that there is a 60% greater chance of developing breast cancer in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe. We really must learn from that. Why is this so? If we look at the growth in the number of women with breast cancer, again there are significant differences. In the European Union, for example, the number of women with breast cancer is showing the greatest growth in my own country. There must be reasons for this that we can find.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we read for example that women from urban areas are more prone to breast cancer than women from rural areas. A lot of research is therefore needed to see what factors really do have an impact on breast cancer. Is it actually true that the effect of using oestrogens is to increase the risk of breast cancer rather than to reduce it? The answers to many of these questions remain unsatisfactory and I think that it is excellent that where we can all learn from research we do it collectively at a European level. This is after all the most useful way of spending the money.</p>
<p class="contents">I also greatly appreciate the volunteers and the voluntary organisations that have done much to improve the quality of the treatment. Personally I am a great advocate of treatment in breast centres. Not only because of the greater chance of survival there, but also because of the total approach to the problem that women face. For women it is after all in some cases a violation of their body. A violation of the way in which they feel they lead their life as a woman. For a long time little attention was paid to this and we looked too much at the technical side of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think it extremely important that we should continue with what the Commissioner has proposed. I also appreciate that she will be bringing forward a plan to provide information about cancer in general on the Internet. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has also made a number of important points. I therefore hope that we shall soon see all this in place and that the conference that has been requested will also be organised quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are frightening statistics and I think that the drama of discovering breast cancer in a woman is still a major trauma for herself and her family, even though this cancer can often be cured if discovered early on. One in eight, though, is too high a risk and in Belgium we are in fourth place behind the Netherlands, Denmark and France. We must also take into account that there are unacceptably large differences in the chances of survival, depending on whether you live in one country or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Early detection, diagnosis and treatment and aftercare help thousands of women to survive, but these chances of survival vary from 81% in France to 58% in Poland and Slovakia. That must make us think. The quality of the research must therefore be reliable and in this regard it concerns me that only eight countries are considering doing a general screening test. There are discussions about this. In Belgium they are baulking at the idea, on the one hand, because of the cost, but on the other I am sure that there is great pressure from the medical world to keep it to individual medical investigations by your own doctor. It would be good to examine the results of these different approaches critically in the light of what you, Commissioner, called cooperation in connection with knowledge gathering.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a common European strategy, but there is a need to do more than prevention alone. I think that we need to do more research into the causes. Various fellow Members, Mrs Boogerd among them, have pointed out that there are still many unresearched areas. In particular I should like to bring Mrs Jöns’s recommendation in paragraph 11 to your attention and ask you to discuss it with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, because the consequence of the patenting of genes could be that this monopoly unnecessarily stands in the way of breast cancer research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully endorse all the calls to the Member States to achieve a rate of voluntary participation in breast screening programmes by women of over 70%, a level which no country has yet reached. I consider to be important the call to promote and disseminate in the Member States technical and care training initiatives and initiatives to provide patients suffering from breast cancer with psychological support, and to promote at Community level training and specialisation courses which – and this is my addition – are underwritten by university institutions, second level Masters degrees. These courses could even be financed out of the training funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I can support the call to create European registers on tumours as soon as possible so that reliable, comparable data is, at last, available throughout the European Union on tumour growth in general. It is right to call upon the Member States to use resources from the Structural Funds to fund the creation of infrastructure in the health sector. I fully endorse the rapporteur’s call for health insurance for, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, aesthetic aids such as bra prostheses, wigs and whatever else a patient needs to restore their appearance as closely as possible to how is was before the illness. In many states, reimbursement is not provided for these aids.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of points which give cause for concern. I would like to point out first of all that a point is missing from the report produced by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities which is essential if that committee is to be able to claim the title ‘Equal Opportunities’. The rapporteur has made no reference to cancer in men. I regret to say that this type of cancer affects men too: basically, one man per 100 000 people between the ages of 58 and 63 develops breast cancer. I would add that the prognosis for men is more unfavourable than for women precisely because men are not subject to screening and the cancer is diagnosed late.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether it would not be appropriate for the committee to grant men at least the same right to information as is accorded to women. Male cancer accounts for 1% of all breast tumours and I realise that its incidence is not economically significant enough to think about providing specific screening. I do, however, believe that an awareness campaign directed at the male population would be appropriate so that men can have the same chance as women of having their lives prolonged and their quality of life increased by early diagnosis. Young men are the most likely to develop breast cancer because of the wide use of female hormones and metabolisers, which spark off gynaecomastia which often goes untreated.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7(g) of the report in question. I feel that informing patients that they can exercise the right to lodge complaints against doctors for malpractice is unnecessary, in that this right is already laid down in the European Charter of Patients’ Rights, and that it is dangerous, for it could jeopardise the relationship of trust between doctors and patients on which studies and research have shown that half the success of treatment depends. I feel it would make more sense for these kinds of controls on the appropriateness of the quality of treatment to be carried out by dedicated institutions such as, for example, the European board for monitoring centres of excellence – specialist breast units. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women between the ages of 35 and 55. Cancer rates differ substantially from one country to another in the European Union: they are higher in the northern European countries and lower in the southern countries, such as Greece and Spain. Lithuania and Latvia also have low rates. In all countries, the rate is rising every year. Economic, environmental and even cultural factors have a large impact on these figures and breast cancer primarily affects women in higher social classes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer, which is the most effective means of achieving good results and a high chance of survival, are only recommendations and are not binding from a legal point of view. States draw up their own prevention and treatment plans, and these differ significantly from one State to another. In some countries, the programmes are regional, and there are still some Member States where early detection programmes do not even reach all women within the high-risk age bracket.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which is timely and very well written, aims to raise awareness throughout the European Union of this problem, which mainly affects women. Its publication has been a wise move on the part of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Every woman should have access to high-quality screening for, treatment of and aftercare in the event of breast cancer. As a result, we must do away with the disparities that currently exist among the Member States, whose survival rates vary by up to 16%.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective means, at this stage, of treating the cancer is still early diagnosis. The Community programme ‘Europe Against Cancer’ has been very effective and an excellent example, and we should therefore follow the same path in the future. Early detection, with programmes to ensure regular screening of women aged over 50, must be established in all of the Member States and the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The collaboration and increased awareness of women are of enormous importance: self-examination is an extremely useful tool, although mammography screening is the most effective technique for the early detection of the cancer. The fight against breast cancer must be a health policy priority and the Member States must draw up effective health policies and strategies to ensure better early detection, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is very comprehensive, detailed and precise, and I congratulate Mrs Jöns on her willingness to accept suggestions and amendments that have improved the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and would like to thank the House for the support given to Mrs Jöns’s report. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities calls in the report for the fight against breast cancer to become a health policy priority for the EU. High-quality screening, diagnosis, treatment and aftercare for breast cancer must form an integrated whole and be provided in Member States. With the Commission’s support, this can be done by 2008 in accordance with our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, a woman dies of breast cancer every 20 minutes. In Germany, every year 46 000 women suffer from this disease and 19 000 die from it. Breast cancer affects women at the height of their professional and family responsibilities. In women between the ages of 35 and 55, breast cancer is still the most common cause of death. On behalf of my group, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns. Her work has a very positive influence, not only because of her own victory over breast cancer, but also because she is fighting for all women in the European Union to receive the best possible treatment. Our aims are high-quality national screening and the establishment of breast centres. The relevant guidelines have already been developed by the European Society for Mastology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Europa Donna. Now it is a question of transposing them quickly. The multidisciplinary breast centres shall bring together radiologists, oncologists, pathologists, psychologists and surgeons, who will consult with the patient on the best method of treatment for her. In Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands a nation-wide screening programme has led to a 30% reduction in the mortality rate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now been allocated EUR 400 million in the sixth framework programme of research. At the earliest possible opportunity, national cancer registers should be set up so that we may finally have informative data about the possible influence of risk factors like tobacco, diet, life-style and environment on the development of cancer. This is particularly important with regard to breast cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">We do of course clash with other interest groups. In my native state of Bavaria, for example, we are taking a different path because X-raying is going to be left to general practitioners. It is only in accordance with the EU guidelines, however, that optimal treatment can be attained. Only when the attending physician reads at least 5 000 mammograph screenings per year does he acquire enough training and experience to recognise breast cancer when it is between five and seven millimetres. Those who do not support this are concerned only with the interests of their professional groups and not with our goal of saving thousands of women’s lives. Every seventh or eighth woman will be affected. We can count through each row here and see how many of us that will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it affects us, it affects our spouses, families and children. Moreover, the psychological climate surrounding this disease is not without impact on the lives of those around us.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, as the rapporteur stresses, it is difficult to compare the available data in the absence of uniform standards, they do show that breast cancer incidence fluctuates from one country of the European Union to another. As already mentioned, then, the disease is one of the main causes of death for women between the ages of 35 and 55, which is why it is essential to define early detection and overall care of patients as European priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what Mrs Jöns’ report makes clear to us. It recommends the implementation of detection campaigns carried out in multidisciplinary clinics (this is very, very important), providing medical care if necessary, of course, but also psychological and social care, delivered before and after treatment by highly-trained staff. This can sometimes be another great asset in treating the illness.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, a cancer steering committee published a report in January 2003, which has very recently allowed the President of the Republic to draw up a national plan for an anti-cancer campaign. The French report bears remarkable similarities to your own, in terms both of its findings and the objectives it proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the physical and psychological stress caused by breast cancer treatments, and in order to ensure the best possible quality of life for women, it is essential to act pre-emptively, through suitable information and prevention policies, to encourage women of all ages to undergo regular screening.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we can only agree that there is a need to coordinate national policies, pursue the development of European mammography guidelines, intensify research, review the problem of gene patenting by the European Patents Office and establish registers other than the national ones currently in existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jöns’ report, as adopted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, seems to respond to these objectives. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has decided to vote for the motion, for I have to say that it shows a certain amount of courage. Furthermore, since we are lucky enough to have a woman Commissioner here today, and since we know that the fifth framework programme has set aside EUR 400 million, why not make cancer a major priority in Europe from 2004, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">That would be a proactive response to Mrs Jöns’ call for a conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We realised at the public hearing, with sadness, disappointment and surprise, that very little money is available for research into diseases which afflict women particularly frequently, such as osteoporosis, the consequences of the menopause and breast cancer, the subject of today's debate. In other words, we found that more funds are available for diseases which mainly afflict men, and I say this for the benefit of my male colleagues, rather than for the benefit of the diseases which hit women; in other words, when it comes to combating diseases and health problems, there is also gender discrimination. And I should also like to ask the European Commission to look as this, because, as the data which the Commissioner and other honourable Members referred to show, one in eight women is afflicted by this serious disease, which mainly afflicts women between the ages of 35 and 55.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, are asking and calling for more research into the causes, for early diagnosis, for preventive measures and for treatment, once the disease has manifested itself. Of course, we recognise the efforts being made by the European Commission and I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for all the positive messages you have given us today about the promotion of measures and programmes with specific targets and, most importantly, for the fact that there will be an evaluation of the results and you will take account of the proposals formulated in Mrs Jöns' report in the recommendation which you are planning for the Member States and, finally, for the fact that you will take advantage of the opportunities afforded us by new technologies, especially the Internet.

<p class="contents">The number of breast cancer cases has increased at a terrifying rate in the European Union. By way of example, I wish to draw attention to the fact that in Portugal, breast cancer is the main cause of death amongst women over 45 years of age. 3 500 new cases are diagnosed every year in my country, and every day five women die from this disease. Both a real political will and practical measures to improve this situation do exist, however. I therefore thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on her excellent report, which alerts us to the many worrying aspects of this specific type of cancer, both in Europe and throughout the world and urges us all to act urgently and make the fight against cancer one of the fundamental priorities of health policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge we face is drastically to reduce breast cancer mortality rates in Europe, but also to eliminate disparities between Member States where the quality of health care is concerned and, consequently, women’s chances of survival. We must therefore act at different levels:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, prevention and screening. Awareness-raising campaigns must be promoted, to show that early diagnosis of the disease increases the probability that it can be cured. Member States must offer screenings at two-year intervals for women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, as recommended, in fact, in the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly: diagnosis. All Member States must ensure that women are informed of the results of a mammography within five working days and wait no more than four weeks following diagnosis before treatment begins;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly: treatment and follow-up. Women suffering from breast cancer must be treated by multidisciplinary teams that have received and continue to receive appropriate professional training. To help patients to get through the treatment phase as painlessly as possible, they must be given access to psychological support, physiotherapy and social services. After treatment, the stage of medical and emotional aftercare is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to end on a hopeful note and say that we will one day be able to defeat and eradicate this disease. Let us therefore make the best use not only of the EUR 400 million provided for cancer research by the sixth framework programme of research, but also of the new action programme in the field of public health (2003-2008), to develop innovative initiatives and projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the statistics just quoted – one women in ten is or will suffer from this disease – show that it is the most frequent cause of death for women aged between 35 and 55, and that we might have been able to prevent the deaths of 75 000 women per year if we had set up a much earlier prevention programme. Therefore, this scourge cannot but become one of our most important targets over the next few years. I am keen, then, to thank Mrs Jöns for her report and, above all, for the perseverance she has shown as well as the quality of the work she has produced.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential, then, to promote and encourage preventive screening methods, to inform women and aim prevention campaigns at them. However, my practical experience in this sector suggests to me that there are other obstacles, sometimes socioeconomic and often cultural. We know that early diagnosis is still the best method of improving prognosis and treatment, and that early detection will make breast cancer easier to cure and less traumatic for the patient. Subsequently, it is important to help women suffering from the disease. That being the case, networks of multidisciplinary treatment centres offering women medical care and psychological and social advice are utterly fundamental to the plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would point out that today’s debate cannot be closed. The fight against breast cancer must be part of a large-scale programme and continue to be a subject of research. That is why I feel that it should indeed be linked with the Sixth Framework Programme for research and the EUR 400 million dedicated to cancer research. It seems to me that the report on breast implants, approved in February of this year, is a positive and high-quality contribution to this aspect of women’s health. Furthermore, the proposed Commission recommendation to the Member States for better cancer detection will provide an opportunity to continue the debate on this subject, which is so important for women, and, I would add, for society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Karin Jöns.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives key importance to quality standards and best practice, which Community health policy can help evaluate and which can be extended throughout all the Member States. At present there are enormous disparities in the quality of treatment for breast cancer patients between Member States and regions. Regrettably, this is directly reflected in the chances of survival of women with breast cancer, which is directly affected by the disparity in access to screening, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">According to recent statistics from the World Health Organisation, approximately 80 000 women die from breast cancer in the Union every year. It is the most frequent cancer in women and the most frequent cause of death in middle-aged women in the EU. We could predict that the rise in the standard of living for women in the new Member States and the candidate countries and changes in lifestyle there will make the figures look even worse. There is an urgent need to create a network of national cancer registers to cover the entire enlarged Europe so as to obtain conclusive and comparable data as a basis for research. At present such a register only exists in seven Member States of the Union, in addition to my own country, and so not even half the citizens of the Union are covered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the Commission will target Community resources in particular at more effective research into the causes of breast cancer and forms of treatment as well as methods for assessing the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the socio-economic and lifestyle factors the genotype is an important risk factor in breast cancer. To date, two defective genes have been identified as causing breast cancer. The European Patent Office is at present deliberating over an application to patent these breast cancer genes. Granting such a patent would be very harmful as far as research and improvements in treatment are concerned. The decision by the European Patent Office will be tremendously important. It is in the interests of all the European actors, and their duty too, to ensure that the human genetic code is not patented but is freely available for research and the development of medical treatments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for the kind way in which you received the group of Finnish schoolchildren in April and took the trouble to come and meet them personally in Parliament. Your friendly and very warm attitude overwhelmed us all and gave these young people the inspiration and encouragement to face their problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swiebel (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Jöns has written an excellent report. The point has frequently been made in this debate that breast cancer is the most common cause of death in the European Union in women between 35 and 55. For this reason alone it is a subject deserving all our attention. It might also be worth mentioning, though, that the age group above this one is badly affected as well. One of the key points is that in the Member States there are currently still too many differences in the diagnosis, the quality of the treatment and the care of breast cancer and therefore in the chances of survival. But should it make any difference which country or which area or which hospital you are treated in? The same is true of diseases affecting men and I refer here in particular to prostate cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time for the European Union to adopt a more active approach in the combating of breast cancer in all countries, including the candidate Member States, in order to lift care to a higher level. The recommendations in the present report give all the relevant starting points. I am also very pleased with what the Commissioner has said, which demonstrates her positive commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already universal screening programmes in operation in a number of Member States. In the Netherlands there is one such programme for women between 50 and 75. I recently took part in it myself and I have to say that I find it very reassuring to know that early detection increases the chance of cure. Another positive element in the combating of breast cancer is that treatment by multidisciplinary teams leads to substantially better results and it seems to me that more attention here to the psychosocial side of the matter is by no means an excessive luxury. Breast cancer in women is not just a technico-medical matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the recording of comparable European data concerning the development of breast cancer is needed. Such data may be an extra stimulus for more European research, especially into the causes of breast cancer. Let us be honest: we still know little about the causal factors. In short, a splendid and very specific report deserving of implementation and the sort of report that merits further discussion in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Considering that breast cancer can be cured in 90% of cases if diagnosed early on and properly treated, as is shown, not least, by the figures provided by Mrs Jöns and by current research; considering that high quality breast screening within the framework of a regional or national programme can reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by as much as 35% for women between the ages of 50 and 69, and that, according to scientific studies recorded, the mortality rate can be reduced by 20% for women between 40 and 49 too, every woman should have access to screening, to treatment and to high quality aftercare, irrespective of where they live, their social position, profession or level of education.</p>
<p class="contents">The main important points of Mrs Jöns’ report are precisely an excellent prevention strategy, rapid treatment and appropriate post-operative care. Thus, the call to the Member States and the Commission – I would like to thank the Commissioner for her words this morning, which were reassuring – to make combating breast cancer a priority in health policy and to develop and implement effective strategies for increasing prevention, with the goal of reducing the average breast cancer mortality rate in the Union by 25% by 2008, is a key point of this report, as is the right for women suffering from breast cancer to be treated by a multidisciplinary team. It is therefore important for the Member States to develop a wide network of certified multidisciplinary breast units which meet specific quality criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point which I want to stress is the importance of research. The Sixth Framework Programme allocates funds to research: that is all well and good, but we need to insist that these funds for research increase, thanks, not least, to increased commitment from the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Breast cancer, Mr President, is the most common cancer in the European Union. The report by Mrs Jöns highlights some very important information and several approaches the Member States would do well to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Public Health Programme 2000-2008 and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research are very appropriate arenas for proceeding with this task of reducing the effects of breast cancer. Research and gene therapy will also help us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also congratulate and thank the national and international cancer networks for their work, without which it would probably be impossible to make any headway. However, we must agree on certain things, such as the age at which early detection programmes should begin. Perhaps we are starting quite late in the day and we need to harmonise this therapy. It is also important to harmonise the collection of data and to align the situation on the ground and the treatments used. The disparities as regards the effect of breast cancer among the countries of the European Union and between these countries and the candidate countries are enormous. It is vital that we work together to harmonise this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably the most important aspects are health education, prevention, early detection, self-examination and, of course, mammography screening. Rapid treatment is essential; there are many women who have few resources at hand in this respect, to teach them how to examine themselves and at what stage in their lives they need to seek treatment. I therefore believe that it is vital for Mrs Jöns’ work to follow this same path, because each and every one of us will benefit from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
