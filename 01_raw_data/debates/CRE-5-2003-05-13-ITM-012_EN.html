<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by extending the Commission’s thanks to the rapporteurs of both the leading Committees for the outstanding work they have done, both on the regulation on European Cooperative Societies and on the related directive on the involvement of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, in the European Union, at least 130 000 cooperative societies, which have 2.3 million employees and well in excess of 80 million members. The regulations will put in the hands of these cooperative societies an instrument for cross-border transactions right across the internal market similar to that already enacted for public limited companies in the form of the Statute for a European Limited Company.</p>
<p class="contents">Associations of cooperative societies in Europe have been demanding this sort of statute for some years now, and the text of the regulation now before you has met with their approval. The Statute will also make it possible to form cross-border syndicates on the basis of cooperative society structures, enabling enterprises of this type to build up joint activities, become more competitive, and enter more diverse markets. Parliament expressed its approval for the Statute for a European Cooperative Society at first reading, which was on 20 January 1993. This initial position taken by Parliament resulted in numerous improvements to the text of the Commission proposal as later amended, which Parliament approved on 2 December 1993, reconfirming that approval on 27 October 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the regulation is not perfect, it reflects a broad consensus on what rules should apply to this new form of cooperative enterprise. At Council level, it met with the Member States’ unanimous approval, something that constitutes considerable progress in view of the individual Member States’ divergent regulations on cooperative societies. From the outset, the Commission has had the objective of creating an instrument that would be, on the one hand, flexible and modern, whilst, on the other, taking into account the particular characteristics of cooperative societies and the principles underlying them. We are glad that this balance is maintained in the Regulation in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 79 offers the possibility of removing any inadequacies brought to light by the experience of the first five years of implementation, and so the Commission will monitor the application of the Statute with a view to the possible revision of the Regulation. The Members of this Parliament regard as extremely dubious the Council’s unilateral and unanimous decision to change the legal basis in such a way as to deprive Parliament of its right of codecision, and it is understandable that they should do so. The Commission took Article 95 as the legal basis for its proposal on the grounds that this article has the completion of the internal market as its objective. We continue to believe that Article 95 provides the right legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With almost no exceptions, the amendments proposed for a second time have to do with the protection of the employees’ interests. The Commission takes the view that the directive must fully protect their rights, and that it must be complied with when a European Cooperative Society is set up. The directive is the right place for this rule, and so we cannot support the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the directive on the involvement of employees, which complements the Regulation and represents a very comprehensive piece of legislation intended to guarantee in an appropriate way employees’ rights to information, consultation and co-determination. In its essentials, the text is based on the corresponding directive on the European Limited Company, adopted one and a half years ago, and the Commission believes that it merits your support. Parliament now wishes to make a number of amendments to it, many of which are undoubted improvements. Having examined in detail all the amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission is prepared to agree, either fully or in part, to half of them and to support these in the Council. Amendments Nos 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 and 22 can be accepted as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also in agreement with a number of other amendments, which, however, still require certain minor changes of formulation in order to take into account the concerns of certain Member States. The amendments in question are Nos 4, 14, 17, 20 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving to one side the debate on the legal basis, we believe that the Council, too, is open to most of these amendments. We hope that this means that both the Regulation and the directive can be adopted by the Council in June, so that there will be a legal framework conducive to those European Cooperative Societies that want to extend their activities across frontiers, with, at the same time, their employees being guaranteed appropriate protection of their interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do indeed have before us a very important report, a very important piece of legislation for the very large number of people in the European Union who have joined together in common enterprises in order to pool their strengths and bring those strengths to market more effectively. In a European Union in which more and more work is done across borders, this sort of collaborative effort across borders is quite clearly very much needed and very deserving of support.</p>
<p class="contents">It was as long ago as 13 April 1983 that Parliament first adopted a resolution on European Cooperative Societies, which fact shows what great importance Parliament has always attached to legislation in this area. The Commission also took on board our concerns, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, we did indeed, after some time, have the beginnings of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very regrettable that the Council – after Parliament, in 1993, had given its position, and a very good position at that – took all of eleven years to adopt a resolution on the subject, and had ulterior motives, some of them quite unrelated to the matter in hand, for not taking action in this area. The fact is that we find that unacceptable, and so, above all, do the people that this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say in relation to this that I cannot commend the Council for the way in which it simply changed the legal basis, and, when forwarding the new text to Parliament, did not even think it necessary to explain why this change had been made and on what arguments it was actually founded. At any rate, there is nothing on the subject in the official documents we have been given. I do not think this is any way for Parliament and the Council to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, naturally enough, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market gave particular attention to the legal basis, for what is at stake here is a weighty matter, namely the rights of Parliament, and it would be a strange parliament that simply said ‘yes’ and agreed to waive its right of codecision on the grounds that a unanimous Council resolution had to be respected. No parliament – not even this one – can afford to do such a thing, and so the Committee reaffirmed, and by a clear and unambiguous majority, that Article 95 was the right legal basis. There are eminently clear arguments in favour of that, as Commissioner Schreyer has just again confirmed, and they cannot simply be swept aside.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed Regulation creates an independent structure under Community law in parallel to national forms of association. Article 8 makes it clear that the regulation does not govern the structure by itself, but does so in conjunction with the statutes of the cooperative society in question and the company law of the Member State in which that cooperative society has its registered office.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, then, about superimposing a European model on the fifteen national company models, but about harmonisation, that is to say, the approximation of laws, thereby reducing the legal obstacles to the operation of the internal market. That is what it should be, and as such it should be adhered to!</p>
<p class="contents">While I am still on this subject, please permit me to add a personal note, for, as rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I now of course have to recommend that, tomorrow, this House should vote against all the amendments with the exception of the first, as these are all resubmitted amendments that were rejected by the Committee. That is how it is, and a rapporteur’s duty is of course to reflect the views of his or her committee. What I say, though, on my own behalf is that I trust you will not mind if I vote, with my group, in favour of these amendments, on the grounds that they reinforce workers’ rights. The fact is that, as a Social Democrat, I regard the reinforcement of such rights as an obligation without the possibility of any exceptions, and so I will self-evidently vote in favour of it, even if, when we vote tomorrow, it will be said that I recommend that you do the opposite. Mr President, I would also ask to be allowed to repeat that before the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like everybody else in this Parliament I share those concerns. But I also believe that we have a responsibility to seek to improve the draft directive presented to us, a view shared unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here is a proposal from the Council and Commission concerning workers and representatives on the boards of a European Cooperative Society, and this is a welcome development. The cooperative sector has been waiting 30 years for this legislation, because of the extremely diverse nature of this sector. Obviously it has been difficult to achieve a common position. Even so, 30 years is far too long for the estimated eight million people employed in the social economy across the Member States. I know that many of them are keen that we complete our business here tomorrow and enable the Council to arrive at an early decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The social economy is an important sector in terms of employment in the Union and in terms of gross domestic product. Cooperatives are an important part of that social economy. It is estimated that cooperatives in the consumer and production areas alone have over 78 million members in the Union. By facilitating at long last the formation of European cooperatives and guaranteeing the involvement of workers at board level in such new enterprises we will be sending a positive message to the cooperative movement. This, I hope, will have a particular impact on emerging cooperatives in the accession countries and serve also to strengthen the European social model throughout the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Important amendments relating to gender equality in the selection of workers' representatives, trade union rights and corporate social responsibility have been adopted in committee and I am pleased to hear that there are indications that both the Commission and the Council are favourably disposed towards many of them. We regret that the Commission is unable to recommend the amendments to the regulation which my group are putting forward. But with regard to the level of agreement that we have achieved in relation to the directive, I want to thank the Council and the Commission, the staff of the Employment Committee and the staff of my own group for their assistance. Without the cooperation of all the members of the Employment Committee, we could not have arrived at the unanimous decision that underpinned the amendments that are going forward to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We can look forward to working closely with those involved in the social economy sector across the Union and to further developing the social economy. Other pieces of legislation are required to complete the coverage needed in this area and I would urge the Commission and the Council not to delay further in agreeing what is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I also suggest that they might consider using the Treaty of Nice provision which allows for decisions of this nature to be taken by QMV rather than unanimity. This would provide for codecision with this Parliament in any further legislation they bring forward in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A parents’ child care cooperative is not perhaps a model for a European Cooperative Society, but we have very good experience of cooperative work. The regulation on a Statute for a European Cooperative Society and the Directive on the involvement of employees are inseparable. The Statute concerns how the mechanisms that are to guarantee employees’ right of codecision in European Cooperative Societies are to operate in practice. In the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have chosen to adopt three political priorities. Firstly, the European Parliament must demand a legal base guaranteeing Parliament the right of codecision. Secondly, current provisions concerning the right to information and consultation must be fully respected during the procedure before a European Cooperative Society is registered or restructured. Thirdly, the rights that employees enjoyed before the European Cooperative Society was created must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has warned the Council that it would not tolerate a repeat of the Council’s position on the European Company Statute. The Council has ignored that warning in this case. In order to defend Parliament’s role in the legislative process, and with reference to Parliament’s legal service, those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have highlighted Article 95 of the Treaty as the correct legal base. It is a question of bringing about an approximation between the Member States’ legislation, not of transferring the right of decision from national legislation to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What happened with the European Limited Company has happened in exactly the same way with the European Cooperative Society; the Council of Ministers has, quite out of hand, robbed us of our power of codecision. This is something that we must not tolerate. There is little doubt that the majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market takes the view that, this time, we should appeal to the Court of Justice against the choice of the legal basis. My original agreement with Mrs Gebhardt was that the Committee on Legal Affairs would restrict itself to amendments on the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have an array of amendments to vote on, both to the Regulation and to the directive. I gather that the Commission intends to support the amendments to the directive, whilst rejecting those to the Regulation. I take the same view. The legal issue is, however, a topic of great importance in terms of the future, for one cannot exclude the possibility of the Council of Ministers doing the same thing in other areas of company law – the other types of company are waiting to be dealt with. As far as the Regulation is concerned, we share the view expressed by the Commission, that Article 95 is the proper legal basis. We have already heard that a number of times, but, with reference to the directive on the involvement of employees, I would like to go into further detail. Article 137 (1) (e) is the rule on jurisdiction for informing and consulting employees and provides for no exception to the co-determination procedure in Article 251. Article 137 (1) (f), however, is the rule on jurisdiction for employee participation; it requires a unanimous vote in the Council, with Parliament merely being required to be consulted. In this instance, however, the Council can decide by unanimous vote to apply the codecision procedure. This directive treats both objectives – co-determination and consultation – equally. It is my contention that, in a situation like this, where there are two equivalent legal bases alongside each other, option is downgraded to obligation and the Council’s discretion is correspondingly limited. If this were not so, the requirement for unanimity in the Council as regards the one legal basis would nullify the codecision procedure in its equivalent counterpart. Such a curtailment of the European Parliament’s rights as a legislature enjoying democratic legitimacy is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">An appeal will not put the European Cooperative Society at risk. Firstly, the validity of the Cooperative Society Regulation is coupled to the expiry of the time limit for the transposition of the directive. This period should in fact allow sufficient leeway for the ECJ to hand down a clarificatory ruling. Secondly, the ECJ can be asked to rule that the Regulation and the directive continue to have legal effect. Quite deliberately, then, it is the choice of legal basis that is being contested, not the subject-matter of either the Regulation or the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here in plenary, those of us in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled a number of amendments on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society. We believe that, as far as possible, the procedure for developing a European Cooperative Society must be characterised by scrutiny and transparency. Current provisions concerning employees’ right to information and consultation must be fully complied with. A number of amendments involve guarantees that, right from the start, an express account should be given of the expected consequences for employment of establishing a European Cooperative Society. Employees’ representatives must be given time to submit an opinion before decisions are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the proposal for a regulation concerns the various stages in the life cycle of a European Cooperative Society, such as its establishment, the transfer of headquarters and liquidation, a number of different amendments are required if it is to be possible to apply these principles to the different situations described in the proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of whose opinion I had the privilege of being the draftsman, also believes that the establishment of a European Cooperative Society must not lead to employees’ losing rights they enjoyed before its establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say very specifically, regarding Mr De Rossa’s report, how important it is to emphasise that, in connection with establishing a European Cooperative Society and in cases of extensive structural changes, there should be the right to engage in negotiations concerning employee involvement. All contributions must constitute an ongoing process. Our report also calls for the removal of the general clause according to which the Member States may be exempted from the provisions concerning employee involvement when a European Cooperative Society is established as a result of a merger between two cooperatives. I also wish to emphasise that the employee representatives on the management and supervisory bodies should be chosen or designated in accordance with national legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we are going to have to wait and see what the Council makes of the points we are raising tonight in relation to the legal basis. I hope the Commission will think again about the acceptability of Amendments Nos 14, 15, 17 and 19 on the statute, concerning the inclusion of the consideration of employment effects in the case of a merger, transfer or conversion involving an ECS, because I think they are entirely justifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime I would like to take the opportunity to look beyond the institutional and legal basis arguments and look at the implications these proposals might have for the development of the social economy in a European Union which is trying to deal with a range of profound changes. The globalisation of markets and the decreased competitiveness of traditional sectors call for the diversification of economic activities and an exploration of new means of creating job opportunities. Technological progress calls for a highly-qualified, flexible workforce, which in turn expects a more participative working situation. Increased female participation rates and an ageing population with longer life expectancy increase the demand for household and caring services. These increasing and more diversified social needs, compounded by budgetary restrictions, have led public authorities to decentralise the provision of services or to reduce the range or level of services they are providing.</p>
<p class="contents">The social economy can play a part in meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities arising from these and other processes of change, and in a way can help shape a new model of society and an economy based on solidarity, inclusion and participation on the one hand, and innovation and knowledge on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say these things with certainty because I have been looking back at the evaluation of the third-sector initiative which ran from 1997 to 1998, thanks to a budgetary initiative by Mrs Ghilardotti, who is here tonight. That evaluation underlined the fact that the development of the social economy to satisfy unmet needs could create as many as 120 000 jobs in the United Kingdom, 380 000 in Germany and 100 000 in France.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps one statistic from the evaluation best illustrates the potential scale of future job creation relating to communal services: the gap between employment rates in the USA and the EU is largest in communal services, which include social services, recreation, education, health and social care. Equalising the rates would be equivalent to up to 7 million jobs. The promotion of the third system could contribute to an increased demand for and supply of these services and one, moreover, which could help close the employment gap most among the very social groups where it is greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a very well-established cooperative sector in my own region of England. It has interests in retail, manufacturing, services, farming, housing, banking and a wide range of other areas. The sector in my own region provides 13 000 jobs in the north-east of England. I know that many there will welcome these new instruments as opening the way for a fresh boost to the social economy and employment through transnational developments. That would be particularly useful in the context of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the Commission really ought to look back at the evaluation of that third-sector initiative. It supported us at the time and there was much talk of mainstreaming the results into the ESF, ERDF and relevant programmes. Yet just four and a half years later I was deeply disappointed to see that the modest reference to the social economy under the enterprise pillar of the old employment guidelines had completely disappeared under the heading 'fostering enterprise and promoting job creation' in the new, streamlined employment guidelines. In this case, new and streamlined does not mean better, and that needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament addressed the issue at a first reading in 1993. I was not then a Member of the European Parliament but was an adviser working with small companies and cooperative societies. My then colleagues and I could not have dreamed that it would have taken such a long time to get to the point where the Statute for a European Cooperative Society was concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">This delay has in actual fact put a damper on a very great many proposals and ideas for cooperation when it comes to the European social economy. Cooperatives are a form of company that should be given every support, especially in political quarters, because they represent participatory democracy in action. We cannot now wait any longer for this Statute. On behalf of my group, I wish therefore to appeal to the European Parliament and to my fellow MEPs to avoid further delays and not to take issue with the Council concerning the legal base and our right of codecision, even though I in principle agree with the reasons presented concerning the legal base. That is because I am afraid that a legal dispute would not benefit the cooperative companies and the social economy. Because there are so many tasks for the social economy in the new Europe, we need this Statute. Do not let it get marooned in principles and disputes concerning the legal base. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a testament to their abilities and initiatives that there was such overwhelming support for the positions that they took. However, like Mrs Schörling, I would hope that we do not get into a fight which would further delay us on the question of the legal basis. As Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out, 30 years is far too long for any legislative proposal to be waiting to be brought about. Whilst we have to pick our fights or arguments with the other institutions, we also have to keep an eye on the bigger picture of ensuring that we can put in place legislation that facilitates and allows for the fostering of new opportunities within the social economy. That is why I want to give as much support as possible to the rapporteurs and the reports that they have brought forward, and indeed to some of the amendments that have been tabled and which I, like Mrs Gebhardt, believe will improve the text and not detract from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the Commission will understand from this debate tonight that we are not willing, as a Parliament, to lie down and be walked over by anyone. We have in our midst enough innovation, ingenuity and compromise to bring forward positive, new initiatives to ensure that all the peoples within Europe can benefit from what we are trying to create here today.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that our legal services have drafted an opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with regard to the ability of using Article 95. However, that opinion is not as cast-iron or as tight as we would like to think it is. Indeed, if we use the analogy of what happened with the European Company Statute, the legal basis is different despite the fact that there are similarities between the two proposals put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that we support Mr De Rossa's opinion with regard to greater employee participation and consultation in the areas of mergers and developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was a Member of this Parliament in 1993. I must say that we had the impression then that this would take some time. In those days proposals did not make such rapid progress as they do now. Perhaps we did not imagine that it would take as long as is now the case, but it has taken a long time. Really this should be a reason for great joy. Everyone has said how important the cooperatives in the different European countries are and it is also very good of course that we can bring about a European Statute for them. This we have always supported. I should also like to warmly thank the two rapporteurs for their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole thing is, of course, not entirely problem-free. That cannot be denied. Because of the difficulties with the European Company we are still confronted by some old frustrations and these frustrations will have to be cleared up at some point. The problem is that the Council never learns. If the Council were to learn, this would of course be an easy debate. We gave it the benefit of the doubt with the European Company and what does the Council do the next time? At the first opportunity it abuses its position again!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there are of course very many people who are then glad to give way, who say that it is an important matter. I agree with that, but I nonetheless think that we must not allow ourselves to be led astray by the Old Testament story of Jacob who sells his birthright for a plate of lentils. I agree with Mr Mayer who says that we must keep it reasonably tight here. I am also totally astonished that the Greens are now suddenly calling on us not to remain true to our principles. I reproach the Greens for actually being too principled, but I am glad that this time we in the PPE-DE Group are more principled than the Greens.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is possible and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have done everything to avoid making this just a debate on a matter of principle. The possibility exists that it will be fought out on principle, but the amendments submitted by us mean that this may not be necessary. The Council can simply adopt our amendments. I regret that the Commission has actually rejected all the amendments to the Regulation, and do not think they have been sensible in doing so. I think that they will have to come back to this at some future time, but the opportunity now is with the Council. This I find quite proper. Let him who sets calamity in motion do the clearing-up afterwards. That is what we are letting them do, Mr President. I think that it could ultimately come to a solution if the Council is sensible, but I personally always refuse to go along with those who keep on wanting to give way. The next time we will have to fight the same fight again because, unfortunately, the Council never learns. The Commission learns with difficulty. The Council never learns. This Parliament learns, but not always. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, more than 10 years after the Commission's attempt to create a suitable legislative framework to regulate the matter of the statute for a European Cooperative Society, the Council is today showing the political will to progress with and close the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this time, however, it appears to have interpreted the relevant proposal for a regulation from the Commission correctly, the legal basis it has chosen is creating tremendous problems. In essence, as other honourable Members have said, it is undermining the role of the European Parliament by selecting Article 308, the simple consultation procedure. Keeping to the same tactic used during the adoption of the relevant regulation and directive on the European society.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments expounded by the Committee on Legal Affairs in favour of Article 95 are right, but it is also right to look at how relations between the European Parliament and the Council are going to shape up in the future. This tactic of discordance of opinions cannot go on and the question is, why is the Council afraid of the European Parliament? However, it is not right for the debate at this stage to be delayed or for the creation of the cooperative society to be put off.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to use every possible means to foster approval both of the regulation and of the directive on the statute of the European Cooperative Society, taking account of the fact that the European Cooperative Society will constitute the necessary complement to the European company. In adopting them, we shall help to develop cross-border cooperative activities in the social work sector which, according to the more general strategy on employment in Europe, will constitute an important source of employment. Cooperative organisations will acquire a strong legal tool which will facilitate the foundation and operation of cooperative societies at cross-border level.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the European company, here too, if we are to be consistent, the corresponding term for the workers must be safeguarded, their rights must be safeguarded and the building of the European social standard must be promoted, in this instance even more so, I think, than with the European company. In this light, I should like to congratulate the two Socialist Group rapporteurs who agreed to proceed jointly and adopt a joint strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">To be precise, the directive needs to take account of the three points that Mr De Rossa raises in his report. First, the right to negotiations on worker participation cannot be limited to the period in which an SCE is being created. This right must be safeguarded during other crucial stages in the operation of the company, such as mergers, transfers etc. For the same reason, the terms of the worker participation procedure must not be a one-off right; it must be redefined if there are substantial structural changes in the European Cooperative Society with fresh negotiations. It is also rightly proposed that, when electing workers' representatives to supervisory or administrative organs, national law should take priority, as in the case of the European company.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude: it is not enough for us to refer each time to our faith in the European social model. We have to sit examinations every day and prove that we believe in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like others I regret the legal base chosen. The arguments are totally unconvincing, in so far as we have actually heard any.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the few things we can say about what we have got in front of us is that we have at long last got some sort of parity here with the company statute. That parity of status in a modern economy is extremely important at a time when many people are looking for added value. I do not see that we should actually be advocating or allowing an advantage to one particular form of company organisation while, as it were, putting barriers in the way of a different form of organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we safeguard cooperatives and their parity of status, particularly at a time of increased competition and threats of globalisation, when there is a considerable threat of undermining the cooperative ethos and its way of operating.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that this is an important sector, not least in terms of the employment opportunities outlined so ably by Mr Hughes. It is also a question about democracy and participation and the feeling of being in control of either your workplace or indeed the company with which you are dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperatives are particularly important when we are talking so much – or indeed today so little – about corporate social responsibility, when we are looking at companies which have a great deal to teach, at major corporations that already operate across borders, in terms of their responsibility towards staff.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome many of the amendments put forward in terms of employee involvement and greater safeguards there, responsibility towards customers, wider society and indeed, for many of them as well, the investment they make in ethical finance, which again has a lot to teach major corporations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, Mr De Rossa, today, this debate on a European Cooperative Society is focusing somewhat on the legal base chosen to reintroduce this report. This legal base has been challenged in all the work of the Parliamentary committees as it arises essentially from Amendment No 1, which was specifically proposed for the text of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation means that, once again, the Members are facing an impossible choice: whether to recognise the rights of this House in terms of codecision or to adopt a Statute which has been awaited for 30 years by the social economy sector. By refusing the European Parliament codecision in this area, the unfortunate precedent of the limited company is perpetuated and this situation could be repeated when we address the statute for friendly societies or European associations. Is the Council going to continue to ignore Parliament’s position?</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first point, my fellow Members have amply elaborated on the grounds for challenging the legal base and they have put forward strong arguments. At the same time, however, and despite everything, it is just as important that we achieve a text on the Statute for a Cooperative Society at last. Although the draft that has been submitted to us represents a backwards step in some respects in relation to the 1993 text, and even though there has been no real debate on the content, I am not sure we need to take the risk of delaying the implementation of a draft which has known many ups and downs. There are many arguments in favour of adopting this text without a delay. I shall cite just a few. The draft has the agreement of representatives of the cooperative sector as a whole, as we have heard. The number of cooperatives concerned in Europe is anything but negligible. Out of 200 000 companies – Commissioner, my figures are slightly higher than yours – in this European cooperative sector representing over 3 million jobs, between 10 and 12% operate outside the local area and their activities concern every sector of economic life. These cooperatives must be able to extend their activities to European level and to be able to do so within a certain legal framework, which safeguards their specific nature, both in terms of the primacy of the individual and the objects of the undertaking on capital, and in terms of participation in the general interest and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and I feel this is an important point – we should allow an economic sector built on the original legal base, which has proven itself in terms of local development, to be able to develop, in particular in countries currently experiencing a sometimes painful economic transition towards the market economy. This is the case of the future Members of our Union. Recognition of the diverse forms of company and the social economy constitutes one response to the liberal globalisation that is being challenged today and is an ingredient of the European social model that we wish to defend. I believe, Commissioner, that we share this concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without getting into the issue of the legal basis, I would also like to thank them for their desire to resolve the problems despite the legal digressions and naturally we expect the same good will from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that the European Parliament has dealt with the issue we are discussing today, the Cooperative Society, in various resolutions. Some of these resolutions are very significant. For example, in 1987, the contribution of cooperatives to regional development; in 1989, the role of women in cooperatives and local job-creating initiatives; or in 1994, the role of cooperatives in the growth of women's employment. If we compare these resolutions with the commitment made at the Lisbon Summit in 2000, and ratified in Barcelona in 2002, we will see that the content coincides to a great extent, equality policies, job creation, etc. In fact, apart from meeting the needs on a strictly local level for clearly local undertakings, all types of company can organise and carry out their activities at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European phenomenon, with its dimension represented by enlargement, determines and defines new territorial rules, in deed or in law, which require a uniform applicable legal framework; and a lack of this uniformity may hinder both the grouping imposed by competitiveness and the operational and subsistence requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, we must not forget that cooperatives are groups of people or legal entities in which people, the personal dimension, are paramount, and must always be – and in fact are – very present. Let us remember – and this has been stressed here – that, by means of cooperative formulae, jobs have been preserved, with the participation of workers, who have played a very important role, and in this regard I would firstly like to stress the right and the opportunity for workers’ representatives to participate both at the time the European Cooperative Society is established and throughout its existence, and in particular at key moments, such as at the time of mergers or restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must stress the need for the maintenance of the concept and the practice of the participation of workers’ representatives, with the special characteristics represented by the existence and co-existence of the competent body of the Cooperative Society and the workers’ representative body.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is necessary to insist that it is necessary and appropriate for horizontal policies, to which Parliament is particularly committed – gender equality, health at work, non-discrimination etc. – to be vigorously promoted by means of the Cooperative Society.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally we must bear in mind that in order to carry out its task, which carries with it rights as well as obligations and an exclusively public content, function or service, the representatives of the workers must enjoy the same protections as the representatives of workers at national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to remember that, as early as 1991, the Council specified this legal basis in respect of the three proposals for regulations it presented at that time, on a European Cooperative Society, a European association and a European mutual society respectively, as well in respect of the original proposal on the European company.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s attitude is even more incomprehensible in the light of its previous actions, and so I hope that it will reconsider its position after the House votes tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection – as the rapporteur has already explained – the aim of the proposal for a regulation on the Statute for a Cooperative Society is harmonisation, to approximate Member States’ laws, in other words to remove all the barriers hindering the functioning of the internal market. It does not regulate matters of taxation or competition – although these are important and will have to be addressed in future – or matters of copyright or insolvency, but merely the structure of the societies, referring systematically to the national law of the country in which the cooperative society has its registered office.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we cannot fail to agree that it is important and urgent that we find a solution for the creation of the cooperative society, given that work on this project has been at a standstill for decades and that it was only in December 2000 that the Council finally reached political agreement on the substance, the content of the regulation and the Directive on Worker Involvement<span class="bold">, </span>which is linked to the creation of the European Cooperative Society.</p>
<p class="contents">Over these years – or decades, rather – the world of cooperatives in Europe has expanded greatly, acquired economic weight and shown that it actually has a key social role to play, particularly in terms of employment. On a number of occasions during these years, the European Parliament has expressed itself, through various reports, on the importance of the third sector for the economy, on the essential role it plays in preserving society, on its proven ability – borne out by numerous studies – to create jobs, not least high-quality jobs. Mr Hughes mentioned a successful European Parliament initiative which revealed the zeal and skill shown by the third sector and the cooperative sector in responding to the challenges of employment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">With the proposed amendments, which I hope will be adopted tomorrow and taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament is enhancing the proposal, introducing into the regulation the changes necessary to harmonise the statute and the provisions of the Directive on Worker Involvement. Information and consultation rights are laid down, to ensure that they are fully respected during the pre-legislative phase and whenever any structural changes or modifications are made.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by congratulating the two rapporteurs for my part too, for they have worked together and developed these two important reports side by side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to put to one side the debate that we are having on the legal basis and talk about the very important issue of employee participation, which should be to the fore for us in the European Parliament tonight. I want to support the rapporteur and the amendments which he has brought forward, in particular in relation to cooperatives that are involved in mergers and in relation to gender balance. Speaking personally, in terms of my work on corporate social responsibility in this Parliament – I am also speaking at the umbrella organisation of cooperatives across Europe at a conference in Paris next Monday – it is certainly true to say that cooperatives are leading the way in terms of socially responsible business practice and deserve the credit for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is about support for workers who are coming together to own and work together in their enterprise for better ends. That cooperative principle dates not least from the work of Robert Owen in my own Member State and is something which we celebrate in this debate. It is also about successful business, which is a core and mainstream part of the economy. Just one recent report produced by the Work Foundation and by Birkbeck College in the United Kingdom showed graphically how employee involvement actually goes together with business success: the two go hand in hand. That is true in my own constituency in the east of England, where we are not simply talking about a very significant part of the economy where cooperatives are active, but also about socially useful employment at one and the same time. For example, there is a leading cooperative that provides care in rural areas in the east of England so that the elderly and disabled are able to get services that otherwise they would be denied and that creates work at the same time. Another example can be found in Harlow, Essex – in my constituency – where we have five separate credit unions, cooperatives that provide money and loan finance which is otherwise unavailable to people on low incomes and with poor credit records. They have over 1 000 members in a town of just 76 000 people. This provides extremely valuable employment indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles in supporting this directive are clear. It is going to give legal certainty and positive status at European level to cooperatives, something for which we have argued for a long time. It is entirely voluntary, no one is made to sign up to this, no one has a European rule foisted upon them. It is a definition, which is inevitably a compromise, of what cooperative enterprise is about, to which the cooperative movement itself across Europe has agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have had a long saga about the European company statute tonight: we celebrate the movement towards the end of the long saga about cooperatives. But I say to the Commissioner and to everyone else in this Chamber: let us move next to the statute on associations, so that non-governmental and voluntary organisations can enjoy legal status too. This entire package has taken far too long. This is an important step tonight, but we must look forward to the next to be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
