<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thyssen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL) </span> Madam President, Commissioner, the report which it is my privilege to present this evening concerns the Commission proposal to amend the sixth VAT directive in order to allow Member States, by way of an experiment, to apply a reduced rate of VAT to labour‐intensive services.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has a long history. As long ago as 1991, we and Parliament first asked for labour‐intensive services, or at least some of them, to be included in Annex H to this directive. Regrettably, the Commission never shared our enthusiasm. It took us quite a few hours of negotiations to persuade the Commission to have a study conducted on the impact on jobs which a measure of this kind might produce. In the end, we had to wait for an edict from the European Council in Vienna before the Commission came up with a concrete proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The question now is what Parliament thinks of the proposal currently before us. Well, Commissioner, we endorse your proposal. Some professional bodies admittedly regret the fact that this is just an experiment of limited duration and not a definitive measure. We understand their disappointment, but we say that half a loaf is better than no bread, and if we cannot convince people with arguments then we will do it with figures, which this experiment will undoubtedly supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because this was an experiment, the majority of the Economic Affairs Committee was happy to accept the general criteria and the fact that the scope of the experiment would not be limited to closely defined sectors. Naturally, we are all happy to say where our priorities lie, especially in the run‐up to the elections. We can focus on the environment, services to families, parts of sectors we include within the social economy, and so on. All these things are laudable initiatives, but it is better not to make any choices here for the moment. That way, the Member States can tailor their experiments to those sectors where they expect to reap the most benefit. The broader the scope of the experiment, the more results it will yield and the greater the chances of sound final measures which will create more jobs on a sustainable basis. That, ultimately, was what we were after.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted seven amendments in the Economic Affairs Committee, Commissioner. We are sure that they clarify and improve the proposal. There are no great questions of principle, except in one respect, that of the authorisation procedure. Neither the Social Affairs Committee nor the Economic Affairs Committee can see why the Commission should not authorise Member States to launch an experiment. The Commission is after all the executive. Perhaps the Council wants to keep hold of the reins itself, and it still has the final say on fiscal matters. So we conceded that, but it is too much for us to accept that the Council can only grant authorisation on the basis of unanimity. That makes the procedure unnecessarily cumbersome. It will inhibit the ease with which the measure can be implemented. It may lead to use of the veto and obstructionist tactics. We find that unacceptable, hence our Amendment No 4. If the Council wishes to act itself, then very well, but let it be by a qualified majority. There are no legal arguments why this should not be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be glad to hear what you think about this, Commissioner, and what the timescale for it might be in the Council. Lastly, I should like to take the opportunity of this, my last report of the current parliamentary term, to thank you for the willing cooperation we have always received from you.</p>

I am happy to say it is the very last time!</p>
<p class="contents">It takes the shine off things a little to have to deal with a proposal which I have always strongly advocated in these kinds of circumstances, and in a ‘like it or lump it" situation. We are so glad to have it at last that one is wary of being overcritical of it. But some criticisms do need to be voiced, not least about the length of time it took to get this proposal. In fact, one might best describe the speed of the process as that of a snail hitting the brakes just before a bend in the road. The approach of both the Commission and the Council was one of extreme caution. I think this was mainly so in the Council, where there seemed to be an exaggerated fear of competition but also that the measure might succeed. It happened to me several times in discussions, especially with German representatives, that they said: ‘Imagine, if this works in the Netherlands, we shall of course be forced by social pressure at home to implement it there as well. Just think what may happen. If it is successful in creating jobs, it may cause a problem in Germany." I never understood that, and I do not feel at all guilty about it. What irritates me most is that it was precisely those Member States which are always harping on about subsidiarity which placed most difficulties in the way of other Member States which said ‘look here, it is not the only way, but it is one we want to try in order to create more jobs".</p>
<p class="contents">When I put forward the proposal for a ‘social" rate of VAT, as part of preparations for the Luxembourg summit – and I was not the first to do so, because an option had already been put to Members of the House previously – I believed that I was acting in the spirit of the Delors White Paper, which had already pointed out that we in Europe had saddled ourselves with a system which made labour extremely expensive, very expensive in connection with our profligate use of energy, raw materials and the totally free movement of capital. To my mind, that is still the central theme and problem in the Union. And I would say, as we address this subject, that Member States have still not done anywhere near enough here. ‘Social" VAT is certainly not the complete answer. It is just a small part of the answer. But it may offer a solution in the area of services at local and regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission once produced an interesting ‘employment rate report" in which it compared the rate of employment in the Union with that of the USA. One of the surprising conclusions was that we did not really lag behind the USA in any area except one, and that was services, services from the lowest to the highest level. I believe that a reduction in VAT precisely in the service sector at local and regional level could be beneficial, and at any rate increase the employment rate. Supply and demand can be matched here. Care of the elderly, jobs for the handicapped, environmental projects and so on – I do not want to impose my choices here any more than Mrs Thyssen, and I leave it to Member States to choose the opportunities offered by the proposal to see what suits their needs and capabilities best.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Thyssen, I too have a few comments on the amendments we have tabled. Like her, I find it totally unacceptable that the Council should have to decide by unanimity on specific authorisation to a Member State to apply this reduced rate of VAT. It means that those Member States which have been obstructive right from the start will be given the ultimate means of being obstructive all over again. I think the Commission has to be consistent here and say that a qualified majority is the only logical legal principle to be applied in approving the system. I am keen to hear the Commissioner"s response.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I was surprised and disappointed to see that the Commission has not kept the machinery for evaluation under its own control, but is in fact transferring this to the Member States and with it the initiative for new proposals. I think – and I appreciate the difficult position it is in at the moment – that the Commission is not really functioning properly here vis‐à‐vis recalcitrant Member States, but it will have to be very careful for the future. If the Commission surrenders the initiative for making new proposals, as it is doing in this proposal, it really is destroying its whole <span class="italic">raison d"être</span> , destroying a guiding principle in the Union, namely the right of initiative. That right rests not with the Council but with the Commission, and that is how it should remain.</p>

The rate of unemployment recently dipped below 10 %, but naturally we are not dancing in the streets because it is still far too high.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament had to put pressure on the Council and the Commission for a long time to get where we are today. But I am glad that we are now able to debate a specific proposal here in the House. We have not yet, however, got as far as approving the proposal. As Mr van Velzen and Mrs Thyssen said, there is a major obstacle. That is the rule that Member State proposals to apply a reduced rate of VAT are required to have the unanimous assent of the Council, even though VAT is no longer the basis for Member States" contributions to the European Union, so the argument always put forward previously that that basis would be weakened is no longer valid.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes no sense these days. I can imagine that one might ask a neighbouring country: ‘Is it a problem for you if my shoe repairer is subject to a reduced rate of VAT?" But why should Finland be able to stop shoe repairers in the Netherlands from being granted a reduced rate of VAT? I really cannot see any sense in that. I cannot imagine anyone taking his shoes from the Netherlands to Finland to be mended. So I really think this is a reversal of everything which Parliament has worked to secure. I think we shall soon see all the Member States opposing every specific proposal, and I find that very disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have already put forward little lists of demands, the Netherlands amongst them. Can the Commissioner say to what extent there is agreement on some of the specific proposals in these lists? For example, the renovation of buildings and shops and certain urban areas is being mentioned. I think a reduced rate of VAT might prevent whole urban areas from falling into decay. Renovation is not mentioned on the Dutch list. Is there any consistency in all these proposals, or is it just up to each Member State to say what it wants?</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur"s approach. Take for example her ideas on evaluating the experiments. The rapporteur wants the specific results of the scheme to be evaluated, including prices, for instance. What we do not want, of course, is to see a reduced rate of VAT bringing not greater demand and more jobs, but simply higher profit margins.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed in recent years. I hope he will show a little flexibility over the amendments this evening. Some of them are very important. He will have another chance to make his point in the Commission on the subject of the Member States. That would be a fine way of rounding off the last five years.</p>

Various speakers have already pointed this evening to the number of times we have pressed here in the House for VAT on labour‐intensive services to be reduced. We realise it is not the instrument of choice for creating jobs. But reducing the rate of VAT will make these services less expensive and enable them to be taken out of the black economy. Whilst the Commission is not convinced that the measure will or may create jobs, research carried out by the Netherlands Economic and Social Institute for SMEs found that it could possibly create 66 000 jobs. That is no mean number! I hope the experiment being launched here will prove helpful in creating jobs. We must not be afraid of negative repercussions on the budget, because look at what a lowering of VAT did for the ornamental plant growers: in my country, sales rose, earning an extra 340 million for the Treasury. But if we are to create jobs, the Member States must above all take structural measures; we have to reduce labour costs, make employment more flexible and encourage part‐time working, and in these respects we see that there is still a long way to go.</p>

<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, for example, the number of shoe repairers was decimated between 1992 and 1998 as a result of the high rate of VAT on their work. Because it was so expensive to mend shoes, consumers tended to throw them away and buy new ones. The extra burden associated with this on the environment may perhaps be reduced if the VAT directive is amended. The number of jobs in this sector may also increase again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the rapporteur for spelling out these effects in Amendments Nos 1 and 2. It is also a good thing to reduce incentives to the ‘black economy". In evaluating this experiment, due consideration must be given to these aspects. I support the amendments which have been tabled, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will do so too.</p>

<p class="contents">In making this proposal, the Commission is responding to a request made by the European Council in Vienna in December 1998. It is certainly true that Parliament had for a long time been asking the Commission to move in this direction. But the Commission did not just get down to work in February 1999: we should recall that back in September 1997 it drew up a communication for the European Employment Council in Luxembourg in which this idea was put forward. It is nonetheless true that Parliament, much earlier on, had been asking us to do this. Why didn"t we do it before? For a political reason of substance: we wanted to avoid short‐cuts in tax policy subsidising employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Velzen is right in saying that this idea of a reduced VAT rate may be one instrument but is not the main instrument. Various Members have pointed out that the best ways of using taxation to boost employment are the energy tax and tax coordination enabling capital taxation to be increased slightly and labour taxes to be reduced slightly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the Commission take until September 1997 to come up with this idea of a reduced VAT rate, which Parliament had been requesting for so long? Because only in September 1997 did we become convinced that quite good progress was being made in key areas. The package of measures against harmful fiscal competition was very close to completion, and was signed by the Member States in December 1997; discussions on the proposal on the taxation of energy products were well under way. At this point we were sure that this proposal for a reduced rate of VAT would be a useful extra factor and not a short‐cut enabling Member States to dodge their prime obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">That was just to explain to you why we acted rather later than you had hoped but nonetheless in line, I believe, with the overall requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not spend a long time describing the proposal; I am glad that as a whole it has been appreciated and supported. I can assure you that the Commission, following these reports and on the basis of available data, will make an overall assessment and if necessary submit appropriate follow‐up proposals after the trial period.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that the Thyssen report broadly supports the approach proposed by the Commission. In substance, the main amendments tabled aim to do the following: stress the directive"s favourable effect on the employment of unskilled or semi‐skilled workers, the environment and also the reduction of undeclared work; stipulate that the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide whether to authorise the application of a reduced rate; and require the Commission to draw up an overall evaluation report, accompanied if necessary by appropriate proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission would for the most part endorse these objectives. However, it is my duty to draw your attention to the fact that authorisation to apply a reduced rate is a measure concerning harmonisation of legislation on value added tax, which is covered by Article 93 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the former Article 99. Under these circumstances I feel it is impossible to depart from the rule that the decision should be taken by the Council acting unanimously. Apart from that, it is obvious that the Commission hopes that the measure will have the positive effects mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should emphasise that if, as I assume, we all want this proposal to be adopted soon by the Council so as to keep to the timetable called for by Mrs Thyssen, involving entry into force on 1 January 2000, I am unable to accept the amendments proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs encouraged me to be flexible. In this case in point, I take flexibility to mean achieving results as quickly as possible and therefore, paradoxically, I shall take her request to mean that I should not accept the amendments, which would just slow the procedure down.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to inform you that, thanks to the German Presidency, today in the Council the working party examining this proposal met for the first time and I think there are grounds for reasonable optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, this proposal, which I hope will prove very good for jobs, will also help to dispel certain doubts about the tax coordination work done by the Commission and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have a situation in which Brussels does not want to claim more powers but to restore powers to the Member States, letting them make the decisions; here we have a case in which coordination of taxation does not mean higher taxes but lower ones, and in which the primary aim is employment. I hope that the Member States will want to use this subsidiarity we are granting them, without hiding, as Mr van Velzen fears, behind an obstacle conveniently put in their way by the European Union in order not to be exposed to the full weight of decisions made under their own responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the support you have given us this evening. Madam President, I too would like to thank Parliament and the Members who have taken the floor this evening for the staunch support they are giving to our endeavours to coordinate taxation.</p>

I gather from your reply that you do not share our view and do not accept the amendment in which we are seeking to have the authorisation procedure dealt with by a majority in the Council, rather than by unanimity. But unfortunately I have to say that your legal arguments have not convinced me. I assume that there are political reasons involved here, but there are no legal reasons. This is an implementing measure, and not a general measure. Legislation must of course be approved unanimously by the Council, under the terms of the Treaty. But I am afraid that is not so when it comes to implementing specific measures. There is a great difference between the two things. If that is the opinion of your legal service, and that is what the Commission officials told our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, then we are not at all convinced, and it might be no bad thing to look at this again from the legal standpoint.</p>

In our view, had we not provided for unanimity we would have had difficulties of principle much greater than those we will have anyway in getting this proposal through the Council. I would point out that, for example, even the derogations under Article 27, which are basically implementing measures rather than new legislation, require unanimity; I would point out the major difficulties we are encountering with the VAT Committee, whose whole purpose is to deal with implementing provisions and yet the Member States are holding out against a rule being passed by a qualified majority. To some extent therefore I can of course share your hope, which is my hope as well, of political realism being applied to an issue which affects employment, a matter of considerable urgency. I had to make a sacrifice when deciding to follow the path we have taken.</p>
