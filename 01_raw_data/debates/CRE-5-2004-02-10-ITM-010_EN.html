In December I asked a question on Croatia. It was held over from the January part-session until this part-session. I thought in good faith that it had been held over because Mr Verheugen was to have been with us at this session and other Members had also asked questions about Croatia’s accession. Nothing of the sort! Furthermore, not only do I find that my question is at the end of the list and not at the beginning, which would have been logical given that it was withdrawn in January, but also I know that it will not be possible to receive an oral answer. And of course I have not been able to ask another question for February.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the services to take careful note of this fact and for it to be reflected in the Minutes of this sitting, because I really do not think that this is as it should be. There are some very dubious goings-on surrounding Croatia’s accession process. Some countries are blocking it and I will name them: they are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We urgently need a debate to clarify all of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, a new phenomenon has appeared: that of the so-called low-cost airlines. The Commission considers this to be a positive development: it increases supply for passengers, results in greater economic activity and possibilities for consumers, and offers opportunities for lower costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s action seeks to ensure that this development continues through the strict application of the rules on competition and State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I must point out that our task is not to support one sector or another, but to provide balanced standards that allow for the development of the various types of aviation activities: the traditional companies with their style of business, and the new companies, described as low-cost companies, which have a somewhat different market and which have undoubtedly generated a significant increase in competition, supply and opportunities for users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport, is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take, as well as on their future development? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the decision taken by the Commission is balanced. It has given the green light to most of the aid received by Ryanair throughout this time. Though it is true that limits have been imposed, in terms of time and above all in terms of the availability of this aid for any other company which is willing to carry out this type of activity, for the sake of equal treatment of all airlines operating in Europe and of transparency in these types of operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, however, that I believe the decision on Charleroi favours regional airports and budget airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that in the case of Charleroi we have not acted on our own initiative, because the Commission had received complaints and because, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission is obliged to deal with them. In fact, there have been complaints in relation to other airports in various countries of Europe. We will deal with them in the coming months, when all the facts of each case are clarified. I believe that we are thereby helping to clarify the situation, because there are a series of other regional airports which, thanks to the response in the case of Charleroi, are going to be able to provide airlines with similar conditions, which allow them to expand and carry out their activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How do you intend to proceed with regard to the state aid that is currently being paid to the railways? Will restrictions on the options apply here as well? In Austria, for example, 7% of the budget is spent on the railways. That amounts to around EUR 500 per citizen in subsidies to the railways, which are now competing directly with the privately-owned low-cost airlines. This means that there is unfair competition between the cheap tickets offered by the airlines and those offered by the railways. I would be very pleased if you took similar action against the railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In each country, therefore, railways operate as the country sees fit and they receive the aid which each country is prepared to give them, in accordance with the criteria of public service and maintenance of companies, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore currently possible that budget airlines are competing with railways, but the latter are receiving State support in practically every country.</p>
<p class="contents">At a later date, following a discussion on the third railways package, which I hope the honourable Members will shortly receive for discussion, and which I hope the next Parliament and the next Commission can complete, we plan to introduce competition into passenger rail transport on international lines, not on national lines.</p>
<p class="contents">When that time comes, we will have to consider the effects this will have in terms of competition, but – I repeat – the aid we have authorised is limited in terms of time and quantity. In no event may it exceed a maximum of 50%, of operating costs and, furthermore, they must be decreasing for a maximum of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a balanced decision, which allows us to combine support for a regional airport, which – I repeat – provides stimulus and economic activity for a region. In the case of Wallonia – an Objective 1 region which is lagging behind the Community average – that is what justifies the support for aid, not whether or not there are cheap tickets. The fact that an airline offers people cheap tickets does not justify their receiving public aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification for the authorisation of public aid at a particular time, and for Charleroi giving it to Ryanair, is the fact that Charleroi is a regional airport in a depressed region, in order to provide that region with stimulus and activity, which is completely different, and as assistance for launching new routes and new connections.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also agreed on the possibility of granting aid in the air sector when the criterion of public service is fulfilled. For example, in the case of the outermost islands and island groups, on grounds of internal public service. In this case too, conditions relating to transparency, competition and equal treatment must be fulfilled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An electronic guide on the subject of the free movement of workers to the new Member States is already operating and can be found on the Commission's website in 20 languages. At the same time, a printed leaflet will soon be available in all the languages.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Member States are concerned, we must make it clear that the Treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the Member States. Again according to the Treaty, the Member States are not obliged to tell the Commission what they intend to do during this stage. Of course, for reasons of transparency, the Commission has asked the Member States to notify their position and I should like to inform you that, so far, the United Kingdom and Ireland have stated that they intend to open the job markets fully, while Austria, Germany, Belgium, Finland and Denmark have stated that they will apply national measures for the first two years. Austria and Germany have also stated that they intend to cite the saving clause in order to limit access to certain service sectors listed in the Treaty. In all events, when we have all the information from all the Member States, we shall notify Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is in regular contact and cooperation with the services of the Member States, so that we can guarantee the uniform application of these transitional arrangements and can also proceed to issue certain interpretative guidelines which have to date been the subject of cooperation and consultation with the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your colleague, Commissioner Vitorino, has also answered this question very comprehensively and skilfully in the past, arguing that the wild numbers predicted for Portugal when it joined the European Union were way off the mark. We are now witnessing the same phenomenon with predictions for movement of labour from the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My point is that I would not ask the Commission to give out information which it has no legal requirement to provide. I am glad of the cooperation between the Commission and Member States. But there is real confusion. The noble aim of enlargement has led to confusion among people on the ground – European citizens – who are now anxious about the extreme predictions of the numbers of people who will come. I do not agree with these extreme predictions, but the Commission has a role to play in giving out sensible information about what we can expect and what it will mean for free movement and, indeed, for benefits regimes – although this is a matter for Member States. That is not coming through collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more positive note, I would ask about movement the other way – people from existing Member States who, for example, would like to retire in Cyprus or work in Poland. We are getting enquiries about that positive element of movement. Will the Commission provide information? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have said repeatedly that there are many independent studies concerning the flow of immigrants after day one of enlargement, working on the assumption that ten newcomers will join Europe at the same time. The overall conclusion of these analyses is that mobility from the new Member States to the current 15 Member States is likely to remain rather limited.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the questions concerning social rights, let me repeat two things. First, from the moment that a worker is a legal worker in a Member State, he or she has all social rights and access to all kinds of benefits and social security systems. As far as pension rights are concerned, during the Italian presidency we agreed on a regulation covering the social rights and pension rights of workers not only from the new countries, but also from third countries. That regulation provides a concrete answer to the question of pension rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, however, late in the day, it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature, in relation to our social security and other systems, that will have a discriminatory effect here.</p>

It has also been endorsed by the new Member States and the candidate countries who have, in the meantime, set up national drug strategies and improved their capacities for taking action against drugs with the support of the Phare Programme. The Union also has a number of drug action plans involving certain regions either producing or serving as transit countries for drugs, such as Latin America, Central Asia and the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Research shows that a link between a particular drug policy line and the drug situation is difficult to establish. The availability and careful evaluation of relevant and reliable information are undoubtedly key elements in developing an evidence-based drug policy. The work of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the work of Europol in this area form part of the basis for the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mid-term evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs. This mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process. By the end of this year we will have the final evaluation. Without wanting to pre-empt the results of the final evaluation, the following developments on the EU drugs market can already be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Heroin seizures have increased since 2001. Our assessment is that street prices are generally stable or even decreasing. The number of heroin addicts seems to be relatively stable in the European Union, although there are marked differences between the Member States. Cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many Member States. The use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and the use of cocaine seem to be increasing in certain population groups, although the use of these drugs among the general population remains low. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed you are right, Mr Newton Dunn, the main responsibility in this area lies with the Member States. But there is a lot we can do, both in internal policy and external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to internal policy, one has to recognise that for years now Europol has been playing a very important coordinating role in detecting the main transit routes. When we have detected the transit routes, we try to cooperate with such countries in order to prevent the entry into the European Union of those drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made some progress in the Balkan region thanks to cooperation with the countries in the area. Thanks to the support of the Cards Programme, we have been developing specific law enforcement capabilities in those countries to fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less positive in my assessment as regards Afghanistan. The figures I have at my disposal demonstrate that the poppies are growing and increasing, and it is quite clear that in Afghanistan the political situation is not stable enough to guarantee close cooperation as far as law enforcement is concerned in order to tackle the issue of drugs trafficking. I believe this issue – and I know my colleague Commissioner Patten shares this view – will be at the top of the agenda in our negotiations with the Afghan authorities in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One concerns the Lisbon Strategy. How does the Commissioner view increased drug use and increased drug misuse in the EU in the light of the fact that, by 2010, the EU is supposed to have the strongest economy in the world, with the highest growth and an ecologically sustainable economy? Is it, as it were, good for the labour market that ever more people are giving themselves over to drug misuse? I also wish to put a follow-up question concerning the projected European Corps of Border Guards. What would be its role when it comes to seizing drugs? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My answer is very clear: no, it is not good at all. Firstly, it is not good for people to become addicted to drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon is developing five key indicators that will allow us to have more reliable data, so that we can compare that data among the Member States and establish a clearer link between the policy line of Member States and the impact of that policy line on the pattern of consumption. These five indicators refer to figures for drugs used among the general population, the problem of drug use connected with infectious diseases, drugs-related deaths and the treatment provided by Member States for those who ask to be treated for drug addiction. I hope that the work in progress with these five indicators will give us a clearer picture of the situation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just add that my concern today is, above all, the proliferation in the use of synthetic drugs and the upsurge of a new profile of drug addict: the poly-consumption consumer. Poly-consumption is a new pattern; it comes from a combination of illicit drugs and licit drugs. We need more research and more reliable information in order to be able to fight against this new profile that has arisen in the last few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">His question concerns the operation of treatment plants in Greece. According to my information, 233 treatment plants have now been constructed in Greece, although 600 would need to be built to meet the needs of all of the Greek municipalities. Most of the treatment plants that have already been built were completed thanks to Community cofinancing, either from the Cohesion Fund or from the ERDF, under integrated Mediterranean programmes, successive Community support frameworks or Community initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the legislation in force for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, the Greek authorities have to declare that these plants are operational when they submit each final report marking the end of the subsidy. However, this same legislation does not give the Commission the power to check itself, after the closure of the programmes or projects, that the cofinanced infrastructure is being properly used and maintained. This task, which is very important and which almost, in my opinion, goes without saying, is the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there is a provision that I can mention today, Article 10 of the Council Directive of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment, that provides that Member States shall ensure, and I quote, that, ‘the … treatment plants are … operated and maintained to ensure sufficient performance under all normal local climatic conditions’. Article 15(4) of the same directive authorises the Commission to request information on the functioning of all treatment plants that have been built with help from the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Mr Alavanos that this is what we intend to do. If anything is amiss then the Commission will take the necessary steps, including possibly initiating an infringement procedure, to ensure that Community legislation is properly applied. Exceptionally, and in particular if treatment plants have been abandoned, the Commission will consider recovering the funds in accordance with current legislation. That is the useful and I think precise information that I wanted to give Mr Alavanos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities have requested Community financing from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds for the project to divert water from the River Ebro. The eligibility dates of the expenditure for the various sub-projects are 29 December 2003 and 1 January 2002 respectively. The Spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the Commission to give its decision before starting these projects, given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the Commission’s decision on whether to grant Community financing. In other words, it is one thing to start the project and it is quite another to receive confirmation of Community financing. If, then, after investigating this project as part of an overall process of reflection on the Ebro – as I said the other day before the Committee on the Environment – the Commission were to decide not to support particular parts of the overall project, the Member State alone would have to bear the cost of the expenditure incurred.

We had a fairly frank and constructive debate on this matter the other day in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, with Mrs Wallström’s agreement, I gave a fairly resolute answer. In my own view, even though, administratively, several different funding sources are involved, indeed several different programmes – regional programmes in Andalusia, Valencia and Murcia, as well as the Cohesion Fund, which are varied instruments that may all contribute in one way or another to funding the project to divert water from the River Ebro – this is one single project and its strategic importance is such as to warrant being examined as a whole by the Commission. This is, I think, a clear answer and is along the lines that you wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we are going to consider any request as part of a comprehensive analysis of the project. I said just now that there was nothing to stop the Spanish authorities from starting work on various parts of the project if they so wished. These parts of the project will have to be carried out in accordance with the environmental legislation. We will check that they are, as this is very important. The Commission also needs to issue a favourable assessment of the Ebro project if Community funding is to be authorised. By starting the work very early, the Spanish authorities are taking the responsibility for any appeals to the Court of Justice for, for example, not respecting current legislation on the environment. There is also a risk that, since the Commission will be making its overall assessment of the Ebro project after work has started, the expected funding may not materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally, that is as much as I can say. I would simply add that the answer that I gave about the overall assessment that we want to make of the project, which is one single project even though it comprises several parts, is, I think, what you wanted to hear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have carried out preliminary studies, internal consultations and economic analyses. The Commission’s assessment will cover all of the technical projects themselves but will also include the economic analysis that will be made of them.

<p class="contents">One of the main elements involved in creating a European area is cross-border cooperation. It has often become clear that it is difficult to achieve proper cooperation because of the difficulties inherent in the various laws applicable in neighbouring countries, and also the lack of a Community public law instrument which would make such cooperation possible.</p>

Like Mr Vallvé, the Commission believes that cross-border cooperation is a key element to European integration. Furthermore, in a different context, namely that of the Convention on the Future of Europe – in which I took part – I have repeatedly proposed that the draft Constitution should provide a sound constitutional platform for cooperation of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, if we are to achieve the harmonious and balanced integration of the entire EU, we must support cooperation, especially cross-border cooperation. This is precisely what we are doing with the Interreg III Community initiative, which contains a Strand A specifically dedicated to strengthening cross-border cooperation. I am also completely aware of the difficulties that authorities at Member State, regional and local level have experienced in putting in place Interreg cross-border cooperation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">These difficulties have mainly to do with the need for partners on either side of a border to respect both national rights and the administrative rules and procedures of their own country. I say this, Mr President, with some degree of experience, as I spent seventeen years as the president of a border region in France, where I was in charge of a large number of projects that encountered the very types of difficulty that I have just mentioned, in my specific case with our counterparts in the Valle d'Aosta in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore provide a stable and shared solution to this problem. The Commission has called for a study to catalogue the problems faced by the authorities in charge of these programmes, with some suggestions as to how these problems may be solved. The results of this study will be made public in the spring, giving the Commission time to propose appropriate legislative measures in the framework of the future regulation applicable to the coming Structural Funds programming period. This legislative proposal will, I believe, be presented in June.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members of your House will be aware that the Commission is to adopt next week, on 18 February, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which I shall be presenting to this House. The report will contain proposals for a reformed and strengthened cohesion policy after 2006. The creation of a legal framework for cross-border cooperation, which Mr Vallvé so fervently wishes to see, must form part of the proposals that the Commission will support in its third report on cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank you for your intervention and to say that I hope that we shall have the opportunity to hear you when you present your report on cohesion, which will not only be about social and economic cohesion, but will now, for the first time, also encompass territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that territorial cohesion will not be possible without a genuine instrument to strengthen cross-border cooperation. It is clear that the cities and the regions, or in France’s case the <span class="italic">départements</span>, have had difficulty in setting up cross-border cooperation programmes, given the differences in legislation that exist between the countries concerned. I therefore feel that it is at European level that we have to design an instrument that makes such cooperation both possible and, hopefully, easy. We await a legislative proposal in this regard, which will contribute towards reinforcing the links between the different countries, in order to dismantle what remains of these borders, described by Robert Schuman as scars of Europe’s history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The World Summit on the Information Society was announced as a major step forward regarding citizen participation. In one of the EU Prepcom-documents (WSIS PrepCom1 document 19/06/2002), the summit itself is seen as a model for the future role of civil society. After the Geneva Summit, the disappointment of civil society actors can hardly be underestimated. In their 'Civil Society Declaration to the WSIS' entitled 'Shaping Information Societies for Human Needs', civil society representatives agreed unanimously upon the following statement: 'At this step of the process, the first phase of the Summit, Geneva, December 2003, our voices and the general interest we collectively expressed are not adequately reflected in the Summit documents'.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission see the participation of civil society at the WSIS as a failure, does it recognise the need to stimulate and increase civil society participation in the next phases of the WSIS and, if so, what initiatives will it take to stimulate an increase in civil society participation in the next phase of the WSIS? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is largely the result of the European Union's efforts during the preparatory committees. Moreover, the summit's executive secretariat set up a civil society bureau organising 23 families in order to facilitate the participation of various civil society constituencies. It even held formal meetings with civil society representatives in Geneva on various occasions. It has allowed a broad convergence on key themes such as human rights, freedom of access to and communication of information, media or gender issues. I personally participated in a number of those.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil society adopted a declaration on the Information Society, which is available on the official summit website. Although the Commission has received rather positive feedback, some civil society representatives could estimate that their views have not been fully taken into account in the final documents adopted by the summit. Even if the proposals of civil society were not fully taken on board in the final documents, the Commission is convinced that they have played an influential role. As was also pointed out by the Conference of Non-governmental Organisations in consultative relations with the United Nations, some common language is emerging between governments and civil society representatives, paving the way for a better understanding and cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must remember that the World Summit on the Information Society remains an intergovernmental process under United Nations rules, benefiting from the United Nations' legitimacy and United Nations principles of representation.</p>
<p class="contents">In its upcoming communication to the Council and Parliament, the Commission intends to propose to convey to the summit's executive secretariat a clear message in favour of a stronger role for civil society and to relay that position in its participation in the conference bureau as well as in its contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the eEurope action plan adopted in 2000 the Commission recommended in its communication that all public websites should follow the web content accessibility guidelines developed in the World Wide Web Consortium’s web accessibility initiative. Parliament took a positive view of this, as is evident from Bastiaan Belder’s report and the resolution taken on it. In resolutions by the Council and Parliament the Commission was asked to monitor progress in order to obtain comparable data.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has followed these recommendations and in the next few weeks will publish a report explaining what has been achieved. The Member States and the institutions of the EU are revising systems so that they harmonise with the guidelines. This has mainly been agreed within the context of voluntary eEurope cooperation. It has nevertheless to be borne in mind that unhindered access to public sector websites will be a long process, as there are a lot of them. It is also to be hoped that organisations for people with disabilities will be actively involved in this. When the time came for me to give our instructions I received 26 emails on the same day saying that Commissioner Liikanen’s website did not meet the agreed conditions. Pressure like this makes it easier to bring about change.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the Commission will naturally look into whether Community non-discrimination policy law needs to be expanded in the future. As a result, this spring the Commission is to begin a public hearing on a Green Paper on future strategy to combat discrimination. The Green Paper will map out the Community’s progress in practising a non-discrimination policy and raise questions to do with policy development. They will include addressing the new challenges that enlargement of the Union will bring with it and laying down policy on action to promote equality in the Union for the next five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European Agency for Network and Information Security</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Agency for Network and Information Security (IT Agency) is reportedly to be located on Crete, a good two hours from the nearest airport in a village with no broadband facility. The Commission previously gave the impression that a location close to modern communications, infrastructure, research and an IT industry would be best for the Agency and the work it is being set up to do. In the light of this information, does the Commission consider it the optimal situation for the Council to be able to take decisions concerning the location of agencies and authorities behind closed doors? Should such decisions not be taken with greater openness so that the factual arguments in favour of the location can be given greater weight? Does the Commission consider that the location of the IT Agency may have a detrimental effect on its work? Will the Agency be able to carry out its work in accordance with the regulation?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, does the Commission consider that it would be more cost-effective and efficient if EU agencies and authorities came under the Commission for administrative purposes?</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States' requirement of one representative per country is in danger of creating ineffective decision-making forums. Should expertise not weigh more heavily in the balance than national interests in such contexts so that industry and consumer organisations get better representation? Is the Commission satisfied with the current situation in which countries without railways are represented on the Railway Agency and countries without sea are represented on the Maritime Safety Agency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Due to its specific nature, the Commission considers that the agency’s basic requirements include advanced and highly secure information technology equipment, support and operations, sufficiently protected against hacking and security attacks, of which it will certainly be a target. This includes the equipment underpinning normal office tasks, as well as the agency's intranet and databases used to store data necessary to the work of the agency, or database-driven applications and networks required for interaction with any national administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, making information available both to the general public, as well as to the specialised audiences will require a properly designed, hosted, operated and protected website.</p>
<p class="contents">The very recent malicious code attacks have yet again proven the need for increased coordination between Member States to achieve higher levels of security. The Commission is convinced that the setting-up of ENISA, with its own legal personality, is the most efficient way to achieve this objective. It favours trust and consequently the direct involvement of industry in its work. This involvement is seen as crucial to solving the information security problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to assure you that the Commission is committed to launching ENISA’s operational activities as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the honourable Member’s questions on the composition and participation of the management board, the Commission, in line with its communication of December 2002 on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, generally favours a small-scale management board. I made this clear in a statement during the Council on 20 November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">However, because of the specific tasks assigned to ENISA and the pressing need for its establishment, the Commission has not stood in the way of a first-reading agreement between the legislators. The Commission has nevertheless pointed out the exceptional nature of the course taken and reaffirms its eagerness to see the general framework applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone who has followed this matter and has heard the demands we have made of the IT Agency perhaps has difficulty appreciating that those demands related directly to Crete. We are concerned that the Agency may be ineffective. Parliament will therefore, of course, apply pressure in this area. We are totally convinced that the Commission can also help us minimise the negative effects of locating the Agency in Crete, which I do not regard as the ideal location. The Council is unfortunately defending incomprehensible positions, for example that such decisions should be made without public scrutiny. To be honest, that is incomprehensible, given the legislation on transparency we have elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by putting a question, not because I cannot work out what the Commissioner thinks but because I want a clear answer, which I intend to use in the election campaign in relation to the governments. Might the IT Agency be more effective with a smaller management or perhaps with a system of rotation? How important is it that the institutions use tax revenue efficiently and thriftily, and how might we bring this about? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: E-safety programme</span></p>
<p class="contents">More than 50 000 people die and 1.7 million are injured every year in the EU in road accidents. This situation is unacceptable. Road safety can be improved by building safer vehicles which also operate more safely. Information technology can be used to achieve that goal. Can the Commission say what stage has been reached with the e-safety programme and what progress has been made in that programme to improve road safety in Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has a real case here, because the number of road accident fatalities in the current European Union of 15 Member States was about 40 000 per year in 2001. This figure is unacceptably high and, therefore, we have the ambitious target to halve this number by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">A wide range of actions are being taken by the EU and the Member States to make this target a reality, with the result that, according to preliminary data, the number of persons killed on Europe’s roads last year amounted to about 35 000 persons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recognised the great potential of the new information and communication technologies in saving lives by mitigating the consequences of accidents or even completely avoiding them. In September last year the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles'. It proposes 11 measures that promote the rapid development and deployment of new active safety systems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The work in realising the actions proposed by the Communication is under way. We have established, together with the industry, Member States, stakeholders and Members of Parliament, the 'eSafety Forum'. Under the forum seven working groups are active on priority eSafety topics. The first results are available in the 2003 Summary Report, which is available on our eSafety website. We would very much welcome the opinion of the European Parliament, as well as a commitment from Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also considering mandating the installation in commercial vehicles of electronic systems whose effectiveness has been proven in practice, such as electronic stability systems for buses and heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is using the Sixth Framework Programme to develop further the technologies for in-vehicle active safety systems. An integrated project, 'Prevent' – which has over 50 partners and an overall budget of EUR 60 million, with about EUR 30 million of Community funding – is the most important project in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see that a very great deal indeed is happening in this area. In the future EU, that is to say an EU with 25 Member States, upwards of 50 000 people will die each year on our roads. That is equivalent to a medium-sized Swedish town being wiped out every year. We cannot go on like this. We have high hopes of IT technology and the eSafety programme. It is a very important piece of work that is going on, and it appears to be at an advanced stage. I also hope that Parliament will express its opinion on the report mentioned by Mr Liikanen.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry has made great progress, but there are big differences between one EU country and another in terms of IT sophistication. Applications such as these require installations both in cars and in the environment. I should like to hear Commissioner Liikanen’s assessment of progress in the various Member States and also in the candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need not only safe cars, but also different types of infrastructure that operate together. We have made certain progress in cooperation, for example the common telephone number 112, which makes things easier in the event of road accidents. It is quite clear that, in this area, we need more pressure from above to organise the cooperation between industry, infrastructure authorities and insurance companies. We hope that the work on eSafety will be of help, and perhaps we could also get the Member States to devote more attention to this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In our first action programme, eEurope 2002, we had a special approach to e-transport, but it was not, unfortunately, able to create sufficient interest among the Member States. One positive thing is that, last autumn, we had a big world conference in Madrid with approximately 7 000 participants. The Member States too showed more interest on that occasion. The Hungarian Government issued invitations to an eSafety Conference in Budapest in May 2004 where we hope for participation not only from IT ministers but also from transport ministers and the authorities responsible for transport infrastructure. If technology and infrastructure are not coordinated, we shall not be able to obtain any practical results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first relates to his views about the likely development of the eCall technology, which will give automatic location of a vehicle after an accident. This seems to me to be one of the most important proposals on the table and the one that is the most feasible. It also builds on our work in mobile telephony.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to ask for the Commissioner's assurance that his services will consider sympathetically, in looking at the Phase 2 standards for pedestrian protection, the major contribution that accident avoidance technologies will make in that improvement in reducing pedestrian casualties. I have just seen results from German tests which indicate that the Phase 2 structural standards may not bring about the sort of improvements that we had been expecting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the Madrid conference we looked at applications developed by the health authorities and car industry, which showed that, when an accident took place, direct contact could be established with the hospital and the ambulance services were able to locate the place of the accident and make direct telephone contact.</p>
<p class="contents">In technological terms the product is now ready. The challenge now is to implement it appropriately. But the first issue has been solved.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second matter, as far as accident-avoidance measures by IT tools are concerned, progress has been made on the research side based essentially on the use of radars or sensors, which help the driver to identify potential risks in traffic, especially during the early evening, often the most dangerous time.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look at the issue in detail in the context of the feasibility studies to be carried out. As we all know, accident prevention is by far the best solution. In any case, pedestrian safety is a priority for all of us and we will stick to the commitments we have made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Independence of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 15 December 2003 the Hungarian Parliament passed a government bill that restricts the ability of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF) to act freely when carrying out its statutory tasks. At the same time, action is being taken to intervene in an ongoing court case that could bring politically inconvenient facts to light. Commissioner Bolkestein has previously made clear in a letter what standards are to be imposed on a financial watchdog. The European Central Bank, like MEPs, has criticised the planned amendments to the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider, particularly with the correct use of European funds in mind, that an independent financial regulatory authority is still in place? If so, why?

I would remind you, first of all, that the bill adopted by the Hungarian Parliament on 15 December 2003 regulates the relations between the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF), the Hungarian Parliament and the Ministry of Finance. The text of this bill is available to the Commission. It states that the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its tasks, which are set out in the bill. Nonetheless, the Ministry of Finance does have the right to be informed on a regular basis about the activities of the Authority and may call on the Authority to cease any improper practices if shortcomings do arise.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of evaluating these two aspects of the bill, I should point out that the explicit provision stating that the Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its legally defined tasks, but that the Finance Minister has the right to be informed about its activities, is in line with normal standards, including those in place in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from this, the Commission has been informed that the bill has not come into force. The Hungarian President refused to sign it, referring it instead to the Hungarian Constitutional Court for review. This review is not yet complete. The need for further amendments cannot be ruled out. Since the bill has not yet come into force, the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority is still operating under the existing regulations and the same administrative council. The Commission considers this an important matter. It is in constant contact with the Hungarian Government on this issue, and given the importance of efficient and proper financial supervision, has requested the Hungarian Government to inform it promptly of all developments in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the general conclusions it is stated that the legal framework for restitution is now fully functional. There is one notable exception: restitutions of churches. This is an incredibly sensitive issue in Romania. The sensitive nature of the problem, together with the problems within and between certain denominations has resulted in a blocking of the planned legislation. The law in Romania applies equally to all Romanian citizens. The Commission is not aware of any special provisions for the German minority. Your question, Mr Posselt, indicates that you may be better informed than the Commission. If there is something the Commission does not know about, I would be grateful if you could let me know. Consequently, I am unable to answer your question as to whether this model could be transferred to other candidate countries. It is hard for me to assess a law we do not know about.</p>
<p class="contents">The selection of the general model for asset restitutions in Romania is a sovereign matter for Romania, and the sole responsibility of that state. As you know, the European Union has no legal authority in this area. Nevertheless, the regular Commission report does highlight the fact that the progress made in actual restitutions varies greatly depending on the value of the assets to be returned. There has been real progress in restitutions of agricultural and forested land, but the transfer of buildings has only just started. Only 3% of the properties in question had been returned by the end of 2003. I would classify that as fairly slow implementation of the relevant legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In essence, that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time. This is why you were right to address the 3% question. Secondly, I believe – during the previous question time, you did state that you are still responsible for minority issues, including in candidate countries – that the Romanian and Hungarian legislation seeks to treat all citizens equally. You know that there have been considerable problems with the Czech legislation, for which there is of course an official explanation. Announcements were made by Mr Mareš and others regarding initiatives intended to improve the situation. Do you know whether anything is being done? Are there perhaps plans to apply these models, or at least to make another move towards reconciliation?

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Elimination of voters from Maltese electoral lists</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 21 March 2003, the Constitutional Court of Malta, at the request of an injured party, gave a definition of 'residence' (the Cassola Case, Judge Tonio Mallia, Case No 6/2003/1: Harry Vassallo vs the Electoral Commission and John Mary Magro). The definition given by the Malta Constitutional court reads: ‘the word 'residence' does not mean physical presence in the country’.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the new law on European elections in Malta, (Act No XVI of 2003, published in the Malta Government Gazette of 26 November 2003) explicitly states that all Maltese citizens living in the 25 EU countries have a right to vote and stand for election in Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the fact that, despite the constitutional definition and the existing legislation on European elections, the Malta Labour Party has again applied to have 1 684 Maltese citizens struck off the electoral register? These court cases will begin to be heard by the Maltese courts in the last week of January, and Maltese employees with the EU institutions are amongst those being targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do against this illegal attempt by the MLP to prevent Maltese citizens taking part in these upcoming European Elections in Malta? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The right of Maltese citizens to vote in general elections depends on their nationality, age, and place of residence. A short while ago, a Maltese citizen lodged a complaint because one party was disputing his right to vote, and the Constitutional Court found that these requirements do not violate the fundamental rights of Maltese citizens. The European Commission has nothing to add to the Maltese Constitutional Court’s decision. I would, however, point out that, according to the Maltese Constitutional Court’s definition, the notion of residence does not require a physical presence in the country, and in fact temporary absences from the country are both included and permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">If a political party in Malta disputes a citizen’s right to vote, the relevant Maltese court has to consider the case and the ruling of the Maltese Constitutional Court has to be taken into account. The right to question the electoral roll and election results is an integral part of all transparent democratic systems. It is certainly not the Commission’s place to intervene in the operation of the Maltese legal system. The Commission would also remind you that the recently adopted law on the European elections in Malta states that all Maltese citizens living in any of the 25 Member States have an active and passive right to vote in the elections for the European Parliament in Malta. This was possible because the Maltese Constitution covers general elections, but not European elections. This is an interesting development, and the Commission has taken good note. It shows that Malta’s increased participation in international organisations is having a very constructive influence on domestic developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are wrong to say that anyone is being struck off the electoral register. In this case, a party has used its right to apply for names to be struck off. This is possible under Maltese law, as I explained, and the decision is taken using an objective legal procedure. As I see it, it is none of our business whether the Maltese system is particularly pleasant. What is important is establishing whether or not the general free and equal voting rights are guaranteed in Malta. They are. It is certainly not the Commission’s place, however, to pass judgment on the actions of each and every party and I am not going to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means we have very little opportunity for influencing Turkey, particularly via legal instruments. For this reason, I would refer you to my earlier response to the question from Baroness Ludford, Mrs Lambert and you on the same subject and repeat that any negative consequences of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline agreement signed by Turkey or the implementation of that agreement will be assessed according to the Copenhagen political criteria. That is all the Commission can do in this case. Our role is to assess whether Turkey has met the political criteria necessary for beginning accession talks. Obviously, this will also include assessing whether or not Turkey is fully respecting human rights. The Commission report to be presented in autumn this year will examine this question, of course. The Commission is aware that a number of non-governmental organisations filed complaints with the Court of First Instance in January 2004. The Commission has not yet been officially notified of the details of these complaints. If asked to do so by the Court, the Commission will submit its comments in line with the relevant procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
