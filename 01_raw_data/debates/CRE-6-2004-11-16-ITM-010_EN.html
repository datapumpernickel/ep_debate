The first is the implementation and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. Member States and the Commission are currently preparing the European emissions trading system, which is due to be launched on 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The second focus of attention is climate policy in the longer term. In December this year, the Tenth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is due to take place in Buenos Aires. One of its tasks will be to assess the results of the Convention over the last ten years and future trends. A very important result so far has been the Kyoto Protocol. But the Protocol is only a first step and CO2 emissions will have to be reduced even more after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to convey the Council's thanks for the efforts Parliament has made to persuade Russia to commit itself to the Kyoto Protocol. The European Union welcomed the good news that on 5 November President Putin had signed a bill confirming ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Federation. That signature clears the way for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force early next year. Once in force, it will legally oblige countries with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach these targets by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto Protocol is the main instrument in the global fight against climate change and a good example of the effectiveness of global cooperation. Leading by example, the European Union has passed legislation. It has already made these provisions legally binding in the European Union. The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol shows that the EU was right in its early implementation of the obligations then expected.</p>
<p class="contents">In spring 2005, the European Council will adopt a position on the EU's future climate policy. The Heads of Government will consider mid- to long-term emission reduction strategies and their objectives. The basic aim of long-term EU climate policy is to limit the rise in temperature to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In preparation for that meeting, the European Commission is currently producing a cost-benefit analysis taking account of both environmental factors and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Action on climate change demands the broadest possible worldwide coalition. I believe that will only be achieved through a dialogue between the European Union and other countries. The European Union presidency, in the framework of the troika, is currently implementing action with key countries all over the world regarding the forthcoming Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and early discussions on options for a regime for the period beyond 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament can also play a significant part in this process by discussing long-term climate policy with parliamentarians from countries outside the European Union, for example at the forthcoming Tenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This event will also mark the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol means that it will now enter into force, and this will give new impetus to the discussions during the conference of the parties in Buenos Aires. The Commission has four main objectives for COP 10, as it is called. Firstly, to take stock of the work done so far. Secondly, to explain what the European Union is doing to address climate change. Thirdly, to advance the discussions on what will happen after 2012. Fourthly, to contribute towards finding solutions for the technical issues on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing is to take stock of what many parties have already done to address climate change. This is also an opportunity, especially for developing countries, to be able to explain that many of them have already taken action and to illustrate the way in which they are the first ones to be affected by climate change. This is important for the political debate in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to explain what the European Union is doing through our European Climate Change Programme as well as the emissions trading scheme that will start from January 2005. The system will also be officially presented to all ministers in an event that we are organising in close cooperation with the Dutch presidency and the Argentine Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective will be to begin looking to the future, at the global regime that we will have after 2012, and to have an exchange of views on the post-2012 framework. Again, this is extremely important in order to involve the developing countries and to show that there is a balance in the kind of actions that we are discussing post-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final objective is to resolve some of the very important technical issues that are still on the COP agenda. In particular, these issues concern topics related to developing countries as well as the balance between adaptation and mitigation. I understand that several round-table discussions will be organised during COP 10.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission looks forward to working closely with the Members of the European Parliament who will be part of the delegation in Buenos Aires. We will ensure full briefing and also rapid transmission of information to the Members of the European Parliament and we hope that you can engage in a lot of outreaching activities during COP 10. Having a strong EU delegation – composed of representatives of all the European institutions at the COP – gives the Union an important opportunity to encourage the rest of the world to take more action now in response to the threat of climate change. With five years' experience of working with Members of the European Parliament, this has been one of our definite strengths, and the fact that we have held joint press conferences, etc. is a sign of strength and good cooperation. I hope that we can continue in a good atmosphere and in close cooperation both at COP 10 and in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have enjoyed working with her over the last five years in the environmental portfolio. I would like to thank her for her particular contribution. My good wishes also go to the Dutch presidency as its term comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is destined to fail as the rest of the world waits for those nations already taking part to fall short of their obligations and so provide the perfect cover for their decision not to participate in the first place. At the half-way point to the 2012 deadline set under the first Kyoto commitment period, the world is engaging in <span class="italic">ex post facto</span> rationalisation, hammering nails in the coffin of attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before we even enter the second phase of implementation. The 'I told you so' mentality is one I suggest we cannot afford.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure is relative. Failure to meet provisional targets – and my own country, Ireland, is currently 16% behind the target set – is very unfortunate. But failure to act at all would be downright catastrophic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, an international panel of experts which assesses the scientific, technical, social, and economic aspects of climate change estimates that we need to decrease our emissions of greenhouse gas by 60-80% on 1990 levels in order for our efforts to make an appreciable difference to rising global temperatures. I know there is debate in the scientific community as to whether the models used by the IPCC stand up, and that debate will continue, but the majority of people accept the IPCC modelling and the projections arising from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Critics frequently cite the fact that under Kyoto the earth's temperature would only be 0.15°C lower than if we do nothing at all. Scepticism and climate change are two phenomena that have become so closely interlinked in the global debate on the future of our planet, that we are in danger of losing sight of the very real steps that have been taken, under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, towards setting a framework for future action to control the impact of human activities on the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">To focus too closely on the negligible quantitative effect of Kyoto, in terms of immediate results of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, however, is to miss the point. Kyoto is only a first step towards addressing global warming but it provides a crucial foundation on which future, more comprehensive and effective policies and agreements must be built. It is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one. The value of the Kyoto Protocol is in that it sets a market-based mechanism to translate environmental protection into economic terms. It puts a tradable price on global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">Once properly implemented and extended to include all the other sectors, Kyoto will provide a flexible, market-based mechanism to spread the burden of paying for global warming equitably across all sectors. It would provide a financial incentive for the development of clean technologies that will safeguard the environmental heritage of future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the main obstacle at this point is diplomatic. We must engage in a continuing and vigorous dialogue with our transatlantic partners in the USA and with Russia where the very name of Kyoto has become discredited. Yes, Kyoto has flaws, but only through working together can these shortcomings be ironed out to the benefit of all.</p>
<p class="contents">On a European level I welcome the Commission's recent stakeholder consultation and hope that we can make our voice heard at the forthcoming COP 10 conference in which I will be delighted to participate. It is time to banish the notion that the future of climate change policy is coterminous with the Kyoto Protocol. The question, and it is an important one, is what comes after Kyoto? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all honesty, I am really pleased that it is you we can talk to today about the EU’s climate policy and its contribution to the climate conference in Buenos Aires in December. It strikes me as a nice finale that you can pass on this climate dossier in the knowledge that the Kyoto Protocol will enter into effect shortly, now that the Russian State Duma and the Russian Federation Council have ratified it, which they did on 22 and 27 October respectively. Meanwhile, President Putin has signed the ratification act and we are waiting for the ratification to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Kyoto Protocol will be able to enter into effect 90 days later.</p>
<p class="contents">My group welcomes President Putin’s decision to join the European Union and the other countries in tackling the greenhouse problem. Europe and the European Commission have played an important role in achieving this result, and congratulations, also to you, are certainly in order. The climate policy can rely on immense support in Europe. Our group is delighted that the European Parliament and the Council of ministers hold on to an ambitious climate policy that aims to fight the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has confirmed its pioneering role in respect of the climate conference in Buenos Aires. I am pleased that Europe has reiterated that support must be provided to developing countries in order to adapt to the effects of climate change. It is not sufficient to say that we will be taking structural measures which will prove effective in the long term. Some countries, particularly developing and small ones, are already being faced with the effects of the greenhouse effect, and they need help.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group is satisfied, it does, of course, remain critical. Pleasing though it is to see Parliament and the Environment Ministers supporting an ambitious climate policy, we should not remain caught in fine rhetoric and good intentions. We should also bring about concrete measures in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As President of the European Union, the Netherlands has a special responsibility to table concrete results. The presidency’s ideas in the environmental field sound good but should be translated into results. That is what the Dutch Presidency will be judged on at the end of the year. It is in Buenos Aires that it remains to be seen whether our fine words will also be spoken and fulfilled at international level. In any event, I hope cooperation with both the Dutch Presidency and the European Commission will be excellent during the conference in Buenos Aires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I heard one of George Bush's climate change advisers telling us, firstly, that climate change was a myth; secondly, that European scientists were all funded by national governments, that none could be trusted and only American scientists were independent; and, thirdly, that Commissioner Wallström had admitted that the whole climate change agenda was designed to ensure that European industry was able to catch up and additional burdens were imposed on American industry in order to allow this level playing field to be established. And all that time I thought the Commissioner was out there trying to save the world!</p>
<p class="contents">In yesterday's <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> I saw that one of Mr Putin's advisers, whom we have heard from before, is still telling us that it is all a myth and global warming will be a good thing! It is like old Cold War warriors coming together again, trying to fight in a more globally warmed arena.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the Commissioner's credit that we have come this far, but we have a very long way to go. We have to ensure not only that we implement Kyoto – which, as we know, will do nothing to combat climate change but will simply slow down the process – but also that we involve developing nations, raise the targets and find ways of changing public policy in ways that are politically acceptable and involve the United States. I do not know how far we will get down this road. I hope at least that, in the Commissioner's new role, she will, over the next five years, at least have the opportunity to communicate a message of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be realised, however, that Kyoto is only the first step on a long road and now is the time to prepare for the next round of reductions in emissions. We need to involve new countries, such as China and India. The EU should waste no time in putting forward, first of all, a proposal for its own long-term targets for reductions in emissions and, secondly, its proposal for a model for reductions in emissions internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for us to be able to prevent climate change turning into a catastrophe, global emissions must develop a downward trend within not more than twenty years, and the industrialised countries must cut their emissions by at least 60% within approximately 50 years. This sounds drastic, but we can manage with a gradual change if we act consistently. By reducing emissions by just under 2% every year we will achieve a 60% reduction in 50 years. Modern sustainable technology will make that possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We need market mechanisms that favour clean technology, such as taxation on energy and emissions trading, but we also need other new measures. One possibility is a reduction in VAT on energy-efficient equipment on the market. This way we can achieve surprisingly large reductions in emissions, if consumers always choose the most energy-efficient option when shopping. In other words, there is still time to prevent a catastrophic change through a gradual series of measures, provided we are determined and consistent, and provided the EU maintains its leading position in international climate policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we all know, the commitments in the Kyoto Protocol are quite inadequate in the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially important for us to enter into discussions with the big developing countries, such as India and China, about the fact that they too must make binding commitments to reduce their emissions in the future, emissions that are now increasing extremely quickly. If this is to be possible, I think that it is important to talk in terms of the fair and sustainable use of resources in the long term and that the only fair long-term distribution of the right to release emissions is one that is calculated for each of the world’s citizens. That is the fair objective in the very long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The American presidential election is, of course, a serious setback for international environmental work, and the United States will probably appear as a global anarchist in the environmental sphere during the next four years too. We do not have time to wait for the Americans, but we know that the day will come when, for both economic and ecological reasons, they will be forced to commit themselves to this work. It is therefore important that the work in which they will be welcome to take part be firmly on course.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use my last few seconds to thank you, Margot, for the work you have done on environmental issues over these five years.

That is good news, not only for those – like you, Mrs Wallström – who have fought for this protocol, but also for those who experience the effects of climate change on a daily basis. In any event, it deserves heartfelt congratulations. Kyoto is a step in the right direction, towards a better environment, but we have a long way to go yet. I would therefore like to call on the Council and Commission, together with the European Parliament, to demonstrate that the EU not only wants to have a strong economy but also a strong environmental policy. This protocol still leaves a great deal to be desired; for example, aircraft emissions should be added to it, and the support base could also be further widened. Mrs Wallström, your new portfolio might prove useful in this respect. The EU can commit to this too. Involving more countries in this protocol also means better control of worldwide emissions. At present, 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 countries are covered. Let us work hard on the remaining 45%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe it is very serious that this has not so far been said out loud. I believe it is essential to insist that the Mediterranean areas are going to suffer most from the increase in temperature, with the extremely serious risks to health that entails; they are going to suffer most from lack of water, from lack of rainfall; from an increase in desertification, from the advance of the desert; from a decrease in productivity. Furthermore, these areas are receiving immigration based on suffering, misery and hunger. It is our duty to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on Europe to opt clearly for strategies to combat desertification and a policy for adapting to climate change, as recommended by the Agency. We must produce adaptable policies, as required by sustainable development. We need integrated strategies and much more in-depth studies and research into the problems we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Organisation, which has implemented a process of combating the desertification of Europe, has said almost nothing.

<p class="contents">The European Union’s strategy for the Buenos Aires Climate Change Conference is of very great importance. The European Union must maintain its leadership and, furthermore, make use of it to negotiate with a view to increasing the number of countries signing up to the Kyoto Protocol in the future. I believe it is essential to work towards including the debates initiated in Milan in the second period of commitments, with a view to incorporating emissions from flights and marine transport, and also to make progress on global commitments for reducing emissions from passenger and goods transport by road, which is currently a big problem in terms of atmospheric pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission should consider producing more measures in the field of energy performance and also of more renewable energy sources because, as you stated on 26 August, Mrs Wallström, if all the public authorities of the European Union were to move over to ecological energy, CO2 production would be reduced by 62 million tonnes, which would allow us to comply with the 18% Kyoto commitments in the field of emissions reduction. Furthermore, I believe that the market requires clear and persistent signals in order to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Commissioner, I believe it would be positive for the Commission to promote proposals aimed at increasing measures in the field of energy performance and promoting alternative energy sources for the second period, and producing proposals is another way to maintain the European Union's leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope to continue to follow this discussion, because this concerns not only the environment but also our survival on this planet and the economic and social consequences that affect us now. Thus, in the years to come, I hope to support and be involved in the initiatives to tackle climate change taken by the Barroso Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall that we very rarely get reports from the Pacific Ocean – the vast expanse of water that covers one third of this planet – but where the effects of climate change are already affecting people living in small island states. It must be said that during all the debates on climate change over the past five years the speeches by representatives from the small island states have been the most impressive, because they can tell us their personal stories of how this affected their lives and the possibilities to continue to live on these small islands.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of people would say that the Kyoto Protocol did not work, that it was flawed, and they would mention its negative aspects. It is not perfect, but what is the alternative to that one international legal framework, which has now been negotiated for ten years? Should we try to become involved in bilateral contacts between one state and another? To solve a global problem we need a truly global solution and framework. I have tried to turn it around and say that it is an ingenious protocol, because it combines sound science and the way the United Nations has put together the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change is unprecedented. Of course individual scientists will question the whole thing – that is their job! However, the fact remains that we have an in-depth knowledge of the problem. With sound science, we have common but differentiated responsibilities, meaning that the rich countries – those who emit eight or eighty times as much pollution the poor countries do – have a certain responsibility. But we involve them all. India and China sit at the same table as the rich countries, so we are able to talk to them and discuss what will happen after 2012. It also means that we have access to the so-called flexible mechanisms, meaning that we will do things in a cost-effective way. We will involve and mobilise different actors and use market forces for the good of the environment. That is why it is ingenious. We will have to revise it and work and change it for many years to come, but it is the one game there is in town in combating climate change. That is why I am also proud of the role the European Union has played over the years and I hope will continue to play. It is so important. For once we can show the rest of the world that sustainable development is possible; that we can find cost-effective means and measures and that we are willing to cooperate with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the European Parliament we have a very ambitious climate-change policy. I hope that will continue with your help. I wish your delegation and our EU delegation to COP 10 in Buenos Aires all the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Kyoto Protocol is off life-support because the Russian Federation ratified it. The country with the highest levels of pollution– the United States- refuses to consider the global need for their ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. I am deeply concerned that the United States has chosen to tackle this climate change issue through unilateral activities. Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If carbon dioxide is not reduced, the Arctic ice cover will disappear. This is particularly going to affect the quality of life of those living in coastal regions and on island communities. That is a scientific fact, not a passionate policy comment on my part.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago. I encourage other Member States to follow suit. Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy. But complacency in dealing with it, is worse.</p>
<p class="contents">My duty as a MEP, is to stress the necessity of climate change protection to: the people we represent, our EU counterparts and our international partners. I urge the remaining countries that have not made their global commitment to combating climate change, to do so, via the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
