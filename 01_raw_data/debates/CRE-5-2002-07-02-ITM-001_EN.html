<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members and those in the public gallery, the European Parliament is aiming to ensure that the Budget for 2003 is a real reforming budget. There are two perspectives at the heart of this. One is naturally the historic matter of enlargement, and the other is the need to reform the European Union in various areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The bulk of the work on the Budget will, of course, take place in the autumn, but we hope to be able to solve a number of important issues at the conciliation in July in conjunction with the Council’s first reading. The document we are debating and shall be voting on today is about providing the European Parliament’s delegation with a special mandate ahead of this conciliation with the Danish Presidency and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The interinstitutional agreement governing these conciliations highlights three areas that are to be given particular attention. These are agriculture, the fisheries agreements and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I suspect that we will not get very far this year on the issues of agriculture and fisheries policy. With regard to agriculture, we are awaiting the Commission’s draft mid-term review<span class="italic">, </span>and many practical details are still missing when it comes to the reform of fisheries policy. Naturally, we shall still be highlighting these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, there are a number of practical requirements which we wish to address, for reform of agricultural policy ought to mean transferring resources from the traditional organisations of the market to rural development. We shall also be putting forward a number of demands concerning environmental perspectives, the prevention of new disasters involving animal diseases, etc. We hope it will be possible for some points to be considered as early as July.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fishing, we shall primarily be requesting all the information on the Council’s plans for the future. We hope to be able to identify the appropriations necessary for us to be able to maintain fisheries agreements with a number of important nations. We naturally hope that this can take place without the drama seen last year when the whole agreement with Morocco collapsed, creating a difficult situation where all the work on the Budget was concerned. We remain conscious of the fact that we also have to keep the promise we made last year of a further EUR 27 million to support the changeover from fishing to other industries in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we shall be able to sort out some of the details pertaining to these issues, but we have also looked into a number of other main points. Let me start with the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We hope to be able to have a serious discussion on the appropriations required, particularly for the EU to be able to deploy a new police force in Bosnia to relieve the troops we have had there. We also hope to be able to bring about a preliminary discussion on a few other important points. We at least need a little more information on the Commission and the Council’s intentions regarding the initiatives in Afghanistan and the Middle East. That is crucial if we are to be able to solve the Budget problems concerning external assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, there are too few resources. The fact that we have too few resources in category 4, i.e. external assistance, is a structural problem. We need some way of providing new resources. That could be done in accordance with the proposals which the Commission has put forward, but which we know the Council dislikes, concerning a special flexibility instrument for external assistance. The European Parliament has also put forward another alternative in this respect – a more active use of the emergency aid reserve. It would be excellent if we could find a solution to this issue in July.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on the issue of enlargement are likely to dominate in July. We mainly have to discuss the administrative resources needed to prepare the EU institutions for enlargement. I want to stress that we are committed to this. The timetable for enlargement must be adhered to. Therefore, preparations have to commence as soon as possible. It is vital to reach agreement on the administrative costs in category 5 in July’s conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fact that we are prioritising enlargement does not mean that we can just automatically add more money for staff and other administrative costs. We also have to be able to show that we can actively implement new priorities, particularly within the field of administration. In the EU, as in every modern administration, we must show that we are able to develop our methods of working, to reprioritise and to become more efficient and modern before we request more money. The Committee on Budgets has therefore decided to reject the use of the flexibility instrument in category 5. We believe that such use is contrary to the rules. It should not be assumed from the outset that we must use flexibility instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the Commission is requesting funding for 500 new posts for the purpose of dealing with enlargement. I am convinced that these posts are necessary, but we must nevertheless ask a number of questions before we simply agree to such an increase. Over 800 people in the Commission are currently working on enlargement, of whom around 300 work for the Enlargement Directorate-General. Once the major round of enlargement is completed, it must be possible to redistribute these resources to work involving the enlarged EU. As such, we need more background information before we can just agree to automatically increasing the number of posts by 500.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the RELEX reform. The Reform of the Management of External Assistance promised as early as 2000 that further reform would be carried out in 2002 along with a review. The Commission’s annual policy statement has promised a further review of the RELEX Directorate-General’s cooperation and efficiency. We wish to see results on these points before we agree to 500 new posts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also launching two new projects –an expanded border region project with SME cooperation across the union and a project on simplifying the administration of the whole EU. This is an extraordinarily important project.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Podestà (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, today’s report, which the Committee on Budgets decided to draw up at the beginning of the year, is intended to reinforce its power of monitoring the implementation of the European Union’s budget. The Committee on Budgets intends this report to discharge Parliament’s responsibility of establishing the Budget of the European Union, a responsibility conferred upon it by the Treaties, scrutinising the correspondence between the budget voted and its financial implementation. This is an essential part of respect for the political priorities laid down each year by Parliament in its financial document, a part which the Commission is sometimes wont to overlook.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets had two aims: to state the situation of the first semester, identifying initial signs of deviation from the budget voted, and to provide the Commission with guidelines for the second semester. The fact that there is no increase in the own resources ceiling during the current period of the financial perspective, 2000-2006, makes it even more essential that these objectives, which will enable us to improve the efficiency of our expenditure, are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to this, Parliament’s scrutiny has revealed two kinds of problem: the excessive and, at times, inappropriate use of the financial flexibility instruments and the poor implementation level for some headings. To give you an idea of the amounts we are talking about, during the current financial year alone, the Commission has already presented transfers of a total volume of EUR 250 million and, for example, more than EUR 2 billion in payment appropriations were transferred during the 2001 budgetary procedure. To improve this situation, the Commission is going to present an implementation schedule as of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This new instrument, called for by Parliament and the Council together, will allow more accurate monitoring of the situation, although there will still be room for improvement. Indeed, we feel that the Commission should present the plan at the same time as it presents the request to the Budget Authority and should, moreover, present the information as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. To sum up, to establish a closer, more systematic link with the appropriations originally voted, assessment of requests should take into account the voted budget, the current implementation, the implementation profiles presented by the Commission, a timetable for the implementation of the remaining amount on the 'donor line' and the investigations carried out by our parliamentary committees. If this information is not deemed to be satisfactory, the transfer request will be rejected. As a general rule, transfer requests which would reduce the budget lines voted by Parliament will not, therefore, be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the supplementary and amending budgets pose a different kind of problem and allow us to deal with unforeseen situations and make the necessary adjustments to the budget when the accounts from the previous financial year have been closed. It was thanks to SAB 1 that a solution was found to finance the Convention. SAB 2, and SAB 3 as well – which will be dealt with today – have, in actual fact, returned to the Member States a total amount of almost EUR 14 billion of payment appropriations which were not spent in the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the track record and image of the European Union, we would like, with this report, to call upon the Commission to present a plan of how the payments cancelled in the 2001 budget can be rescheduled, to present before 30 September a proper assessment of payments in 2002 and to accelerate payments on old commitments or to decommit those and cancel the obsolete payment appropriations. As things stand, for the end of the year, the Commission is forecasting an implementation rate of 100% for commitments and 97% for payments. This was only 72% in 2001 and, if these results are achieved, we will have made real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the next SABs, certainly the reconstruction in Afghanistan and, in all probability, the situation in the Middle East could require additional resources. As regards reconstruction in Afghanistan, additional appropriations may only be used if the Commission is able to demonstrate that the appropriations already entered under the budget lines have been spent properly, taking into account the commitments given by the other donors too.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, this is a somewhat technical report, but it does show how necessary it is for all our parliamentary committees to concentrate on monitoring the Executive. I would like to say that, thanks to the excellent cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs for the budget of the different committees, Mr Färm and I have in recent months created a number of monitoring groups for the various policies. If the situation improves, it will be due not least to the work of the shadow rapporteurs for the budget, which is not always obvious. Thus, in the future, the parliamentary committees will be able to make Parliament’s democratic control over the Commission even more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that, on 15 June, outstanding commitments totalled over EUR 111 billion, which is more than the European Union’s annual budget. Even if this figure is a reflection of the natural distribution of payments over time, a constant effort is still needed from the Commission to reduce the burden of the past. Cancelling EUR 97 million of old appropriations would be an – albeit tentative – step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that, although our cooperation with the Commission has certainly been fruitful in recent months, it may well be that we need to work together more closely to ensure that the final product is more in line with what the Budget Authority voted at the beginning of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is remarkable is the Court of Auditors’ proposal for self-protection against terrorism. The Court of Auditors is following Parliament’s lead in this. We too have stated that we are not prepared to go along with the absurd increase in premiums by the insurance companies which, following 11 September 2001, actually refused to cover the risks of any future attacks. I naturally hope that our refusal will motivate insurance companies to enter into negotiations with us. After all, if self-protection becomes an issue for the medium or long term – there is also enlargement to include various institutions to consider – we will need to re-examine together how we can effectively cover and spread the risks that are related to this for the EU Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Podestà spoke a moment ago about the enormous surplus in last year’s European Union Budget: EUR 15 billion remained unspent. I am not exactly in favour of wasting money or spending it for the sake of it, but we must ensure that we actually honour the promises we have made to our citizens and those in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This surplus is not a one-off. This will also be the case next year. As you know, the largest surpluses were found in the Structural Funds. This is logical, since these are major programmes that need time to get off the ground. Funnily enough, some Member States will argue that it is beneficial to have such an illogical framework as we have now, because they can then expect higher refunds at the end of the year, which is very advantageous to the net contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the same line of reasoning is applied to the Commission’s civil service. The European Union is accumulating an increasing number of tasks, a larger territory and ever more work. However, if more officials were recruited, this would also mean that the work actually got done, that money was actually spent, and I think that this is not the intention of a number of Member States. In my view, especially the net payers are all for making pledges, having too few people in service to carry out the pledges, blaming the Commission for this, and receiving a few billion of this back at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to finish off with a comment on the Färm report. I should like to congratulate Mr Färm warmly on his work and wish him every success in all the work he is yet to do. Needless to say, it is still a general resolution and the ultimate choices are still before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say that my group will be verifying the final Budget against at least three items. Firstly, an assessment of the mid-term review of the agricultural policy. Mr Färm now has the courage to refer to the word ‘reforms’, and rightly so. Secondly, enlargement and thirdly, category 4 - external expenditure. Both of these are concerned with whether we fulfil our promises. If it was up to my group, we would. We do not need any cheap seats in the front row, as long as the ultimate performance is worth watching. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, as Mr Färm has underlined, the purpose of this debate is to prepare the joint sitting of Parliament, Council and Commission prior to the Council's first reading of the 2003 Budget. Its primary concern will be with agriculture and fisheries, but funds for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and administrative expenditure will also have a large part in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">In agriculture, the Commission preliminary draft of EUR 2 billion is below the upper limit. I would like to reiterate that this is, of course, a very good thing in principle, as there must, in agriculture, always be leeway to take account of unforeseen eventualities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Färm for the report on the 2003 Budget in view of the conciliation procedure. In it, you make the critical observation that, if another letter of amendment on agriculture is to be submitted in the autumn, then that might perhaps be brought forward. All our experience of agriculture, in particular, leads us to say that autumn is a much better time than the first half of the year for making predictions as to how much will be required in a year, as overall expenditure is dependent to a very great degree on what happens in the summer months. That can be taken into account in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer to the marked change in the euro/US dollar exchange rate in relation to the Commission's preliminary draft, in which we had assumed an exchange rate of 88 cents to the euro. Now, of course, that has seen a great deal of movement over recent weeks, meaning that the margin in heading 1 for agriculture has already been reduced by between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million. Changes to date in the euro/US dollar exchange rate are thus causing an increase in expenditure of between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, perhaps, briefly mention veterinary expenditure, as there has been criticism of their reduction in the Commission proposal. It is particularly in the veterinary field that the budgetary impact is contingent upon unforeseen eventualities, be they illnesses or epidemics. That is why there has to be a margin available. This line would then be replenished where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The autumn will also see the submission of a document on the adaptation of the fisheries agreement. Let me now again point out – with reference not to category 4, but to fisheries as a whole – that the Commission will now also be putting forward a proposal on reform of the fisheries policy, one that will add EUR 32 million to the Budget heading; these are intended for a programme of enquiries and related measures, so that the fisheries policy – especially as regards fleet reduction – will require a total of EUR 59 million from the flexibility reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly mention the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I am grateful to Parliament for welcoming the increase in funds specifically for the police mission in Bosnia, which is to begin in the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, also like to come to an understanding in the course of the conciliation procedure as regards how decisions may be taken in future to achieve greater financial security. The Commission had indeed put forward a proposal for a specific flexibility reserve, with which the Council found itself unable to agree. I will observe that Parliament prefers what I would describe as the second best proposal and thus goes along with increased use of the emergency reserve for crisis management tasks of this kind. Perhaps we can come to some agreement about this in the course of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall deal very briefly with foreign policy, with regard to which I am already able to announce that the Commission is preparing to use this year's Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 to top up the margin of EUR 70 million, which is still there for foreign policy. Last year, Parliament and the Council left this amount in the margin, stating that it should be used only when more precise information on a programme for Afghanistan became available. All this will be put before you shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something about the appropriations as a whole. Mr Färm had also addressed the question of whether an understanding might already be reached on these. I take the view that it is too early in the day to do this, and that this is due to issues of agricultural policy and, not least, the importance of the euro/US dollar exchange rate for the area of appropriations in general. Appropriations also, of course, require that as definite a basis as possible be available for the purposes of forecasting. This means that more information about the implementation of the 2002 Budget is needed, and this we will, of course, have as the budget year takes its course. Your report, Mr Podestà, is concerned with better forecasting for the necessary appropriations and with the resultant improvement in harmonisation with the implementation plans for the current Budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst being very grateful for your report, I do think there needs to be more in-depth discussion in the Committee on Budgets on what we are actually aiming at. At European level, we have a Budget made up of commitments, which means that there are always commitments outstanding. The commitments still outstanding are not to be equated with late payment. Let me put it this way. The greater part of European funds is spent on infrastructure and investments. Investments cannot be made in the same year as the commitments are entered into. To take the trans-European networks as an example, if commitments in this area always had to be implemented within a year, studies could be carried out, but the actual projects would not be able to be co-financed. That is why commitments are always building up in this area. What is of course important is that the dormant or abnormal commitments should be reduced, and I believe that progress has been made on this in the foreign policy area. Far greater use was made of last year's foreign policy appropriations than had previously been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Administrative expenditure is an important case in point, having featured in all previous debates on the 2003 Budget year. The difficulty is that the financial programming allocated no funds to preparing the institutions for enlargement, even though it is agreed that the institutions have to take steps at least six months prior to the actual date of enlargement in order for their administrative systems to be ready for it. In the preliminary draft of the Budget, the Commission had set aside an amount to cover these measures both in the Commission and in the other institutions. Now, in view of the first reading, the Council has prepared a resolution that the Commission absolutely cannot support. The position is that the Council wants to award itself an increase of 7% for administrative expenditure, and, if certain measures – such as, for example, the cost of translating the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> – are added, the Council is proposing a rate of increase for itself of 12% over the Budget year 2003 and is financing it by cutting the Commission's own rate of increase. Such a proposal is extremely unfair, and the Commission will not accept it. So I hope that an understanding can be reached about this in the conciliation procedure, with the result that this point will initially be left open, also allowing consideration of Parliament's proposals, which are interesting. At present, however, the Commission sees itself as having no option but to prepare to mobilise the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few words on the Supplementary and Amending Budget No 3. I thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Podestà for agreeing to the proposal. This means that the entire surplus is injected into the 2002 Budget, and, above all, posts are created which the Economic and Social Committee needs in order to take on the functions devolving on it from August onwards in consequence of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. The Council cannot hear me now, but I had the opportunity to say in Denmark yesterday what I am saying to you – that I hope that the Council, in the course of the conciliation procedure, will be open to Parliament's arguments, as the mood and openness of the conciliation procedure leave their mark on the general atmosphere in which Budget discussions are conducted and on the course that they take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In agriculture, we are EUR 2 billion below the level agreed in Berlin, which is itself EUR 10 billion below the previous guideline for agriculture, which has not yet been repealed. We are on EUR 20 billion, lagging behind EUR 126 billion. Every year, we repay billions of euro. Parliament must, then, perform its function of making the greatest possible reasonable political use of the Budget that we have been promised. That goes for agriculture as well, and I am grateful to Mr Färm for taking up the essentials of the suggestions that the agricultural sector has made to him.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely in the agriculture sector that there are disputes. Commissioner Fischler takes our suggestions on board while, on the essentials of conversion, going from the first pillar to the second. He wants to convert some of the agricultural budget to be spent on enlargement, but what happens? It unleashes a discussion on savings in which you, Mrs Schreyer, are also participating, and, if I may say so plainly, I consider it a sham debate, as agricultural savings are not at all the point at issue. Not much money finds its way into agriculture and into Europe's rural areas; indeed, to put it bluntly, it flows only in the wrong channels. Great tasks lie ahead of us, and reforms cost money. Once the reforms are underway, we will not be able to get back to talking about savings if we then have an austerity budget in front of us anyway. That means that we have to achieve a balance between the first and second pillars if the reforms are to gain acceptance. We will not support radical cutbacks within the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that it is easy to spend other people's money, and it is clear that the net recipients have quite different ideas about this from the countries that are net contributors. That must be taken into account, but the debate must not be allowed to end up as a perverse discussion on austerity; on the contrary, it must be about the reforms, and not simply a matter of saying that cuts make for the best agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this sense, the new penalties are not an exception and, nevertheless, despite our delay in approving their guidelines, a large number of programmes have been put before the European Commission, which shows that Parliament was right to defend these actions, which promote a direct relationship between Brussels and the regions. I also think that we should provide more advice for the candidate countries on how to put together their proposals and increase the percentage of Community funding.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the line of funding of the European transport networks in this financial year, the level of completion is still very low, which leads us to believe that there may be more interest in some trans-European projects in the Member States surrounding them than in the actual Member State where they are taking place, which will have to be responsible for the majority of the funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, I do not think that it is the municipalities and regions that are responsible for the poor budgetary implementation, given that, first of all, it is we in the European Institutions who have taken a long time to approve and define the guidelines and programmes. We have also allowed very short deadlines for using the financial resources: two years from when they are budgeted. This deadline is very hard for the regional institutions to comply with when they receive Community approval for their projects very late and have to respect standards of democratic transparency for invitations to tender in order to put together the projects, have them approved, find partners, conduct subsequent public invitations to tender for the contract to carry out the work, etc. All this means that it takes more than two years for the work to begin, as the Commissioner said.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not try to erase Community policy aimed at the regions of the Union, but rather we should increase it in order to correct the regional imbalances and, above all, we should listen to these infra-State bodies more, not pass on our own slowness in planning and making decisions to them, and put ourselves in their position, with the problems they have in successfully completing their projects, and help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is equally important to have more precise information on the appropriations earmarked for international fisheries agreements, given the importance of those that were signed last year and the development of new international relations.

I would fundamentally question Parliament's wisdom in doing this in view of the relative emptiness of the Council bench. What we are discussing here is not going to find its way over to the other half of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am nonetheless very grateful to Mr Färm for giving us this opportunity to consider our overall approach to the 2003 Budget year long before discussions on individual Budget lines take place. Let me just make a couple of observations. Firstly, Commissioner, my view of a supplementary Budget by which we return EUR 15 billion – that is far in excess of 15% of our Budget – to the Member States, is that it is somewhat comic. On the other hand, in order to draw up the 2003 Budget, we find ourselves having to mobilise the flexibility instrument to secure administrative expenditure – that is, in one of the areas where it does not belong. Something is wrong here. This has relatively little to do with the requirement that the Budget be true, clear and transparent, or with all the theoretical things we spend our time discussing in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the flexibility instrument was not introduced in Berlin in order to enable the Commission to redeploy funds in anticipation of the Budget being drawn up, but in order to facilitate up-to-date responses to current political challenges. Administrative expenditure is not a current political challenge; on the contrary, it is something that, as a matter of principle, has to be borne by the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also address the issue of civil crisis management. We in the PPE-DE group have great reservations about the creation of any new piggy bank or flexibility instrument intended to be called on for finance in such problem areas. I have little sympathy for the way the Commission is pushing this idea, even though it is well known that the Council will not take it up under any circumstances. This is where we could have done with something more intelligent. We in the PPE-DE group have proposed something that I hope the majority in this House will support, namely that we should allocate Budget funds to this by means of the emergency reserve and also find a road down which the Council can go all the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I will conclude by saying one more thing. I am slowly getting sick of the way we have the same procedure every year for promoting town-twinning. Now you have again decreased the amount of funds allocated to that heading. The Council makes further cuts – we are used to that – and we end up having to top the funds up again. You know perfectly well what Parliament wants, so just put it into the Budget proposal. We should not have to carry on fighting each other like this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this year's conciliation is anything like last year's then I for one have no desire to attend. I can find something far better to do on a Friday than sit there facing the Council. We make our case on the three areas of discussion and the Council then ignores everything. Those three areas are agriculture, fisheries and CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards agriculture we can make the points made by our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture, especially the priorities which they see for agriculture, and we can talk about category 2 and the CFSP. I would like to pick up a point made by Commissioner Schreyer – and this is what I heard through the English interpretation, not the Finnish interpretation – when she said that EUR 59 million would be needed and the flexibility instrument would have to be used. One point is that we do not yet have a common fisheries policy. If and when we do have one, that will be a problem for next year. However, we still have the problem of the EUR 27 million and I await with interest to see what the Council will do with that sum on 19 July. Once we know the Council's intentions, then we can make some decision as to what to do ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is the CFSP. As Mr Titley said, we will be supportive of a lot of the things that have been mentioned, but the increase of EUR 10 million in the CFSP means that something else in category 4 has to give. That is a dilemma for us.</p>
<p class="contents">There are areas where I would hope we can get decisions on 19 July, which makes it worthwhile for me at least to go. That will be on category 5 and probably as regards the category 4 flexibility instrument if there is going to be such a thing. It is obvious that the Council will never agree to a new flexibility instrument, but if we can get some agreement on using the existing emergency reserves in a similar way for category 4, which would be by a codecision procedure, we may make some headway.</p>
<p class="contents">But category 5 is the big area. It is obvious that Council will want us to agree at their first reading to their proposals for category 5. I do not think that is possible but if we could get an agreement as to what we want to do throughout the year, then we can come to some conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also give serious consideration to frontloading for next year in category 5. Mr Podestà's report has highlighted underspends in this year's budget. In category 5 last year, EUR 70 million was underspent. On average in category 5, there is EUR 50 million underspent each year. If we can take the underspends from this year and use a global <span class="italic">ramassage</span> for all the institutions, then we may find some method of frontloading to save the pains of next year's budget.

The package before us reveals the present state of EU budget administration: frankly, it is wretched. A full 16% of the entire budget for last year’s payment appropriations – EUR 15 billion – remained unspent. The implementation of the budget was the poorest on record. The figure for outstanding commitments has risen to EUR 110 billion, which is more than the EU’s annual budget. We are justified in asking whether there is any other organisation in the world which has such a disastrous record regarding the implementation of its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is particularly poor regarding the Structural Funds. A total of EUR 10 billion of payment appropriations remained unspent, and, accordingly, there is an increase in the figure for outstanding commitments. While, at the start of last year, they stood at EUR 38 billion, in one year and four months they increased to EUR 82 billion. This shows that the EU’s structural policy is in danger of collapse unless its implementation gets a new lease of life. The present system does not work. The legislation should be completely revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year’s budget is now beginning to take shape. It has problems with payment appropriations, which are at their lowest level for years – just 1.03% of Community GNI. This is actually EUR 4.72 billion below the ceiling set for the financial perspectives, although the increase in outstanding commitments has been explosive. There was no provision in the draft budget to reduce the RAL.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is administrative expenditure, which exceeds the financial perspectives by EUR 66 million. The Commission is proposing the use of the flexibility instrument with regard to this. My group absolutely opposes this. Administrative expenditure must be able to be kept below the financial ceiling by means of internal transfers and savings. The flexibility instrument is meant to cover unforeseen expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The share it represents of the combined GNP of the Member States is lower than it has been for years. In addition, we all know that a part of the appropriations still remains unspent. The criticism Mr Virrankoski before me made is a portrayal of just how ineffective the Commission has been, and is a criticism I fully endorse. For some reason the Commission is allowed to execute programmes that are important for the Commission and not execute programmes that are important for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The interinstitutional agreement on the budget was concluded just before this Parliament’s term began. Certain restrictions that go back to that time are making it difficult to draft next year’s budget. The areas that are causing problems are category 4, which deals with external action, and category 5, which deals with the administrative expenditure of the institutions. As we know how finances are managed in the EU and we know that a large proportion of appropriations will remain unspent, many of our budgetary problems are mainly technicalities, and not real. We are becoming concerned about matters that do not suffer from lack of funds for their implementation. Category 4 contains ‘RAL air’ and there is much scope for flexibility in category 5 without it being necessary to increase it by introducing the so-called flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Our real problems are connected with enlargement. With current levels of expenditure the EU is still not ready for enlargement in 2004. We lack the proper language skills and workspace. The EU saves money all the time it does not enlarge. Appropriations were set aside for enlargement under Agenda 2000. These have not been used, as enlargement is to start later than planned. The use of this money for enlargement when it takes place should be safeguarded, but, technically, from the EU’s point of view, it is money that has been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">The share of appropriations that are the Council’s responsibility in the area of the common foreign and security policy is increasing, and we should furthermore introduce a proper auditing and discharge procedure with regard to the Council’s budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware of the difficulties involved in the management of the budgetary procedure and the pressure on those who are responsible for it each year. If I might venture an opinion, however, the situation this year appears to be much more complex and problematic. In theory, it is two years until enlargement actually takes place but, in reality, the machine has already been set in motion and funds will have to be set aside from the 2003 budget to finance the changes necessary, especially at administrative level. We all know that we are not ready, that our budget is inadequate to deal with the current situation, that it is inadequate for the financial perspective for the current period and will leave us at the mercy of any unforeseen developments. That is why I feel that we Members must be bold and demand a political response to the current impasse during the conciliation procedure, not accounting tricks or half promises, which are unworthy of our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is tedious to go over the same ground again and again but, at the risk of seeming extremely boring, I would stress once again my position, which is based on one major assumption: we Members of Parliament and our institution have exactly the same dignity, as a branch of the Budgetary Authority, as the Council, and this means that we are by no means bound to bow to the decisions of the Council without making our mark. There is no law saying that our role is merely to limit the damage done by a short-sighted political structure which is only more powerful in its own opinion: we are politically and morally accountable to millions of the European electorate for our financial management of the Union, and we are certainly not going to say to our citizens ‘We knew all along and we said so at the time but the Council would not listen’. This is why I would stress that, even now and especially considering the heading 5 problems facing us and more long-standing problems such as the RAL, we must force the Council to find a political solution and follow it through as necessary. It is better to be bold now than to be sorry later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the EU were the right body to take over an ever-increasing number of tasks from the national governments (which it is not!), the implementation of the Budget belies this increase in funds. As a result of a stagnating implementation of Community policy, the monies claimed back by the Member States in 2001 amounted to no less than EUR 15 billion on balance. Surely, this discovery should set off alarm bells.</p>
<p class="contents">As paragraph 26 of the Podestà report states, payments lag behind outstanding commitments by such a margin that the total payments yet to be made exceed the European Union’s total annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not conclude in all honesty that the Commission apparatchiks are unable to manage effectively all these commitments, with which the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission over the past few years? Surely the budget is simply too generous? Mrs Buitenweg's conspiracy theory fails to convince me.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call for the appropriations to be brought in line with the Commission’s implementing capacity and only for effective programmes. The EU should confine its remit to those areas of policy where European action clearly has added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to highlight paragraph 14 in the Podestà report: by 1 September, we want precise information concerning the use that both partners in the peace process make of funds received from the European Union, what control mechanisms are in operation and what penalties should apply in the event of misuse of those funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as many speakers have observed thus far, on the one hand, Parliament and the Commission are asking us to mobilise the flexibility instrument to cover what is ultimately run-of-the-mill, if excessive, expenditure, which means drawing on our last reserves – in terms of covering the expenditure for heading 5, when I consider that we are in a building which we really do not need, I think to myself that that may well be an area in which savings could be made – and, on the other, that we are preparing to make a gift to the Ministers for Finance of our countries, who are in great need of it, of at least EUR 14 billion of unspent funds which, very often, they themselves have failed to use. ‘You can’t fool us!’, as a great Italian comic used to say. In other words, we cannot continue along this path, saying in European Summits that we do not have the money to finance enlargement, reaching the lowest implementation level of recent years, as Mr Virrankoski said, with a ridiculous figure compared with the ceilings fixed in Edinburgh and elsewhere, and then finding ourselves in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that it is on this that our effective credibility will depend in forthcoming years. If the States feel they need the thousands of billions of euro that we return to them each year, that is a worrying, but it is just as worrying that a situation such as this should arise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I wanted to emphasise in this debate in which both the Commission and Parliament have a back seat. The message is chiefly for the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, on the one hand we have under-utilisation of funds, where clearly, with the balance recovered by Member States now amounting to EUR 15 billion for the 2001 financial year, as Mr Färm points out, there is a significant financial and political problem, especially as regards insufficient payments in the Structural Funds. However, as Mr Virrankoski said, there has of course been poor implementation of payment appropriations amounting to EUR 82 billion. Is this because of the matters Mrs Buitenweg raised about Member States not wanting to use these funds? Is it poor procedures? Is it simply rigidity? It could also be related to co-financing, where the monies are not available in the Member States, in which case we need to take some care about the next steps for agricultural policy, because we could find ourselves in some difficulty if we rely on Member States to implement programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a contradiction between external policy and administrative policy. We are actually looking for funds to implement programmes decided by the Council or by our institution in the budgetary procedure. We know that Parliament has not actually approved the Afghanistan funding of EUR 1 billion and yet we see the Commission and the Council gaily going ahead, assuming that this will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the light of these two very contradictory approaches, it seems to me and to my group very logical that we should ask the Commission for more flexibility in the way in which finance can be transferred from one part of the budget to the other, because on one side we have too little and on the other we have too much. Yet, we find the Socialist Group wants to delete paragraph 12. Their speaker should justify why they oppose such a logical approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who knows me will know that this is not one of my usual ritual practices, but I do think Mr Podestà deserves thanks for taking over the task from our erstwhile colleague and general rapporteur for 2002, Carlos Costa Neves, and for taking over the job I started to do in 2001, observing the implementation of the Budget over the course of the year. That is a laborious business and far less appealing that the work on the forthcoming Budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">How the Commission implements the Budget and makes use of its resources for the purposes that we decide on at the end of the preceding financial year deserves proper scrutiny. Looking at the course of a Budget year, one sometimes wonders how closely the intentions of the budgetary authority have been adhered to. A Budget year can positively teem with supplementary and amending budgets and much carrying-over of appropriations. Closer examination reveals that, taken as a whole, the appropriations carried over add up to a redeployment of funds from one line to another totalling some 1% of the total Budget. Not that much, then, one might think. But, as several Members of this House have pointed out, a lot of funds are not spent at all! From the 2001 Budget, the Member States are getting EUR 15 billion back, that is, over fifteen times the total of appropriations carried over.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we cannot generally accuse the Commission of disregarding our policy intentions, all of us together – by which, in this instance, I mean not only the members of the Committee on Budgets, but also the members of the specialist committees – have to support the Commission right through the year and see to it that they do not lose sight of our policy intentions. Trust is a good thing, but control is a better one.</p>

I should nonetheless like, however, to highlight two points: first of all, the failure – already mentioned many times today – to implement the budget for the structural funds. The same problem exists in connection with the Social Fund and, because there is no long-term development of infrastructure in this area, I think this is a matter that should be viewed very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the agencies, of which we are acquiring an ever-greater number. We must ensure that there is no overlapping of tasks when we set up agencies, but we must also ensure that the agencies are able to carry out their tasks and that their budgets for 2003 put them in a position successfully to complete the preparations for enlargement in 2004.</p>

These were the preparations for the coming enlargement, necessary institutional reforms and managing both enlargement and the institutional reforms within the budgetary framework. If, at its meeting in Copenhagen in December, the European Council decides to carry out a <span class="italic">big bang</span>, in which 10 new countries become Member States in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004, this will place extraordinary demands on the system. There is no greater challenge than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its far-sighted policy, the European Parliament has worked long and hard to bring about the coming enlargement. This work will now continue in the 2003 budget. If all this is to be managed successfully, enlargement must be given the greatest priority in all EU institutions and must also have a tangible impact on the ongoing budgetary work. With this in mind, it is positive and encouraging that the incoming Danish Presidency has made very clear that enlargement is its main priority.</p>
<p class="contents">This work must also make inroads in the EU’s own organisation. During this year, it has been expressed extremely clearly, not least by the European Parliament, that each institution must complete preparations for enlargement before 2004. This places particular demands on next year’s budget. The conciliation with the Council in just over two weeks will form an extremely important part of this work, not least regarding the opportunities to reach an agreement concerning category 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What lessons can we draw from this, ladies and gentlemen? That we cannot continue with methods that result in such a massive failure to implement funds. We could also talk about mistakes in provisions or shortcomings in implementation. The truth is that we are talking about the consequences of a structural fault, as our colleague Mr Podestà so rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">Year after year our Group places an emphasis on reforming the working methods in order to achieve greater efficiency, transparency and flexibility in budgetary policies, because that is, to a large extent, what is required for citizens to have confidence in the European plan. Therefore, when we see public debates on financial balances, we know that something is being done wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also shown that it wants and demands a European administration fit for the twenty-first century but, at the same time, we demand efficiency, monitoring and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for next year faces old and new problems that we have to solve, and solving those old and new problems requires, above all, that we use common sense in our decisions. Restricting spending is common sense, as is demanding that the Council curb the increase in administrative costs. It is also common sense that, if we advocate Community agricultural and fisheries policies, financial decisions should comply with the true meaning of those words and that the institutions should honour their commitments. Therefore, the budget for 2003 should fund the second stage of restructuring the Community fleet affected by the expired fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
