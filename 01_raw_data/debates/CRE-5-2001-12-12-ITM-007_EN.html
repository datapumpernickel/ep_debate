<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, over the past few years, conflict prevention has developed into a real ‘feel-good’ concept, to use a traditional Dutch phrase. Everyone is in favour of conflict prevention. Why not? There is always something that can be done with it, and why should it not be included in a list of measures?</p>
<p class="contents">In that way, conflict prevention slowly developed from a priority of and for pacifists, via a kind of interesting subsidiary activity alongside military activities, to what I would call one the European Union’s central ambitions, currently recognised by many. It is no longer a plaything of one group, it has become the central pursuit of the European Union as a whole, and this is also the reason why the time has come to translate much of what has been written to date about conflict prevention – stunning reports have been published over the past few years, also by the European Commission, for which congratulations are due – into practice. Fortunately, we do not need to start from scratch, for notably experience in the Balkans over the past ten years has taught us what the European Union is capable of, and has already done, in the field of conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">As you may know, I am also rapporteur for the Stability Pact, which I always extol as the greatest conflict prevention project. I am really convinced that the coherence in this programme between democracy, economic development and security is an illustration of how conflict prevention has developed from a concept on paper to a very usable instrument in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have outlined three points, and today, I should like to do this again. Maybe the most straight-forward point, yet very tricky in practice, is the cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE. Everyone says that this should be done, that it is positive that it happens, and it is already happening. In a high number of locations, cooperation with the OSCE is good, but all too often, I visit places where this cooperation is faltering. I visited Macedonia recently, with a few fellow MEPs, where the European Union has an observation mission, but so has the OSCE. Cooperation between the two is not really ideal, to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="contents">A week ago in Bucharest, the Commissioner made a number of sound proposals for cooperation between the EU and the OSCE, for example in the southern Caucasus and in Central Asia. In my opinion, it would be good if in future, the Commission could possibly monitor cooperation with the OSCE more effectively than it is doing now. The OSCE often has the same mission and is often active in the same field. This applies to each campaign – including the Balkans, where, once again, things often go well but all too often they do not – in order to better implement this cooperation and this distribution of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point in my report is the European Civil Peace Corps. Once again, one could state with a certain degree of self-mockery that it has developed from a fun plaything of the Greens to a crucial instrument in the EU’s toolbox. I would therefore call on the Commission not simply to be grateful to Parliament for the concept of the Civil Peace Corps, as it did five or six years ago, and do nothing else with the idea, but instead to seize the opportunities now, which I am convinced are presenting themselves, to develop this European Peace Corps and to turn it into a central point of EU policy. This is possible, not only because I, or Parliament, welcome it, but also because in the meantime, experience has been gathered with civil peace observers. The European Union has an observation corps and has observation missions in several places worldwide. Germany and Sweden have experience of training civil observers, and I believe that the time has come for the Commission, for the European Union, to better coordinate and pool this expertise and these people, so that in future, the European Union is not only able to act rapidly at military level, but also when it comes to sending civil observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have come to the third point, which may well be the most sweeping in my report. I would positively welcome it if conflict prevention were to be removed from the remit of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. What do I mean by this? It is no longer acceptable for us to talk about some or other EU policy, for example in the field of agriculture or trade, of which we are of the view that it should serve, for example, to better develop Africa’s economy, while at the same time continue to apply components of that policy – and I would cite the well-known export subsidies – of which we know that locally, in Africa for example, they do not have a stabilising effect. If anything, they mess up the economic structure or hamper its development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer it if in future, conflict prevention, like human rights and the environment, were to become a goal of all EU policy, not only in the external policy area, but also in the area of trade and agriculture, for example. If that is possible, if it is possible to make conflict prevention a central point in all areas of EU policy, then I will be happy, and what I refer to as a hobbyhorse of the ‘soft’ forces will then have developed into the favourite subject of the hard core of the EU’s policy abroad and all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander, (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to concur with the observations made a moment ago by the central proponent of conflict prevention, Mr Lagendijk. I very often share his views in areas of this kind, for indeed – and we should credit him for this – particularly the green sector has very often put forward the idea of conflict prevention by non-military means with great clarity. One could also say that this is very topical in this day and age. The European Union is weak as far as its military contribution to international security and national law and order in countries surrounding us are concerned. This was clear from the difficulties in setting up this rapid reaction force. We got off to a good start, but it is often still in doubt, maybe with good reason, whether this will lead to early results.</p>
<p class="contents">All the more opportunities present themselves to the Union in terms of non-military means. And it appears to me that this also falls more within the competences of the Commission. We have competences in this area. That is why the civil instrument is gaining in importance, notably for the European Union, in the light of the Union’s military weakness and of the topicality of the civil means in controlling and preventing conflicts alike. The cold war is over and the entire security context has changed. Large-scale threats have given way to smaller, sometimes persistent, wars with ideological, Mafia-related and ethnic facets. The flaring up of such conflicts can be prevented very effectively by civil means, certainly when these conflicts recur. This explains the flurry of activity which is also especially being generated by the European Union at the moment in areas of tension or precisely where tension has been averted.</p>
<p class="contents">Situations of lawlessness require a completely different approach and involve the police, government officials, aid organisations, technicians, observers, economists and people who know how the civil society develops. In other words, these situations require a comprehensive approach. I therefore agree with the provoking statement “It should be removed from the remit of foreign affairs”. As far as I am concerned, this means that it requires a comprehensive approach from society. This is what matters in conflict control, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will probably continue to play an important role, but so will other sections of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a country’s development as a whole also very much relies on averting violent conflict. And I have to say that Mr Lagendijk has listed the options very eloquently. He is right in saying that we, for example, should not simply accept the existence of this two-pillar structure, that we should put them back on the agenda and that there should be a budget for the things we intend to do in this field. In my view, the unity of the European Union, particularly in this field, is a direct security interest. We must speak with one voice, even in this field of conflict prevention. We must therefore keep our own activities as governments and as industry in our countries well under control.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the rapporteur’s preference for a peace corps, but I would like to point out that the erratum that I received, which concerns Article 17, is an erratum that is ineffective. Article 17 is still an excellent article and I said with good reason that the peace corps must be developed within the framework of the rapid reaction facility. We have this framework, and I hope that it is maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important topic, and it is certainly not only a Dutch pastime, even if we perhaps give this impression a little bit with the list of speakers, the first four of which accidentally, very accidentally, happen to hail from that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the perfect organisation to play a greater role in preventing conflicts, resolving these or in the subsequent reconstruction. The Community is the manifestation of a broad security concept based on economic and political cooperation and on shared values. This successful model is about to be exported to Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus, and Malta, of course. Activities are under way in the Balkans with the same intention, and the EU is now facing the task of finding itself a useful role in the reconstruction in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, all these actions fall under the umbrella of conflict prevention. Despite this, one can still claim that there is already a culture of conflict prevention within the European Union. There is sometimes still envy with regard to NATO or the military scope of the United States, as if the European Union would need to emulate this position. The military instrument is only one of a whole set of instruments which can be deployed to secure safety. It is used as a last resort. The aim of conflict prevention is to prevent violence or recurrence thereof by intervening in good time, mainly by using civil instruments. If conflict prevention is to become an effective instrument of EU security policy, it must form an integral part of our thoughts and actions. This will force the European Union, more often than is now the case, to anticipate and trace hotbeds of conflict in good time. It also forces the European Union to develop new instruments, such as rapid reaction facilities, and to considerably improve the three pillars. It is easy to think of an example where an effective operation requires instruments from all three pillars. At the moment, this is still often a bureaucratic and institutional nightmare to contend with.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union acquires its strength from the multitude of instruments either available or yet to be developed, including, in a few years’ time, the military instrument. In order to deploy these effectively for the short or longer term, a kind of conflict prevention centre is needed. What is happening where and what are we going to do about it? But ultimately it is also about political will. The European Union is active in many, more or less, unstable areas and regions where the level of conflict is mounting, and the European Union should visibly emphasise its conflict prevention policy, more than is now the case, and report on it regularly. Its ambition should be to play an equally visible role as NATO but then in the field of conflict prevention and the deployment of civil instruments. I believe that most EU citizens would be very proud of such a role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since 11 September, the Americans have come to realise that our responsibility does not stop at our own borders or the countries that are of strategic importance to us. Not only economies are interconnected worldwide, but so too is human suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">We are gaining an increasing insight into the deeper causes of violent conflicts; something which both the Commission and Mr Lagendijk have borne witness to. These include the unjust distribution of welfare, religious and ethnic contrasts, a lack of democracy and bad governance. Solving these structural problems is both crucial and difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Better structures must prevent political leaders from indulging in their unbridled hunger for power and wealth undisturbed. Time and again, it is the masses that are the victims in the struggle for power of which they themselves form no part.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, our generations experience large-scale contact between civilisations, cultures and religions, and this is bound to lead to a lack of understanding and intolerance initially. The cause of this is that cultures and religions take their own values and standards too much for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, believers all over the world not only believe, they know for certain. And if faith becomes an element in ones own dissatisfaction, this can easily lead to disastrous extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">The effective management of conflict prevention and globalisation of value systems is the greatest challenge of this time, and Europe must, in tandem with the United States – that is very important – adopt a strategy which tackles these conflicts at the root.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wishes to strengthen its conflict-preventing role, also in the light of Cotonou, it must be adequately equipped. Resistance in many governments to reinforcing the Commission and its delegations is pernicious for the effective implementation of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Impressive speeches this morning by the Sakharov prize-winners have allowed us to share in the immense grief and also the moral strength of these victims of senseless violence. There is little hope as long as tolerance is regarded as treason and the eye-for-an-eye principle leads to blindness, as is the case in the Middle East and Angola. There is only hope if we actually tackle the injustices, and if tolerance, mutual understanding and intense dialogue all over the world become the leading principles.</p>
<p class="contents">After the economy and science, it is now the turn of moral values to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Conflict prevention, as Jost Lagendijk has already said, means for our Group that all EU policies should be aimed at the reduction and prevention of conflict. It means cutting agricultural export aid, opening EU markets to sensitive products, a trade policy characterised by social justice and, above all, preferential trading relationships only where respect for human rights is guaranteed. There is no doubt in our mind that the Gothenburg Resolution marks a milestone for European foreign policy, yet, despite that, what now matters is that we should not only talk about the need for conflict prevention but also do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that a culture of prevention must be created in the European Union, and that it must permeate all its political dealings. Stopping all armaments exports and supplies of small arms to potential areas of conflict will play a crucial role. Support for human rights and sustainable development must be the core objective of European foreign policy. Conflicts can, though, only be successfully prevented if the civil actors are involved, and so we propose the establishment of a platform for NGOs and cooperation with them. This would mean financial support for non-governmental organisations, but that would be significantly cheaper than armed conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is an issue which affects the very essence of this report: September 11. There is a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ September 11, which brings to light the weaknesses in this fundamentally important approach which the EU has taken towards conflict prevention. I think that we should make it very clear that we need more information on those secret services, which, taking as an example those of the United States, have been supporting a State, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, which have later become a public enemy of the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue of great importance, which also appears in the Lagendijk report, which has not been mentioned until now: that either the European Union chooses to give its wholehearted support to the United Nations and the efforts of the UN to use international law to resolve conflicts, or it will continue to be the world superpower, the United States, that makes the most important decisions and we Europeans will be virtually powerless, only able to put on tiny sticking plasters to cover the wounds that have been inflicted. This is the reason why it is important that we implement what is set out in the Lagendijk report.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect I would like to mention is the importance of the economic dimension, which, there can be no doubt, is the cause of many conflicts, and we have to see this also in a global perspective. For this reason, we have to clarify certain statements, because sometimes wide-scale liberalisation can be a greater evil than the possibility of protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, however, is advised to prick up his ears now, for I was the only nay in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy. Unexpected support from an opponent? Indeed, when it comes to the substance of the report. I appreciate Mr Lagendijk’s integral approach to conflict prevention. Not only with regard to the explicit causes of conflict, but also with regard to the hidden implications of policy that has ostensibly very little to do with conflicts. I therefore endorse the call to the Commission to carefully study the impact of European policy on local conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, where the tasks of the European Union in conflict prevention are concerned, I do not share the rapporteur’s view. Recognising greater international connections, he calls for an extensive role for the EU. I have my reservations about this. Out of appreciation for the report and so as not the create the impression of opposing conflict prevention, I will change my vote against to an abstention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from happening in the first place and in order to do this there is no better weapon than to be able to see it coming. That is to say, to find the underlying causes of war and to work to resolve them. In order to do this, it is essential that we do not take a solely horizontal approach – an approach quite rightly proposed by Mr Lagendijk –, that is to say, one that includes all of the European Union’s common policies, but also a global approach, which includes the whole of society.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view non-structural methods to promote reconciliation are important, above all in those regions emerging from conflict. Without these methods, all of the international community’s peace efforts, or those of the very local communities which the conflict has created, could come to nothing, given that the least dispute can once again light the flames of hatred that had provoked or been the cause of the conflict in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">We need – and I address this particularly to the Commission – to dedicate not only more attention but, above all, more resources to education for peace programmes, along the lines of the work carried out by Mr Mayor Zaragoza when he was the Director-General of Unesco and which Kofi Annan reminded us of a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if control of the arms trade is very important, then so is the traffic in diamonds and raw materials. In this respect, I would also ask the Commission to tell us which methods it intends to adopt in order to improve, and make more efficient, the code of conduct with regard to the control of the trafficking in diamonds, in particular, given that, as the European institutions and the United Nations themselves have reported, on many occasions the fight for raw materials is behind many of the world’s conflicts, especially in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore feel that one of the strong points of Mr Lagendijk’s report is that it sees the point at which a political institution such as Europe acquires legitimacy in terms of conflict prevention rather than military force, and it gains legitimacy in the knowledge, not least, that sustainable, equitable peace must be pursued through politics, certainly not through military force.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly welcome the way Mr Lagendijk’s report sees conflict prevention as a result of Europe’s social policies rather than just the effect of good judicial cooperation, although we must never renounce that. Social policies mean that prevention, the ability to predict, to prevent and to resolve conflicts before they happen must be part of all European Union policies, as has already been pointed out by other Members, and these policies must provide for an investment in terms of both financing and human resources. In this sense, we feel that the number of European Union delegations to other countries is completely inadequate to meet the requirements of the prevention policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lagendijk said, we must avoid development cooperation becoming conflict cooperation, and we must therefore be particularly careful, rigorous and rational in developing all our economic policies. Lastly, I share your criticism of the Council and the Commission for not having accepted in the last six years – and six years is an extremely long time in which countless conflicts occur – the proposal put forward by Parliament at that time to institute a European civil peace corps. We must prevent conflict, and in order to prevent conflict it is often necessary to take risks, and that is what we are asking the Council, the Commission and Parliament to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk, precisely on this symbolic day when we awarded the Sakharov Prize to peace activists from Israel, Palestine and Angola. In my opinion, by broadening our horizons, we retain a sense of realism. We must assess our present actions in the Middle East and Africa, with three million victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we will need to evaluate what we need to do in Afghanistan. We must avoid conflicts, conflicts that become militarised or that flare up again.</p>
<p class="contents">This requires an integral approach, as has already been underlined by many fellow MEPs. In my one and a half minutes, I should particularly like to draw your attention to one aspect in the report, namely the Civil Peace Corps. Commissioner Patten, I really expect you to come up with an initiative. I am amazed at how much money and how many people can be mobilised over the course of a few months to start a war. Could we not work in an equally focused manner, deploy as many resources, people, when it comes to keeping the peace and preventing war? And that is why I applaud this Civil Peace Corps.

<p class="contents">Paragraph 24 addresses the need for increased cooperation between the EU and the UN, as well as between the EU and the OSCE. In this context, I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mr Patten, about his view on the methods for strengthening co-operation specifically between the UN and the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to paragraph 27 on the proliferation of light weapons and small arms and the need for a joint code of conduct for arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to focus on paragraph 28 on the significance of education as a key element in conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a real shame that we cannot have a debate here between the rapporteur and us Members of the European Parliament, as I wonder what view of humanity and what ethic and morals are to form the basis for this work on conflict prevention. Is it not the case that conflict prevention and democracy ultimately rely on reconciliation, compromise and the ability of each and every one of us to tolerate a defeat?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a slightly more personal note, as a member of this Parliament I was dismayed when around 200 Members filed out as Kim Dae Jung was about to speak. One of Asia’s very greatest advocates of democracy and human rights, Kim Dae Jung has paid a very high personal price for his fight for democracy. Two hundred Members walked out when he was due to speak. This is no way to maintain the dignity of Parliament. Rather, it brought shame on this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were moved by the speeches and inspired by their example, but we were also left with an uncomfortable feeling. Uncomfortable because, while there is no doubt that in the European Parliament we have succeeded in identifying the ways to prevent and resolve conflicts and recognise, even before others do, who can promote them, we have lacked the effective capacity to influence such processes. I remember having attended a meeting chaired by President Nicole Fontaine at the beginning of this year, with Commander Massoud. At the time, few people were interested in the visit and we were unable to mobilise sufficient support to bolster Commander Massoud’s position and, perhaps, prevent some of the great tragedies that followed.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the Commission’s communication and acknowledge its work and merit. We fully agree with the strategic principle set out by the Commission, and I quote, “the development policy and other cooperation programmes constitute the most powerful instruments the Community has to deal with the causes of conflicts”. We support the aims of the document generally; however, we also feel, as does the rapporteur, that there are a few vague aspects, possibly prejudiced by the rigidity of the current system of support. We believe priority should be given to a strong and serious effort in terms of interinstitutional cooperation. The specific aspects of this are listed very thoroughly by the rapporteur, whom we congratulate. But I would like to emphasise one aspect: the role of the Commission’s delegations should be reinforced, which also leads us to the issue of the external representation of the Union. The document of the Commission, referring to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentions joint training of diplomats. And my question is: when will there be programmes for joint training of diplomats within the European Union itself? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before 11 September, Afghanistan was on the EU’s list of forgotten crisis regions. I think these are two examples of the way in which we are all too often all too wise all too late. Unfortunately, when it is too late there is every willingness to employ quite fabulous sums on military action. This is in stark contrast to the willingness to employ resources on civil crisis prevention and on peacekeeping. Now, the EU has decided to play an active role in conflict prevention in Africa. That is something I view in positive terms. However, we should also play a more active and independent role in relation to the conflict in the Middle East. That role has unfortunately fallen somewhat by the wayside since 11 September. The Sakharov Prize is not enough.

Of course, the objective is always the same: to suppress the progressive grass-roots movement and advance the interests of big business in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the member of the Group of the Greens, Mr Lagendijk, is not, unfortunately, free of the political, economic and military interventionist spirit. Without doubt, as the rapporteur himself acknowledged today, the right hand of the proposed non-military rapid reaction unit and European police force will be the European army, which the Laeken Summit will be busy preparing in a few day's time. Anyway, an official source in the European Union has already stated that military solutions will be imposed wherever political proposals are rejected.</p>

I would also like to welcome his challenging remarks today about, for example, the civil peace corps which I suspect will continue to be a subject of lively debate. Above all I would like to thank him for what he said about the external aspects of sustainable development. That is a subject on which we should all focus our attention in the run-up to the Johannesburg Conference next year. I hope in particular that Parliament will take a special interest in some of the issues he raised, which are of fundamental importance if we are to be credible on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a topical debate. Mr Wiersma suggested it was a Dutch hobby. I am bound to say that, if it is, it is an extremely good Dutch hobby and I recommend it to every one of the Member States. There is a growing appreciation of the need to reinforce our efforts to tackle the factors that make conflict and violence arise in the first place. In the last century, conflict tended to be between states; I do not argue that sort conflict is over and done with. But in today’s world we face a new type of danger – the failed state, the state that is a danger to its own people and a menace to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be crystal clear. Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism. But in rooting out terrorism, we have to work to make sure that the world is hostile terrain – not fertile ground – for terrorists and those who back them. That can mean taking tough military action, as we do from time to time. But it also means exporting and entrenching democracy, the rule of law and good government; it means liberalising world trade, and using that and our development assistance to shrink the gap between the richest and the poorest, in a world in which the planet's three richest men own the equivalent of the GDP of the 48 poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, the Commission published the communication setting out our new strategy of conflict prevention. It is based on four main objectives. First, we want to make a more systematic and coordinated use of the European Union's instruments to address the root causes of conflict. Simply put, we want to get better leverage from our position as the world’s largest donor and as the top trading bloc. We are starting by integrating conflict prevention into our strategies towards partner countries, taking account of conflict indicators, for example, in our country strategy papers.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective of our communication is to raise the effectiveness of our actions in tackling 'cross-cutting issues' such as trafficking in drugs or arms, the trading of illicit goods, environmental degradation and so on. On all these fronts, the challenge is immense. Let me just take, for example, the issue raised by Mrs Ferrer. The Commission has played, over the last few months, an active role in the Kimberley process, dealing with conflict diamonds. That is aimed at establishing an international control regime for the import and export of rough diamonds. After the political agreement reached at Gaborone, two weeks ago, between the participants in this process, the Commission is now launching the preparatory work for the full implementation by the Community of the control regime in the course of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is to develop our ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises. Concrete recommendations have been put forward, notably to improve the CFSP instruments, such as political dialogue or the use of special representatives. I can only agree with Mr Lagendijk that 'conflict prevention implies stronger commitment and political direction on the part of the Member States, as the Community instruments alone are not enough to resolve all possible sources of conflict'. What is required is a bit more of that old-fashioned commodity – political will.</p>
<p class="contents">At Community level, we have set up, at my initiative, a special rapid reaction mechanism to equip us to respond with the speed that events in the real world demand, but which the Commission’s procedures are not always brilliantly designed to cope with. It is now fully operational, and is proving invaluable in current crises, for example in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Afghanistan where I hope to use the mechanism first of all to provide support for Ambassador Brahimi's team, secondly to provide support for the interim administration and, thirdly, to begin the work of demining.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth message is to promote international cooperation with governments, international organisations and civil society. The honourable Member raised this. Mr Sacrédeus raised this as well. The UN is a key partner here. We have a new framework, agreed by the General Affairs Council in June, for EU-UN enhanced cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management. As recommended by Mr Lagendijk, I am ready to work together with the Council on an enhanced framework for cooperation with the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by giving you one example of what we have we done and what we are doing concretely in a key zone of conflict. I am just back from the Great Lakes region where we had a useful troika mission. Last month, we committed funds under the rapid reaction mechanism to support the inter-Congolese dialogue, to launch preparatory actions for the reintegration of child soldiers and to support independent media or other confidence-building initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In November, we also committed money under the CFSP budget to finance the South African Guard Support Unit for the protection of the recently returned political leaders in Burundi. I was pleased to be able to meet them and have a briefing from them. In the region, we continue to carry out rehabilitation, to deliver humanitarian aid and to contribute to poverty alleviation. We stand ready to finance demilitarisation and demobilisation programmes as soon as they get started.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are, I hope and believe, raising our game. We were starting to do so before the horrific events of three months ago which the honourable Member referred to. But we know now how much is at stake; we know how preventing conflict abroad is vital to our own security here at home. We know that we cannot slacken our efforts, but rather, as Mr Lagendijk has argued, we need to redouble those efforts. That is the very least we should be doing in response to the atrocities of 11 September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
