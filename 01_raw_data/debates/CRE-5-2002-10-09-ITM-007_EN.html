The Committee on Foreign Affairs did not make things easy for itself in this respect. We therefore also postponed our decision until we were able to hold a discussion with the Algerian Foreign Minister, to whom we put questions on a wide range of issues, notably concerning compliance with key aspects of this agreement and especially the clauses on human rights and democracy. This is also an important question for the Council and the Commission. How much confidence is there that these provisions will be complied with? Under Article 2 of the agreement, and with the involvement of this Parliament, it should after all be guaranteed that importance is attached in future to ensuring that such clauses do not simply remain abstract elements of these agreements but form part of an operational policy designed to make sure that appropriate developments genuinely take place in such countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is in our common interest that we should have peaceful and democratic development, based on the rule of law, throughout the Mediterranean region, and therefore also in Algeria. This is why it is right for these relations to be developed in order to enforce such positions. In this context, the Council and the Commission must use all the instruments to ensure that the death penalty is abolished, that genuine cooperation is established in the fight against terrorism, and that progress is made on issues relating to decentralised decision-making structures, taking account of the different conditions within the country, and in particular, to ensure that progress is made on economic and social development which deprives terrorism of its breeding-ground. I believe that these are key tasks, which should be tackled on the basis of this agreement so that it can become a genuinely useful instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is naturally also of interest to us to find out, in view of the European Union's policies, to what extent free movement of persons can genuinely be developed in this area, and, furthermore, how issues such as asylum policy can be dealt with. In particular, of course, we are keen to hear why inter-parliamentary relations do not merit a single mention in this new agreement. I believe that if we wish to promote democratic development in any country, it is extremely important to support parliamentary developments in an appropriate way in order, on the basis of inter-parliamentary dialogue, to set in train a mutual learning process and strengthen a country's democratic development. I would be pleased if the Council and Commission could answer this question. In particular, I am interested in hearing how the current Treaty can be used to promote this development, irrespective of what the Treaty says.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I would like to ask everyone to vote for this agreement. In line with the resolutions which we have tabled in this House, however, we intend to monitor the implementation of this agreement on an ongoing basis and look very carefully at what you, the Council and the Commission, are doing, so that we ensure that our notions of democracy and human rights, as well as the joint campaign against terrorism, can flow into a progressively positive common policy. On this, I ask for your support! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the past, this Parliament has on several occasions vigorously condemned the terrorist attacks and violence in Algeria; it has encouraged attempts to achieve peace and harmony and full democracy through dialogue between all the social and democratic forces; whenever it has considered it necessary, it has condemned violations of human rights in Algeria, of whatever kind, and has supported the increasing vitality of Algerian civil society and its democratic forces; it has urged the Algerian authorities to guarantee that the press remains free, as one of their most positive national assets; it has supported the attitude of the Algerian authorities in favour of economic transition, the renegotiation of debt, the stimulation of internal economic investment and external investment, and has expressed the need, on the one hand, for an open and transparent economy with solid and autonomous institutions, as a basis for the economic and social development of the country and, on the other, for a full democratic transition, essential elements of which would be peace and full respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Algerian crisis is partly the result of the events of 1991, of continued intermittent terrorism which has led to a civil confrontation which has probably caused a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand deaths in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a mistake, however, from our European perspective, to see the Algerian crisis solely as the result of the horrendous terrorism that has taken place in that country. In fact, there are fundamental democratic issues and also, above all, problems resulting from the economic and social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs Algeria for its creation of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership that turns our southern flank into an area of stability, peace and shared progress in which there is convergence between the economic and social situations of the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Algeria also needs Europe. Three and a half million Algerians live in the countries of the European Union and, from all points of view, the link between Europe and Algeria must be reinforced by means of an approach involving, on the one hand, a social and economic development objective based on the partnership, but also cooperation in the difficult tasks of achieving peace in Algeria, the eradication of terrorism and all types of violence and the full establishment of civil liberties and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the conclusion of the Association agreement between the European Union and Algeria deserves the full, and possibly unanimous, support of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association agreement must be a basic instrument to guarantee cooperation in essential areas of economic and social development in Algeria, but also an instrument available to us which we must be able to use, without interference but firmly, to achieve the greatest possible influence on the development of this great country towards peace, harmony amongst its citizens, the eradication of terrorism and all types of violence, the affirmation of human rights and progress in the civil and democratic field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the Council’s view that the signing of this agreement clearly shows that, in order to stimulate trade and investment, the Algerian authorities have a desire to maintain and step up their efforts on behalf of the necessary reform process. That ought also to find expression in political and social reforms. A clear signal is also being sent to investors to the effect that Algeria undertakes to create a constructive environment for international enterprises. It is primarily a question of intergovernmental relations, but the agreement also provides a framework for the commercial world and civil society. The agreement is also of significance for the EU’s entire Mediterranean policy, and it is a further step towards setting up a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area. The purpose of the agreement is also to promote that sub-regional cooperation between the Mediterranean partners themselves that is so important to a positive outcome of the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">The association agreement contains an article on the movement of persons, and the EU has in this way pledged to look into the possibility of simplifying and speeding up the procedures for issuing visas to certain persons. This provision must find expression in the implementation rules for the agreement. Once the agreement has come into force, the bodies set up under it will have to investigate how it will be possible to implement this pledge concerning visas, taking account of course of the EU’s policy at the relevant time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to respect for human rights, the Council is monitoring very carefully the issues relating to respect for human rights in Algeria, and specifically within the political dialogue with Algeria that has taken place at ministerial level since 1997. In this way, the Council, which is represented in the troika, is given the opportunity regularly to address these issues and vigorously to emphasise that there must be no violation or abuse of human rights, including in connection with combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The association agreement will now provide greater opportunities for following up this issue and for supporting the Algerian authorities in this connection. I would point out that, as is well known, the agreement makes respect for human rights an essential feature forming the basis of the parties’ external and internal policies. It also provides an institutional framework for regular political dialogue at different levels, and specifically at Association Council level, concerning all subjects of common interest. As long as respect for human rights is a problem in Algeria, the issue will be on the agendas of the joint meetings. As soon as the agreement has come into force, that will apply both to the political dialogue, established in 1997, and to the bodies concerned with the agreement, namely the Association Council and the Association Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not intend to take any steps concerning the situation in Kabylia, for it regards the matter as being in the first place an internal Algerian issue. However, the Council looks favourably upon the important decision taken recently to give the Tamazight language the status of a national language.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 2001, the Gothenburg European Council made it an urgent matter generally to call upon all those in responsible positions in Algeria to make efforts to bring the present confrontations and violence to an end. It encouraged the authorities to launch a political initiative to solve the crisis with the aid of dialogue between all Algerians. The situation remains difficult and complex, however, as may be seen from the low turnout at the parliamentary election on 30 May 2002. The October local elections will also be able to provide an important indication of the situation in the region. Improvement at the socio-economic level would aid the search for a solution, and we have every desire to help with the efforts aimed at economic reforms. We are supporting these by means of the Meda Regulation, providing EUR 240 million for the period 2000-2004, and by means of the loans from the European Investment Bank, amounting to EUR 620 million since 1996. Once it has been put in place, the new investment facility should also contribute to improving the economic situation in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the association agreement, the Association Council can facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and Algeria’s parliamentary institutions, as well as between the Economic and Social Committee and the corresponding body in Algeria. I should like to emphasise that the Council takes a positive view of the conclusions of the latest meeting of the parliamentary Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, emphasising the parliamentary dimension of our partnership with the southern Mediterranean countries. We are in the process of looking into which cooperation mechanisms can be used for setting up such a Euro-Mediterranean assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to comment on three important points, in reply to the issues raised by Mr Brok. The first relates to the economic and political reforms which this agreement may help, the second relates to people's freedom of movement and the third relates to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, from a political point of view, Algeria decided in 1989 to adopt a constitution allowing a multi-party system. At present, democracy is not very well grounded, with political life segregated from civil society. Algeria has a duty to improve the situation and, more to the point, to ensure that there is a genuine division between the executive, legislative and judicial powers and transparent ballot counts. The political dialogue for which provision is made in the association agreement will provide a valuable framework for exchanging opinions and experience on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view, the association agreement allows for the gradual introduction of a single free trade area between Algeria and the European Union and challenges the Algerian Government to make the necessary reforms. As stressed in the resolution, it will have to start by satisfying certain basic needs of the people, such as running water, housing and medical care, otherwise it will clearly be unable to push ahead with other reforms because it will not have the consent of the people. Similarly, it needs to move and facilitate the move from the present planned economy to a free-market economy. This reform was overdue in Algeria anyway, because the suffocating planned economy had reached its limits. But now it has an opportunity, helped by this agreement, to adopt economic reforms which, basically, will rectify economic distortions and social inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The transition to a free-market economy will require consultations with business associations, with the trades union, and will need to focus on improving the legal framework for business and investment activities, reforming the banking system and stamping out corruption. The government recently approved a 7 billion dollar programme along these lines, which covers a great many of these issues. Again, the aid provided by the European Union under the MEDA programme will supplement this programme, given its three basic objectives of: one, strengthening the market economy; two, developing human resources, and three, consolidating the rule of law and satisfying certain requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the free movement of persons. Under the agreement, the European Union is charged with finding ways of simplifying the visa procedure, as Mr Frederiksen mentioned, especially for the people involved in implementing it. This is a reasonable request on the Algerian side. The association agreement cannot concern itself merely with the setting up of a free trade zone; it must also make it easier for people to travel in both directions. I should point out that this endeavour relates to legal movements and in no way contradicts the Seville conclusions on stopping illegal immigration. The agreement signed is completely in line with the Seville guidelines making provision for specific collaboration on illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the human rights clause, which is fundamental to the association procedure. The Commission acknowledges that Algeria has experienced tragic terrorist activity over the past ten years and we are giving the Algerian Government all the support we can in its fight against terrorism; but we also believe that the fight against terrorism is no excuse whatsoever for trampling over fundamental freedoms. The link to the Barcelona process implies a joint commitment to comply with certain basic democratic rules and values. Our main concern in this area is for those whose whereabouts are unknown; there are serious obstacles which need to be overcome both by their families and by non-governmental organisations, who frequently encounter delaying tactics on the part of the authorities. I think that the application of the human rights clause can be dealt with both adjectivally and substantially. Adjectivally through political dialogue, which needs to be predicated on human rights, and substantially, I would say, by the European Union by using a clearer and more substantive language with fewer evasions. One item on the agenda for political dialogue is the question of Kabylie. We are hoping to inaugurate a dialogue with representative agencies and we welcome the conciliatory approach taken recently on the question of the official recognition of Tamazight as a national language.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is willing, as it has already stated, to foster dialogue with the Algerian parliament and this will be vital to exchanges of information, common positions and the interests of both sides. Contrary to what is stated in the motion for a resolution, the importance of this is clearly stated in Article 99 of the agreement and the Commission will do its utmost to facilitate this sort of dialogue. On a more general note, the Commission wholeheartedly supports Parliament's approval of this association agreement, which must not under any circumstances be seen as a blank cheque for the Algerian Government; it is a way of encouraging it to continue with the political, economic and social reforms it has started, basically in order to better the lot of the Algerian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morillon (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when giving our opinion, according to the recommendations of Mr Obiols, with regard to the proposal for an association agreement with the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, through the intermediary of its Chairman, Mr Brok, and with the agreement of its bureau, considered it necessary to open the debate that has brought us here today and which will be followed, tomorrow, by the adoption of a resolution that I hope will be voted for by a very large majority of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This step, which, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, has just enabled us to obtain the answers we were waiting for in response to our main questions, must in no way be interpreted as an attempt to interfere in Algeria’s domestic affairs, particularly as a mark of disrespect towards Algerian culture and identity. On the contrary, it falls within the scope of Parliament’s commitment, recalled here by Mr Obiols, to establishing a privileged partnership with the Maghreb countries based on mutual respect and increased awareness of our common destiny. That was the aim of the own-initiative report on the Arab Maghreb Union, for which Mr Cohn-Bendit and I were co-rapporteurs, which was adopted by a very large majority in this House before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this debate, I would now like to emphasise three points that have already been partially raised. The first is that timetabling clashes mean we are delivering our opinion on the same day that local elections, which are crucial for the future, are taking place in Algeria as you mentioned, President-in-Office of the Council. We must hope that these elections contribute to achieving peace, and do not, as some fear today, particularly in Kabylia, give rise to further outbreaks of violence which would serve as pretexts for further repression.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that, among the anticipated consequences of the conclusion of this agreement, we firmly hope that aid from the European Union will provide a solution to one of the main difficulties in this country, namely the problem of youth unemployment and the resulting frustrations. In this regard, President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the need to increase investment and you invited Europeans to invest. In fact, we believe that this is one of the very important areas in which the agreement should allow us to demonstrate our commitment. Today, however, we draw the attention of the Algerian authorities to the fact that, for European investors, the formalities that must currently be fulfilled with a view to approval are probably a little too bureaucratic and can sometimes be discouraging. I have already said this to our Algerian counterparts when I met them last week, but I would like to repeat it today.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we must hope this agreement will help to develop and strengthen regional cooperation – and you mentioned that as well, President-in-Office of the Council – and that it will therefore contribute to kick-starting the process of constituting the Arab Maghreb Union, a process which today is unfortunately at a standstill in the absence of any prospect of a political solution to the problem of the Western Sahara. Also on this point, I believe it would be useful to ask the Algerian authorities to pay the utmost attention to finding a solution that allows all the parties concerned to save face, by means, naturally, of the necessary compromises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it should make us more committed to making a clear assessment of the current state of the country and to helping the Algerian people to overcome their difficulties. That is why I am giving my full support to the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement that has been presented to us for our agreement today. I believe it is along the right lines for four main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">This is part of the very rationale behind the process opened in Barcelona, encouraging Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. This agreement will facilitate regional integration and in particular the Arab Maghreb Union, which we are hoping for with all our might. This agreement sends a strong signal of the solidarity of European citizens with the Algerian people. And in particular, this agreement should support Algeria in its efforts to achieve openness, reforms and modernisation. That is the most important thing. In this context, I am pleased to see the broad consensus within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in favour of the proposed measures. Nevertheless, our agreement must not be interpreted as giving the Algerian authorities carte blanche. We must remain vigilant on the subject of human rights, democracy and good governance. These fundamental values are the very cornerstone of the European Union and must be respected as a prerequisite for the correct implementation of the agreement. That is why Parliament’s motion for a resolution, which recalls these requirements, is along the right lines and should be given the utmost consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to add that, as a Frenchwoman, I am particularly aware of the difficulties that the Algerian people has suffered for so long. The suffering of this country has gone on long enough. We all need to take urgent action to find concrete solutions. The association agreement will contribute to this if we are able to give objective consideration to Algeria’s real problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of us have also had bilateral contact with a number of representatives of Algeria. We have done all of this not only because we take this issue seriously, but also because there are many issues concerning Algeria which need to be dealt with. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is particularly concerned about the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that serious human rights violations are being committed in Algeria. Torture and persecution of opponents are unfortunately not unusual, and there are many reports of abuses by military and paramilitary groups. Thousands of citizens have disappeared, and it is worrying that the Algerian authorities have not permitted UN observers to investigate this situation. The situation in Kabylia is still desperate, and peaceful demonstrators have been killed. Much remains to be done in Algeria in the domains of freedom of the press, freedom of association and the establishment of the rule of law. The country also has a terrorism problem.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues are described very well and in great detail in Mr Brok’s resolution. It also points out the need for a regular follow-up of the way in which human rights are being observed, for scrutiny and for interparliamentary dialogue. The Liberal Group has made constructive efforts to contribute to this resolution. It is therefore with some surprise and disappointment that we note that the Christian Democrats have put forward a number of amendments which considerably dilute the resolution. If these amendments are adopted, we believe that the resolution will not have the required force or constitute the complement to the recommendation by Mr Obiols i Germà that is so important. The Liberal Group would vote against the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a shame if these points disappeared, because it is very important to put pressure on the Algerian Government. The association agreement is important for Algeria. In spite of the agreement’s shortcomings, we believe that Europe has to help Algeria to build up its economic, political and democratic institutions. As has been pointed out, the agreement constitutes an extremely important part of the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, by way of conclusion I wish to address a few words to the Commission. What is the significance of Article 2 of the association agreement: the human rights clause? We have discussed it many, many times, but it has never been acted upon. What is so terribly difficult about finding mechanisms for temporarily or, if necessary, permanently breaking off cooperation, with reference to Article 2, when serious human rights violations are carried out? If we do not lead from the front on this issue, we will actually make ourselves look ridiculous, and we risk not being taken seriously in the field of foreign policy. If so, all our talk of a human rights dimension in foreign policy will be nothing but resoundingly empty words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Algerians are practically alone in having suffered the barbarity of fundamentalist terrorism since before 11 September 2001. The European Union, for its part, must strengthen its links with the southern Mediterranean basin by freeing itself from its ideas of domination. This would be one way of countering the unilateralism of an American superpower that is more and more interested in Algeria and the wealth that lies beneath it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the association agreement shows the will to establish privileged links between the Union and Algeria, it also raises questions, starting with the lack of prior consultation, as denounced by Algerian independent trade unions and associations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution rightly emphasises human rights first and foremost, and the resolution must keep this aspect. Like others, I in turn would like to express my concern over the situation in Kabylia, where tomorrow’s local elections are already marked by calls for a boycott, for strikes and for the police to take control. Why has no credible solution for overcoming this crisis been put forward by the Algerian Government? Why have no legal proceedings commenced against those responsible for the oppression perpetrated in what has become known as the ‘black spring of 2001’? When will lawsuits cease against representatives of the citizens’ movement? Most of all, are these not signs of a deep malaise within Algerian society as a whole, but in particular among young people?</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing number of lawsuits against journalists and the persistent refusal to repeal the family code, problems over which, to my great surprise, some Members wish to draw a veil in the resolution, can only stir up despair and tension. The future of Algeria, however, would be more secure under the existing potential for democracy than under a new resurgence of fundamentalist ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is important to take account of urgent social issues. There is a tremendous need in terms of employment, housing, public infrastructures for health, education and water, while inequality and foreign reserves have never been so high. Unlike the rationale for free trade, which encourages liberalisation and deregulation, this situation, on the contrary, requires a true cooperation measure, for example in the field of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe therefore has a responsibility. Will the serious concerns of many players in the Algerian economy over the establishment of a free trade area be heard? What will our assessment be of the economic, social and environmental consequences?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to call for vigilance with regard to respect for the free movement of persons and equality of economic, social and political rights for Algerian nationals on European soil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, it is what it is. Our support, however, for the challenge of forging lasting political relations between both sides of the Mediterranean is unstinting, and we also hope that the Algerian crisis can emerge from behind closed doors where it has tragically played out for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore like to take up the challenge of shared development. Mr Morillon, I am going to put your mind at ease, please be reassured: we are not interfering when we talk of the democratic deficit and of the importance of supporting the development of freedom in this country. The report of the Arab States office of the United Nations Development Programme says this itself. It is therefore not a matter of interference at all. Democracy is the foundation of development in all its forms. However, in order to meet this challenge, in order<span class="bold"> </span>to take up this challenge of shared development, we must begin by not adding confusion to the chaos in Algeria. Certainly, this agreement must not give the authorities free rein. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to very clearly acknowledge that, today, it is practically indecent to deny that the violence that has blighted Algeria for more than ten years is down to groups of all kinds, and when I say all kinds, clearly I am also talking about military security groups. This has to be said! Paramilitary groups. This has to be written!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Habib Souaidia, who is present here today along with other friends whom I would like to greet, was accused of slander by General Nezzar. Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all. The case brought by Mr Nezzar was thrown out. Will we have just the merest fraction of the courage of this Algerian lieutenant? I believe that we should start by acknowledging in our resolution the suffering and tragedy, the hundreds of thousands who have died and the thousands who have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our resolution must clearly call for the lifting of the state of emergency which is a real denial of freedom, and the public authorities with whom we negotiate, by declaring this state of emergency, have even let their prerogatives lapse, under the guise of military power. How can we accept this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A foreign, imperialist attack that, as elsewhere, used Islamic extremism for geopolitical ends, which we have been too short-sighted to see. Mrs Boumediene-Thiery brought up the main issue a moment ago when she reminded us of the United States’ desire to get its hands on Algeria’s mineral resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Algerian Government passed the test victorious in spite of its isolation and timidity, I would even say faintheartedness, for which European aid is chiefly to blame. In order for this association to be successful, it must not be limited to good intentions, or just to vague, exclusively economic, free trade agreements. It must also be a political association. In other words, we must get used to addressing all global political issues together with our Mediterranean partners. Furthermore, this is a prerequisite for the Mediterranean to remain at the centre of the world stage; unless this condition is met, we might become more African, Mediterranean or European, but have only a minor role to play in the twenty-first century world.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, we must clearly go beyond a simple association agreement with Algeria, as with other Maghreb countries, which are our closest allies. We need to alter the structure of Europe and leave behind any fantasies of supranationality and federalism so that we can include our Mediterranean neighbours in an expanded European Union, which will clearly make imperial powers see that they are up against a group of countries devoted to the preservation of liberty, that is to say …</p>

<p class="contents">This being so, may I say how delighted I am that the agreement clearly refers to respect for fundamental human rights. I am also delighted at the references to promoting the role of women in economic and social development through education, vocational training, better family planning programmes and the media. What saddens me, however, is that these references alone will not promote respect for women's rights in practice and that no reference to this issue was made either by the President-in-Office or by you, Commissioner, who are a champion of women's rights and have nailed your flag to the mast of respect for the principle of equality in the Community's foreign relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that, in its resolution on the report on respect for women's rights in Euro-Mediterranean relations, the European Parliament called for an express provision on protection for women's rights and, at the same time, called for provision to be made for a protection monitoring policy similar to that applied to candidate countries. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to voice my disappointment, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, at the sidelining of this issue and to salute the Commissioner's words, her optimistic words, about the association agreement not being a blank cheque for Algeria. We would like the European Commission to set up mechanisms to monitor and evaluate progress and for the Algerian Government to be required, as should happen with all association agreements, to demonstrate the necessary political will to bring about the legislative, administrative and other reforms needed in order to anchor equal opportunities between men and women in the law and include gender mainstreaming in all its policies. In the same vein, we want to support Mr Brok's proposal on combating and condemning violence against women and, as condemnation never suffices, we want to impose a strategy inspired by the experience and successes of strategies in the European Union and the candidate countries to combat violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same vein, I should like to condemn the absence of the role of women and women's organisations from the proposed regional collaboration. This, at the very least, is one area where provision should be made to strengthen civil society and work with women's organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has experienced, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, a period of relative isolation in terms of international relations, particularly relations with Europe, not least in that there is a connection between Algeria and the African dimension and it is important that this aspect of relations is strengthened too. I would like to place this report precisely in the context of the partnership. The agreement is actually an instrument, it is not a concession granted by Europe, by the European Union, to Algeria, for we too benefit from the agreement – we must never forget that – and it is an instrument which unites, an instrument based on a vision of partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean? It means that we need to exploit all the possibilities, both as regards Algerian society – which we could say may be stifling both its economic potential and its human resources potential – and as regards ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to a number of points. You set great store by the Agadir process set up between the countries which have concluded association agreements with us. You ought to focus equally on the Maghreb dimension of the partnership, for, as we all know, the borders are closed between Morocco and Algeria, and if Europe does not help to increase cooperation between neighbours I do not know what its mission is.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I feel that it is important to place the emphasis on human rights – as other Members have done – and on the elections. I would like to say to the Algerian authorities that something important is happening in Kabylia: a party which did not take part in the political elections has presented itself at the administrative elections. This is important because it repairs a deep institutional divide which had become established. We have witnessed a period when, for example, relations between the police and the people of Kabylia were non-existent. It would be a shame if, during the elections, the police authorities were to create problems once again rather than protecting the people and assuring the smooth running of the electoral process, which is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore absurd to make a comparison between Algeria and the candidate countries, for we are not granting Algeria accession to the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, let us be quite clear about that. The greater the consideration that the Union gives to these countries, the greater the benefits it might derive from relations too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to say to my good friend Philippe Morillon, ‘Philippe, you are wrong. All your amendments are misguided. And I believe that you should think about them tonight and withdraw these amendments as soon as you wake up tomorrow. Most of them have already been withdrawn? Well then, withdraw the rest! We will all be happy!’ Why?</p>
<p class="contents">Because it is obvious that we must exercise our right to intervene. The Algerians exercise this right to interfere in our affairs when they say that our immigration policy is not right, that they do not have enough visas, etc. They have the right to participate in European discussions. If there is an association agreement, then we have not only the right but also the duty to intervene when massacres are committed. We must condemn massacres, whether they are committed by Islamic terrorists, paramilitary terrorists or other terrorists linked to some armed service. We do not have the right to allow the Algerian embassy to dictate resolutions or amendments to us. That is not our role.</p>
<p class="contents">Here our role is to establish an association agreement, on the one hand, and on the other, to intervene politically in discussions in Algeria, so that Algeria can emerge as a democracy. And this is not just the fault of colonialism, though colonialism does have its faults. Algeria has a single party tradition. Algeria has a tradition of military power where the military stands above society and it is the military that commits both good and evil acts. This has to change and it is exactly what we are trying to say in the resolution tabled by your colleague Mr Brok, and which many Members voted for. And I ask that tomorrow we change nothing in this resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which is not a resolution of the left, but a resolution by Mr Brok, a member of the PPE-DE. Let us adopt this resolution. Let us vote for it as it stands and we will all be happy.</p>
