I am delighted that so many MEPs are attending today’s debate on an issue of such importance. I understand that a large number of British MEPs had a meeting in the bar and discussed how they could prevent me from speaking. That plan did not work. But I would like to take this opportunity also to thank my Spanish fellow MEPs: I cannot fault their behaviour which is entirely in tune with the Rules of Procedure, for although we do not see eye to eye in terms of content, they still made the effort to be here. All credit to the Spanish. As for my British counterparts, I can no longer show them any respect because they surreptitiously tried to cancel all debates this evening within my own group.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have been working on this directive since as early as the autumn of 1998. On the basis of that directive, we will adapt the rules on emissions of pollutants from large combustion plants. Despite all opposition on the part of a number of Member States and despite all warnings and protests from some interested parties in the electricity sector, my instinct tells me that we can amend the original regulation without any problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical facilities are already widely available and, in a large number of the EU Member States, the modified rules are already prescribed and are hence normal policy. The environmental requirements which, in a number of countries are prescribed for large furnaces, are invariably stricter because the acidification of our environment is still ongoing. Add to that the issue of ozone – you will be aware of the fact that many citizens suffer from respiratory disorders, which are partly caused by nitrogen oxides originating from traffic and the sector at issue today – then surely it should be more or less a point of honour for everyone in this House to address these problems when it is possible to do so in a simple and effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Commission proposal to amend the 1998 directive was not what you would call a runaway success: standardisation was poor and existing installations were kept outside the range of the directive. Parliament showed its best side at first reading and did what parliaments are expected to do, namely to lend substance to the care for humans, nature and the environment in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s common position came about with the greatest difficulty. Moreover, the European Parliament’s wish to include existing installations in the directive was also taken into consideration, and legislation was tightened up to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The snag – and my fellow Spanish MEPs regret this – was that each country managed to negotiate their own exceptions, and if it was up to the Court of Ministers, we would be using old and polluting power stations not updated with state-of-the-art technology <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>. The common position lacked any vision whatsoever; it was a pick-and-mix with something for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside environmental arguments, I have also supplied evidence for the need to tighten the common position: in addition to the need to protect public health (ozone smog), I also came up with a few economic alternatives, for it is true that we would like to develop an environment industry in Europe. If we compare the Council’s emission requirements with the regulations which currently apply in the United States or Japan, we come off rather badly.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people claim that there is no need for requirements with regard to combustion plants, for, thanks to Mrs Myller’s report, we are being given emission ceilings anyway. If we meet the expectations of those in favour of liberalising the energy market, in other words if we do not prescribe requirements, or if we allow exceptions, with regard to generating electricity using old, polluting power stations, the market mechanism will be disturbed, and those who neglect the environment will be rewarded with a headstart thanks to their cheap energy prices. That cannot be the intention of European environmental legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the European Union has finally overcome its reluctance to introduce European rules on combustion plants. The importance of these European rules lies very simply in the fact that we have a liberalised electricity market in the European Community, and it goes without saying that, in this liberalised market, standards for atmospheric pollution and the like should be comparable throughout Europe. The Commission has therefore reacted properly by focusing primarily on the old plants, for which there have regrettably been no rules since 1987 and which, to put it bluntly, have caused quite heavy pollution throughout Europe. I fully support the Commission’s activity in this area. I warmly welcome it, and I believe it represents a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there is room for argument about whether particular exceptional arrangements can be extended for a year or two in the case of small power plants. That would not have posed us any problems in our quest for a compromise. The great pity is that we have not arrived at such a compromise. The approach is right. And anyone who thinks – and I wish to say this in spite of all the anger that has been voiced here – that environmental policies are a national responsibility is quite wrong, because most of the pollution emitted by these power stations ends up in the territory of our partners in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. I believe we are jointly and severally bound to find an answer. I believe we have found that answer and that we have also found ways of ensuring that special arrangements can be made for small plants for the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the rapporteur has presented a good report. We should continue along this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will affect our air quality, our water quality, the general quality of our environment throughout the whole of Europe and beyond in the coming years if we bring it to fruition. That is, of course, if the Member States have the will to do so. The proposal has now reached its second reading. We have insisted very strongly at first reading that the most stringent measures are taken to control gaseous emissions from large combustion plants throughout the Union because of the acid gases that are formed, because of the effects upon the environment, and because of the effects upon human health.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached the point where we have in front of us the common position. I understand the Council has worked very hard to achieve this and it does propose new and better levels of emissions. However, my group thinks that things can go further. My group thinks that in combination with a number of other factors, Mrs Myller's report which is to follow for example, it is possible to put a little more into this proposal than we see already. In that respect, I would commend to you the amendments, particularly those that apply to the articles and the annex which control the emission limit values from the large combustion plants.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that we are confronted with a very difficult choice tonight because we must decide if what we vote tonight is at least in some way acceptable to the Council. The Council has indicated that it is unwilling to accept further amendments from Parliament. If we achieve the appropriate votes tomorrow, that unwillingness becomes an obligation and the Council will have to sit down and negotiate with Parliament. That cannot be a bad thing in terms of the recognition of the ability of this Parliament to achieve a high level of environmental protection for the people of Europe. It seems to me that what we can do tomorrow in the vote is to take a few more steps forward to achieve a little bit more in terms of benefit to the environment. That has to be balanced against the possible consequences for the energy strategies and the energy industries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very mindful of that. If you look tonight at the amendments which the Socialists will be supporting, we have relatively long timescales for these new regulations to be incorporated into EU law. We must take this step forward, but inevitably we must also allow for the fact that this step needs to be accommodated not just by the environment but economically as well.</p>

The report on large combustion plants, take two, is also an important report. It concerns acidification, traditional air pollution and ozone smog. Acidification was a buzz word in the 80s. That is when it all started. Many citizens believe that the problem of acidification has now been resolved, but that is not the case. We have a long way to go yet.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the energy market has been liberalised. That means that it is becoming more difficult to uphold environmental rules. For example, in my own country, the Netherlands, a Belgian company is buying up Dutch gas plants and is replacing them with coal plants, which are many times more polluting and also bad in terms of CO2-emission.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need environmental rules, and strict ones at that. The Environmental Committee has fortunately supported these, but the Environmental Committee’s amendments will, unfortunately, not make it: they are unlikely to attract 314 votes. But the Green Group would like to know who will then be responsible for this. The Green Group will be supporting the Christian-Democratic amendments, albeit with an aching heart. These are weaker because they leave ammonia out of the equation for no good reason. That is an unnecessary concession to the farmers who constitute their grassroots support. Despite this, we will be supporting those amendments, for the Greens, too, have now grown up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the measures proposed in the common position are one-sided. Basically, it proposes to abolish lignite and coal as energy sources, ostensibly to protect the environment, but it ignores or is silent on the subject of other major sources of pollution, such as cars. At the same time, it ignores the fact that 70% of new power stations in the United States and 50% in Japan use solid fuels, such as coal, because production is cheaper, even if initial investments are more costly. We would also point out that, if lignite and coal are abolished, a large number of power stations will close and the numbers of unemployed, which are already high, will swell still further, whereas we could be discussing additional measures to prevent pollution, such as filters, green belts etc. Perhaps this one-sidedness at the expense of solid fuels comes from a willingness and an intention to promote natural gas, which serves certain interests in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In Greece, we use lignite as a basic and financially satisfactory source of energy. At the same time, we are pressing for as many protective measures as it is possible to take. If, as the experts say, natural gas reserves will run out in a hundred years and solid fuel reserves will run out in two hundred and fifty years, we should be discussing how to make the best possible use of all these sources of energy, not abolishing some of them, especially at a time when the energy question is paramount and affects the cost of living of our workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, all large combustion plants together account for 63% of the sulphur dioxide and 21% of the nitrogen oxide emissions in the European Union. There are therefore major environmental gains to be had in this sector. Rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten has made sound proposals to this effect. The Council has reviewed the directive in its entirety, but there is sufficient reason for making a number of further adjustments at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the emission limit values must be brought into line with the current scope of technology. If we realise that waste incineration plants and cement kilns are only allowed to emit 40 mg of sulphur dioxide, I am surprised at the values for combustion plants which can be as high as 2 000 mg. I can just about understand why the rules for large combustion plants are more relaxed, but forty times more relaxed is unacceptable to me. As the state-of-the-art technology stands at present, it is altogether possible to reduce the level of SO2-emission down to 100.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the values proposed by the Environmental Committee, which vary from 1 200 to 300 for existing plants, are definitely not too strict. Strict standards can be prescribed for new plants since the new technology can be used here. The amendments which we have tabled in tandem with the Green Group include limit values of 400 for small plants and 200 for large plants.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the bizarre exemption provisions must be deleted. The fact that large, old combustion plants are allowed to pollute 2 200 hours annually is unacceptable, as is the fact that it is permitted to exceed the emission limit values if the fuel, such as highly polluting brown coal, is extracted from the country’s own soil. In my opinion, the exceptions for Spain and the islands of Crete and Rhodes are also unacceptable. The liberalisation of the energy market should bring with it equal environmental conditions. We therefore need to abandon the aforesaid exceptions in order to avoid distortion of competition. In addition, incentives must be given to rejuvenate or renew old and heavily polluting plants, instead of allowing the serious pollution of the atmosphere to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the offshore gas turbines must also meet emission requirements. Because of the changing composition of fuel, I am aware that it is impossible to meet the strict emission requirements at certain times. But if offshore gas turbines are written off completely because of it, any incentive for improvement is taken away. The amendment I tabled contains very flexible emission limit values by way of alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns the approximation of this directive to the waste incineration directive. In the event of different fuels being mixed, the ultimate emission limit value in both directives is calculated in a different way. It makes little difference to the result but, in practice, the combination of these two calculation methods is not only very complicated but also unnecessary. I have proposed an adaptation in Amendment No 43. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I also want to emphasise my disappointment at the fact that Members of this Parliament, and above all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, are unable to accept the democratic process embarked upon three years ago and now to be brought to a conclusion, but are, at the last minute, trying to thwart this document.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, even if I have not always understood the path she has chosen, the course she has subsequently charted and why the end result appears not to reflect the original, higher ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that our use of fossil fuels is not a sustainable use of energy. That is something we are really all agreed on. We have known about the problem for at least 30 years, and it is now time to do something about it. I have said it before and I shall say it again: Parliament supported a strategy on acidifying air pollution three years ago. Now it is time to put this strategy into effect. That is what this directive is about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only about acidifying air pollution in Sweden, Norway or Denmark. It is about half a million people who, in different places on this earth of ours, die each year because of the use of fossil fuels. It is about all those who contract chronic illnesses, for example chronic bronchitis, because of the burning of fossil fuels. It is not only, therefore, a question of tightening up limit values but, to just as great an extent, a matter of our people’s health. That is something which Members must not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in actual fact possible to retain a good level of service in the energy field and, at the same time, to work towards a better environment. We are on the right road. It is we who have the opportunity to set the pace if 314 Members have the courage to take up a definite position tomorrow in favour of the more ambitious alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is scarcely surprising that the Council should have submitted a compromise in the form of a text which is a watered down version of that which Parliament approved at first reading and would have liked to have seen. It is also obvious that, at second reading, we should again put forward the same demands in order to put pressure on the Council and obtain a good negotiating position for ourselves in the inevitable conciliation, for we know that we must act now if we are to get to see any results at all within the foreseeable future. We must dare to set strict limit values for all types of plant, both old and new, large and small.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s limit values are not as far-reaching. The Council appears to have lost faith in our ability to develop new technology at all. It is absolutely crucial that old plants which already exist should be covered by this directive and that they should also be subject to strict limit values. Nothing would be as intended if too many exceptions were granted. Nothing would remain of the high ambitions entertained. Small plants too must, therefore, be covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out that the directive establishes a framework for that liberalisation of the energy market we are seeing today. Without such a framework, there would be total anarchy in the European energy market. Minimum environmental requirements are needed in order to create common ground rules. Those requirements we are now imposing upon ourselves in the European Union are also demands which must apply to the Union’s future members. Today and tomorrow, we have the opportunity not only to put a stop to dangerous emissions but also to improve public health and prepare the ground for a successful future enlargement of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At half-time millions of kettles are turned on to make a cup of tea – for those who have not been drinking beer since the start of the match at least. The demand for electricity – a commodity that cannot be stored – peaks. To meet this demand, or at similar times such as particularly cold days in winter, some of our older coal-fired power stations are pressed into service. Amendments to the common position threaten the future of some of these stations and the jobs of the miners who supply the coal. It is technically possible to upgrade them, but in many cases it would be cheaper to build new gas plants and retro-fit these stations with exhaust scrubbers.</p>
<p class="contents">The main plank of our air quality strategy in this area is the national emission ceilings and, as long as they are met, Member States should have a degree of flexibility. New gas-fired plants have already contributed to the UK meeting its targets. How a Member State meets its obligations is an issue of subsidiarity. Some of the proposed amendments will be counterproductive. For example, the inclusion of an end date of 2012 will result in old plants being run harder to use up the time remaining and will increase pollution during those four years.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is already a compromise and takes account of first reading amendments by adding in measures on existing plants which were not part of the Commission proposal. We should not destabilise the delicate compromise package by seeking to further amend this directive, which already delivers substantial and very real environmental improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up-to-date limit values for large power plants are needed both in the Member States and the candidate countries. For that reason, we must thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, sincerely for her hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee is imposing substantially stricter limits with no adequate differentiation being made with regard to their size and type. The one-off investments in new technology the directive calls for are the same irrespective of the size of the plant. This would particularly threaten the ecologically recognised combined production of heat and power. In my own country, for example, this might mean a step backwards in ecological terms. In Finland many different bodies share this concern, among others the Ministry of the Environment. The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would mean investments that were not cost-effective in terms of ecological benefit, and difficulties for the combined use of energy-efficient wood and peat and the combined production of power and heat. The latter process is carried out mainly in medium-size plants, which would now be treated in the same way as the large ones.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the use of peat is justified. It promotes the added use of wood in power plants, as combined combustion improves the way the combustion process can be controlled, reduces problems of corrosion, and adds to the reliability of fuel being available. The report does not support this objective either, one which is directly linked to the matter of bio-fuels. It might even be said that the report could be accused of environmental avarice in some of the amendments and that it is therefore in danger of stifling many important environmental objectives. However, it is important that the report should be adopted and the directive be brought into effect, as it will prevent emissions from drifting long distances and acid deposits affecting the natural environment of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">With its amendments, in search of compromise as they are, my own group is trying, among other things, to ensure that the combined production of heat and power in small and medium-sized power plants can continue, while the large plants are compelled to invest in technology that can adhere to stricter limit values. In addition, the compromises seek to ensure that burning peat, which contains very little sulphur, does not require needless extra investment, as opposed to processes using fuels with a higher sulphur content. This is contained in Amendment No 36. We appreciate it very much that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has agreed to these compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves once again in a situation where a legislator has to face the fact that different environmental conditions also mean different environmental effects. Unless we can find the right solutions to these problems, our last resort may have to be to have our own directive for fuels within the context of the northern dimension, although this would not be a very good solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must question further tightening beyond the common position and whether it will bring any significant additional environmental benefits. The common position was developed in tandem with the proposed NEC directive and represents a coherent and balanced approach to achieving environmental objectives over time. The proposed amendments are not justified in terms of environmental benefits and associated costs and other impacts and would disturb the balance achieved. Further tightening would increase costs and reduce Member State flexibility in meeting agreed national targets and accelerate increased dependence on natural gas with attendant fuel security concerns for electricity generation, particularly in countries like Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Additional restrictions on existing LCP are not justified in the context of Member State commitments under the NEC directive to reduce overall emissions and the impending application of the IPPC directive. Some amendments will even have a perverse effect. For example, stringent and uneconomic ELVs for small plants will hinder combined heat and power development and others do not support an integrated approach to the environment. Proposals to tighten ELVs are not proportionate regarding costs and benefits and fail to recognise that the common position is a balance between improving environmental performance and avoiding excessive costs and other impacts. No cost-benefit analysis is provided for the further reduction of emissions from plants with already low emission concentrations.</p>
<p class="contents">One amendment I have difficulty with is the proposal to reduce NOx emission limits from 650 to 200. It is technically feasible but will require the installation of costly end-of-pipe controls. This will require more energy input and result in increased CO2 emissions, the use of more raw materials and the production of hazardous waste. The Council's proposed ELVs could be met by primary means at a much lower cost. As noted previously, these additional costs will ultimately be borne in high electricity prices. However, it is not at all clear that the benefits in additional NOx emission reductions outweigh the associated environmental and economic costs, i.e. this is not consistent with an integrated approach to the environment as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our ecosystem continues to suffer from acidification and eutrophification. It is an issue where Europe can and must act since air pollution knows no borders and this directive will make an important contribution to reducing atmospheric pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the key issues under discussion. The question of existing plants has been the major point in the debate on this proposal, both at first reading in the Council and now at second reading. After a very difficult discussion in the Council, the common position was achieved with unanimity. It now includes significant new and tougher requirements for these plants and this will result in considerably reduced emissions of sulphur dioxide from the large combustion plant sector of the existing Member States and ultimately in an enlarged Community.</p>
<p class="contents">While I consider that it is necessary to keep a degree of flexibility in the approach to existing plants, I share Parliament's view that a final date should be established, after which the obligations for everyone will be clear. Parliament has played a very important role in pointing towards the outcome on existing plants, and I am grateful to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her efforts as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has proposed a number of amendments to make the emission limit values more stringent, both in the case of existing plants and plants that will be licensed after the new directive comes into force. Already the common position will reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide from the LCP sector considerably. Therefore I see little justification at this point to further tighten emission limit values for sulphur dioxide for existing plants.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the case of nitrogen oxides the effect will be less significant as the standards that apply to existing plants are not very demanding. Hence there is some merit in tightening emission limit values for nitrogen oxides. In the case of new plants, economies of scale which reduce the cost of compliance allow for further tightening of emission limit values for both nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of indigenous fuels, the time has come to remove the divergent treatment of indigenous solid fuels and other fuels and the process of phasing-out should now begin, especially in view of the changing commercial nature of the large combustion sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 7, 8 in part; 9, 12, 13, second part; 14, 16, 17 for plants over 300 MW; 18 and 19, both for plants between 100 and 300 MW; 21, 28 and 29, both in part; 39 and 40. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 13, first part, 15, 24, 25, 26, 30 to 38, 43, 44, 49, 50 and 51.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a short comment on the other proposed amendments. Let me assure you that the Commission has considered carefully all the 50 amendments tabled. Overall we can accept 23, either fully, in part or in principle. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which will simplify the obligations for refineries, and Amendment No 23 in principle, subject to ensuring that its implementation is compatible with other legislative requirements on access to this type of information on emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept in principle Amendment No 1, dealing with economic instruments; Amendment No 2, concerning the alignment of the definition of biomass with the recently adopted directive on the incineration of waste, and parts of Amendment No 5 requiring further examination of emissions of heavy metals from the LCP sector and emissions from large combustion plants in the maritime sector. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 22 and 27 as they would detract from the common position or introduce inconsistencies with recently adopted and related legislation on waste incineration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is preferable to await the outcome of the review in 2004 before including gas turbines in offshore applications. We have not yet assessed all the technical implications but that will be done in the review in 2004. Thus Amendments Nos 42, 45, 46, 47 and 48 are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that in both readings Parliament contributed to improving this legislative proposal. This will have an impact not only in the present European Union but ultimately also in an enlarged Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
