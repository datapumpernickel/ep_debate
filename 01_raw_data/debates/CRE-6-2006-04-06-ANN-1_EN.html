<p>(DE)Secure high-speed broadband networks are vitally important to the Commission’s ‘i2010’ strategy for boosting growth and jobs in the digital economy. Provision of broadband services acts as a catalyst for the realisation of the following goals of the i2010 strategy: (i) completion of a single European information area promoting an open and competitive internal market for the information society and media, and (ii) achieving an inclusive European information society that promotes growth and jobs in a manner that is consistent with sustainable development and prioritises better public services and quality of life. Bridging the digital divide in the area of broadband, in other words ensuring widespread availability and use of broadband services, calls for diverse, mutually agreed and coherent measures at different levels of administration.</p>
<p>All of the national reform programmes (NRPs) submitted by the Member States to the Commission following the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy last year deal with the subject of broadband provision and expansion, with competition viewed as the most important driving force for the development of broadband technologies. In less-developed areas of the Union, on the other hand, public funding is helping to accelerate the introduction of broadband. Many of the NRPs put forward extensive broadband programmes (AT, IE, EE, FI, FR, HU, IT, LU, LT, PT, SI, ES), and the topic of broadband connections for SMEs is dealt with in the broadband strategies of the Member States, of the Commission and of the Council.</p>
<p>As the Council emphasised in its conclusions of 1 December 2005, the i2010 strategy is a shared responsibility between Member States, the European institutions and stakeholders. That being the case, the Council invited the Commission, among other things, to ‘review the impact of digital convergence on the creation, circulation and distribution of European content, and if appropriate, bring forward proposals to promote a rich and diverse digital content market, increased use of broadband and the development of Next Generation Networks (NGNs)’, and to ‘prepare a European initiative on e-Inclusion in 2008 addressing issues relating to [inter alia] regional divides’. Furthermore, the Council called on the Member States to ‘promote the roll-out of advanced seamless networks through the rapid implementation of national strategies, aimed at increasing broadband coverage and multiplatform access, and stimulating take-up, making use, where appropriate, of EU structural funds, in line with the Commission Guidelines’, and to ‘encourage effective use of ICTs by public services and businesses (especially SMEs), by promoting the necessary skills needed for their deployment, promoting interoperability and open standards, and effective on-line public services through the introduction of organisational change’. The proposed Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) also includes a programme for ICTs, including measures to improve interconnectivity, and is currently under examination by the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>In its communication of 20 March 2006 entitled ‘Bridging the Broadband Gap’, the Commission states: ‘The benefits of broadband are such that the inability to have access to it is an issue which should be addressed urgently.’ The communication contains a range of instruments aimed at improving the availability of broadband access. One of the Commission’s conclusions is that local/regional authorities are in the best position to plan broadband projects that take account of local needs and technical requirements. Measures might include strengthening national broadband strategies (as part of the Commission’s strategy for growth and employment as well as of the overall i2010 strategy), improved sharing of good practice, not least through the collection and shared use of information about projects and invitations to tender relating to extension of broadband services, as well as drawing up innovative, wide-ranging, pan-European pilot projects. A number of instruments are already available at EU level, including the implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communication, aimed at promoting competition and bringing state intervention into line with competition rules. The Commission’s communication is based on the Digital Divide Forum Report of 15 July 2005 and the ensuing public consultation and includes proposals for further policy guidelines for the Member States and the Commission. The Council will in due course look at all the proposals and examine whether further measures should be considered.</p>
<p>Two important conferences on this subject will be held during the Austrian Presidency. The annual Conference on the European Charter for Small Enterprises will take place in Vienna on 13 and 14 June 2006, where the state of implementation of the Charter will be discussed, and in April a seminar on ‘ICT-Tools for Providing Information, Advice and Services for rural SMEs’ will be held in Oulu (Finland).</p>
<p>In the longer term, and with a view to the imminent review of the electronic communications regulatory framework (Commission proposals are expected by the end of 2006), the Council will take full account of the convergence aspect of broadband technologies and ensure that the plans for an open, competitive and innovative market for electronic communication services are treated appropriately.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0243"></a>

<p>(DE)The honourable Member will undoubtedly agree that Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) make a substantial contribution to growth and employment in Europe and are thus an important resource for the attainment of the Lisbon Objectives. Moreover, investment in research and innovation is vital in order to enable the ICT sector to continue to make its contribution to the economy, in both the short and the long term.</p>
<p>In 2005 the Commission presented its strategy 'i2010' for a European information society, the second pillar of which is innovation and investment in research. In reply to the Commission, the Council stressed in its conclusions of December 2005 that the i2010 strategy was a matter for which the Member States, the European institutions and interested parties bore joint responsibility. The Council asked the Commission and Member States to promote investment in research and development in the field of ICT and to provide greater support for research and innovation by promoting private investment and cooperation between research and innovation programmes.</p>
<p>After the publication of the Aho report, the European Council called on the Member States at its spring summit to allocate more public funding to innovative research and to promote R&amp;D investment by the private sector in order to make more and better resources available for research and innovation. It also called for a broad-based innovation strategy for Europe, to translate investment in knowledge into products and services. In this context it called on the Commission and Member States to implement the new i2010 strategy energetically.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a decision establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) is currently being considered by the European Parliament and the Council. For the information society, Chapter II of this proposal ('The ICT Policy Support Programme') seeks to promote innovation by making greater use of ICT and by means of investment in this field. The provisions of the programme serve as an instrument to support the measures indicated in the i2010 strategy. As regards Community support for research and technological development, the honourable Member will be aware that the Commission proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme is currently being considered by the European Parliament and the Council under codecision. It is proposed that research and technological development in the ICT sector should be one of the main thematic priorities of this programme.</p>
<p>Finally it may be noted that on 22/23 March 2006 in Vienna the Austrian Presidency also organised a conference on 'Investing in ICT Research and Innovation'. The conference was intended as a follow-up measure to the Commission's i2010 initiative and served the purpose of identifying practical measures to increase Europe's innovativeness in the ICT sector. At present a final report on the results of the conference and the recommendations of the eminent delegates is being drafted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0113"></a>

<p>Between 1997 and 2000, Transrapid International carried out feasibility studies into the possibility of using Transrapid’s system of electromagnetic levitation in rapid transit systems in Central and Eastern Europe and further eastwards.

<p>(DE)The honourable Members have posed a number of questions on the relationship between the environment and transport.</p>
<p>Economic growth and the resulting increase in transport demand have an impact in a number of areas, with implications in terms of traffic congestion, traffic safety, health problems and environmental damage. In response to the 2001 White Paper 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide', the Council endorsed a shift from road transport to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport such as clean buses, ships and rail transport. Relevant concrete measures include guidelines giving priority to trans-European rail and inland waterway networks and legislation on the opening up of the market for rail freight services in Europe.</p>
<p>With a view to deciding on the most appropriate measures to be taken in future, the Council is awaiting the communication on the mid-term review of the White Paper. As this is expected to be submitted by the Commission shortly, the Austrian Presidency already has plans to present the communication at the Council meeting on 8/9 June 2006 and to hold an exchange of views on it.</p>
<p>The Council supports the use of the trans-European transport networks, the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund as European instruments for investing in transport. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, cities with excessive traffic congestion may apply to the Commission for funding. The total budget available for these instruments in the period 2007-2013 will, of course, depend on the outcome of discussions on the financial perspective.</p>
<p>As regards the levying of charges for the use of roads, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive on 27 March 2006 amending the directive in force on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Eurovignette). A particularly notable feature of this amending directive is a new provision allowing a mark-up to be added to the tolls for specific sections of the trans-European road transport network in mountainous regions which suffer from acute traffic congestion or the use of which by vehicles causes significant damage to the environment. The revenues raised by the mark-up are to be invested in priority TEN projects (mainly rail projects) which will contribute to reducing the problem. In addition to this provision on cross-financing of alternative infrastructure, the directive also provides for further possibilities for applying different charges within the trans-European network in order to achieve environmental objectives, and it specifies that the Member States are free to levy charges in order to combat traffic congestion and/or environmental impact (for example, the London congestion charge).</p>
<p>Pursuant to this directive the Commission is also required to submit within two years a model for the assessment of external costs. The model is to be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals, which - if submitted - will be examined by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)In April 2005, the Council adopted a partial general approach to the proposal for a Parliament and Council regulation on the second ‘Marco Polo’ programme for the granting of Community financial aid to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (‘Marco Polo II’).</p>
<p>The ‘Marco Polo II’ grant programme, which is intended to facilitate a changeover to alternative modes of transport, is of particular significance and high priority in view of the disproportionate increase in the transport of goods by road. When it is borne in mind that Marco Polo II will be able, between 2007 and 2013, to bring about the transfer of some 140 billion tonnes per kilometre from roads to means of transport with less of an environmental impact, with a corresponding reduction of 8 400 million kg of CO2 emissions and an environmental and social benefit amounting to EUR 5 billion, the importance of this programme is plain to see.</p>
<p>On 15 December 2005, the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted its own position on the proposal, and the Presidency has already embarked on the examination of the amendments that Parliament proposed.</p>
<p>It is indeed the case that - as the honourable Member points out – the standpoints of Parliament and of the Council have moved much closer together. The Presidency’s concern is that agreement should be reached as early as first reading, although the amendments proposed by Parliament have yet to be discussed in greater detail by the Council. It should be noted that the financial aspects of the proposal referred to above cannot be settled until agreement is reached on the Financial Perspective for 2007 to 2013, and that there is a need for a successor programme to run on seamlessly from the first ‘Marco Polo’ programme. The presidency looks forward to honourable Members’ continuing constructive support in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0279"></a>

This communication was an important contribution to the high-level meeting on inland waterways held by the Presidency in Vienna on 14 and 15 February 2006, in which representatives of the Member States, of third countries, of the Commission and of industry participated.</p>
<p>One item on the order of business for the 27 March 2006 Council meeting was exclusively devoted to inland shipping, when Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, had the opportunity to explain the Commission communication to the transport ministers, and Vice-Chancellor Gorbach, for the presidency, reported on the high-level meeting in Vienna. It was on this occasion that the Vice-Chancellor confirmed the Austrian Presidency’s intention to adopt, at the 8/9 June 2006 meeting of the Council, conclusions relating to this communication, which would be based on the results from the high-level meeting.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0194"></a>

The joint action plan between the EU and India (document 11984/05) states that the EU and India believe that cooperation between institutions of higher education and exchanges of students play an important part in raising the level of knowledge on both sides. It is therefore proposed that, on the basis of existing programmes, new initiatives be planned between India and the EU Member States to give students on both sides more opportunities to study at universities in the other region.</p>
<p>As regards the proposed European institute of technology in particular, however, it should be noted that the Heads of State or Government of the EU have yet to adopt a formal position on the Commission's plans and that a detailed proposal by the Commission on the establishment of such an institute is expected only later in the year.

<p>(DE)I would like to thank the honourable lady Member for this pertinent question on an issue that was of particular concern to the Austrian Presidency when it was preparing the European Council’s Spring Summit.</p>
<p>Negative population growth has long been a cause of concern for the European Union, and adaptation to it has become a political priority for an increasing number of Member States. The EU has, therefore, over recent years, developed political strategies intended to help anticipate the changes that result from increased life expectancy brought about by considerable advances in health care and by improvements in the quality of life in Europe, a larger number of workers over the age of 60, and consistently low birth rates.<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Following the Commission’s presentation, in March 2005, of its Green Paper entitled ‘Confronting demographic change – a new solidarity between the generations’, the Council, in December of that year, held a general discussion on the subject of ‘Demography and human capital’. The various contributions to this debate were mainly concerned with the need to improve the skills and qualifications of workers by means of lifelong learning, with the ‘work must be worth it’ concept, with the means of ensuring appropriate management of migratory flows and the need for work and family life to be reconciled.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, this topic is also of particular concern to the European Parliament, and I would refer in this context to your resolution on the contribution to the 2006 Spring Summit of the European Council on the Lisbon Strategy, particularly to the part of it relating to the ageing population and the demographic challenges. Your House also, at the end of March, debated the issue of the demographic challenges and of solidarity between the generations.</p>
<p>The Council takes the view that competitiveness and economic development can be promoted in Europe irrespective of these negative trends and that the EU and its Member States are capable of adapting themselves to such changes. It has therefore given its support to policy measures and strategies intended to contribute towards the resolution of this problem, especially by means of the revised Lisbon Strategy, through which the EU is to be endowed with the necessary framework in order to create jobs for people, especially for more women, young people and older persons.</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, this issue was raised at the meeting of the European Council on 23/24 March. In order to address the present adverse demographic trends in Europe, the European Council, in line with the 2005/06 Joint Employment Report that it adopted on 10 March, called on the Member States to adopt a lifecycle-centred approach to work that would ease the transition from one form of employment to another, to increase the number of hours worked, to develop a pro-active and preventive policy that would encourage people to seek paid work, focusing this on the less-skilled and less well paid; to reduce youth unemployment and to implement strategies for active ageing. All these measures should also take account of the situation of immigrants and minorities. The European Council also approved the European Equality Pact and agreed that the availability of high-quality childcare in line with the Member States’ targets should be improved.</p>
<p>The European Council called on the Member States to give attention to the topic of ‘Flexicurity – Flexibility through security’ and to act in accordance with an integrated flexicurity concept when reforming the labour market and social policy. The intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and social security in Europe. These two principles should not be seen as alternatives but rather as mutually complementary elements. The flexibility demanded by international competitiveness can be achieved in the labour market only on the basis of functioning social security and insurance systems.<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>At the 10 March meeting, the Commission presented to the Council the 2006-2010 timetable for the equalisation of women’s and men’s opportunities. This timetable sets out six priorities, namely: Equal economic independence for women and men, the promotion of the reconciliation of working life and private/family life; promoting the equal participation of women and men in decision-making processes; the eradication of sexual violence and of sex-related people-trafficking; the removal of gender stereotypes in society and the promotion of equal opportunities outside the EU. These targets and the associated core activities are intended to promote the harmony between work and family life.</p>
<p>I am sure that the honourable lady Member will agree that these are highly complex issues and that a concerted effort on the part of all concerned is therefore required if it is to be possible to overcome the problems that Europe currently faces.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to a recent study carried out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Europe's education performance indicators are falling further and further. France and Germany no longer feature on the list of leading countries in the field of education. On the contrary, those countries are the focus of criticism of their education systems, which the study describes as mediocre. In contrast to France and Germany, there is - in Europe - Finland, while the countries of Asia, led by South Korea, China and India, have been investing increasingly in recent years in their education systems, which is now bearing fruit. In particular, the OECD study shows that Europe is lagging behind Asia in terms of its education systems and, therefore, if it wishes to boost its competitiveness in this sector, it must invest more funding in education reform.</p>
<p>Does the EU intend to promote the creation of competitive, high-quality education systems based on equality and sustainable development, encouraging the related investment in the public and private sectors?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The Council assures Mr Mavrommatis that it shares the concerns expressed in his question and that – insofar as it is competent to do so - it is endeavouring to deal with these concerns at the highest level. It is now generally recognised that, with its adoption of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 and of the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme in 2002, the European Council has begun a process through which education has come more and more to the fore in the economic and socio-political programme of the EU. In 2005, in the framework of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the Council adopted integrated guidelines in which the Member States are asked to increase and optimise their investment in human capital and to gear their education and further education systems to new requirements in terms of qualifications. Clear evidence of this development was finally provided by the fact that, in February 2006, the EU education ministers accepted the joint interim report on progress under the work programme, which is to be fully implemented in accordance with the wishes of the European Council, and by the fact that the theme of education was given a prominent position in the conclusions of the Spring 2006 European Council.</p>
<p>In the light of the growing socio-economic and demographic challenges in a globalised world, the Council would therefore agree with Mr Mavrommatis that first-class education and training systems, which are both efficient and fair, are a factor crucial to increasing the EU’s competitiveness and economic performance and that, at the same time, they promote social cohesion. In terms of the reforms called for under the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme, considerable progress is already to be seen, since the Member States are making more efforts to put into effect coherent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies that are to provide everyone with the skills and qualifications they need. However, further efforts will undoubtedly have to be made, in the context of which the issue of funding will certainly be of crucial importance.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should therefore be pointed out that, in its latest conclusions, the European Council calls on the Member States to facilitate, in line with national practices, universities' access to complementary private sources of funding and to remove barriers to public-private partnerships with businesses. In addition, the Member States are called on to do what they can to bring about closer connections between universities, research and industry and so increase investment and the potential for innovation and competition. In that way, the EU will be able to hold its own among the best in the world. The Commission’s impending report to the European Council on university education should be extremely relevant in this connection, since the report will deal above all with the education-research-innovation triangle, as well as with the connections between universities and industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0233"></a>

<p>(DE)The Council shares the honourable Member's view regarding the significance of the Lisbon strategy for building a knowledge-based economy. The research framework programme represents a key Community instrument for achieving this aim. As the honourable Member will know, the European Parliament and the Council as the two legislative institutions are currently considering the Commission proposals for the seventh framework programme (2007-2013).</p>
<p>Pending the European Parliament's opinion and the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective, the Council reached a 'partial general approach' on the framework programme at its meeting of 28 November 2005; the corresponding text is publicly accessible. As the draft decision states, the programme will 'pursue the general objectives described in Article 163 of the Treaty (strengthening industrial competitiveness and meeting the research needs of other areas of Community policy) in contributing towards the creation of a knowledge-based society, building on a European Research Area'. Consequently the two institutions are now discussing the contribution that this programme might make to the knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>On the question of how the benefits of new technologies can be made available in all parts of Europe, the honourable Member is referred in particular to the sections 'Regions of knowledge' and 'Research potential' in the 'Capacities' part of the programme, which contain the following objectives:</p>
<p>'Strengthening the research potential of European regions, in particular by encouraging and supporting the development, across Europe, of regional “research-driven clusters” associating universities, research centres, enterprises and regional authorities';</p>
<p>'Stimulating the realisation of the full research potential of the enlarged Union by unlocking and developing the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions and outermost regions, and helping to strengthen the capacities of their researchers to successfully participate in research activities at EU level'.</p>
<p>It might also be recalled that, alongside this framework programme, the planned framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (2007-2013) is also intended to support the introduction of new technologies across the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0260"></a>

<p>(DE)The Austrian Presidency and the future Finnish Presidency attach the utmost importance to the issue of border controls. Particular attention is currently and will in future be focused on development of integrated border protection at external borders and increased cooperation with the countries of origin and transit of illegal immigrants, as set out in The Hague Programme and in the Global approach to migration: Priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean. The ongoing national and international cooperation between the authorities responsible and neighbouring States at the external borders on combating crime and the exchange of information will also continue to play an important role in the future.</p>
<p>The newly created European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) plays a key role in this context. This Agency is responsible for the coordination of operational cooperation between Member States in the field of management of external borders, among other things by carrying out joint operations at land, sea and air borders. A number of joint operations have already taken place and others are planned in the near future. The Agency also carries out risk analyses, gives assistance to Member States in the training of national border guards and in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance. The Agency will also provide Member States with the necessary support in organising joint return operations.</p>
<p>It should, however, be pointed out that responsibility for the control and monitoring of external borders is a matter for the Member States. In order to support Member States in this task, the Council is currently discussing a range of further measures referred to in The Hague Programme and the Global approach to migration. These comprise, in particular, the proposed External Borders Fund and the inclusion of biometric identifiers in travel documents.</p>
<p>In addition, the customs authorities of the Member States are cooperating with a view to tackling drug smuggling, counterfeit goods and so on even more vigorously and effectively. Although operational activities still remain within the jurisdiction of the national authorities, the Customs Cooperation Working Group is continuing the long tradition of joint customs actions. OLAF and Europol provide the necessary support for such measures and, wherever possible, there is a cooperation with other authorities such as the police and border protection forces.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0264"></a>

As short a time ago as in the run-up to the most recent presidential elections, the Council on many occasions expressed its concern to Russia about the infringement of fundamental human rights and democratic standards in Belarus. At OSCE level too, the EU raises the subject of the situation in Belarus and emphatically calls on that country to comply with its obligations in the context of the OSCE. The problems in Belarus are also discussed with representatives of the Russian Federation at meetings involving the EU Troika.</p>
<p>Where economic relations between Russia and Belarus are concerned, we should also like to draw your attention to the announcements made a short time ago by Gazprom, according to which the price of the gas to be supplied to Belarus in 2007 is to be increased. It is currently EUR 39 per 1000 cubic metres, which is far below that paid by the EU Member States or the countries bordering on Belarus. The EU will monitor these developments carefully.</p>
<p>The EU has also, in connection with the presidential elections in Belarus, called on Russia to use its influence on Belarus and to promote compliance with human rights and democracy in that country. As long as the situation in Belarus does not improve, these appeals will continue to be made.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0278"></a>

<p>(DE)The present answer, which was prepared by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor the Members of the Council, was not given orally at Council Question Time at the European Parliament’s plenary in Strasbourg in April 2006.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency of the EU pays particular attention to the development and transposition of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Cooperating closely with the Commission and the Council Secretariat, the Presidency is carefully monitoring the implementation of the ENP action plans already agreed last year with Ukraine, Moldova, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia.</p>
<p>The Presidency also intends as soon as possible to conclude the negotiations regarding action plans involving Egypt, Lebanon, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.</p>
<p>What is very important for the further development of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Early acceptance of the corresponding regulation and implementing provisions is accorded high priority by the Presidency. This is to be seen as particularly urgent in view of the automatic expiry of the TACIS Regulation on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p>The European Parliament plays a crucial part in this process, and the Presidency hopes for constructive cooperation with a view to reaching agreement on a compromise document at first reading so that the instrument might enter into force on 1 January 2007. In this way, a smooth transition from the current neighbourhood programmes (2005-2006) to the new cross-border cooperation programmes (2007-2013) would be possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0287"></a>

<p>(DE)In its reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0110_EN.html">H-0110/06</a>, put at Question Time in March 2006 by a Member of this Parliament, the Presidency presented the EU’s position on the human rights situation in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>As Mr Van Hecke will remember, the Council Presidency has already explained in its answer that, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the political dialogue with Ethiopia has regularly given EU representatives opportunities to express their deep concern regarding the human rights situation in that country, on several occasions in face-to-face conversations with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. The EU representatives have talked about the situation of the detainees. They have also demanded that everyone arrested during or following the June and November demonstrations be released and that their relatives and lawyers, together with representatives of humanitarian organisations, be guaranteed access to them. EU representatives have visited detainees in several camps and prisons.</p>
<p>I should like to point out to Mr Van Hecke that efforts have been made to ensure independent international monitoring of the court proceedings against leading opposition figures and others. EU representatives have also expressly called on the government to prevent any harassment of the opposition and of civil society organisations by security forces. At a political level, the EU has also pressed for a dialogue between government and opposition to be unconditionally entered into and called on the political leadership to enable the private media to operate freely.</p>
<p>The EU will continue carefully to monitor the situation in Ethiopia and to raise these subjects with the authorities, at which time it will press for the detainees’ rights to be respected and all human rights issues affecting the detainees to be resolved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0291"></a>

<p>(FR)The issue of workers’ mobility in the EU’s outermost regions forms part of a wider process of reflection on the European Year of Workers' Mobility. Against this backdrop, a debate has got under way involving the various stakeholders – for example, public authorities, socio-economic actors – with the aim of looking into the conditions under which workers are posted in the EU. The objective is to ensure the primacy of the right to mobility and to enhance the available instruments, (the European network for information on employment and worker mobility (EURES) and the Structural Funds), and in turn to create an environment that is conducive to mobility.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds cover a significant proportion of the island population, with more than 95% eligible for Objectives 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In the current programming period 2000-2006, the Structural Funds provide a large amount of financial support for island, rural and geographically remote regions where development is lagging behind, less favoured regions or regions in decline, under Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The objective of regional policy is to promote sustainable development in these territories, ensuring that those living and working there continue to go about their business under the best possible conditions. The European Social Fund (ESF) can also cofinance the costs of posting the trainee or the trainer where the type of training in question is carried out in an outlying region.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming programming period 2007-2013, which places the accent on developing human potential in the field of research and innovation, it will be possible to fund the posting of trainers or trainees, as well as other activities such as connecting people and businesses in these territories with transport networks and water, electricity and telecommunications services.</p>
<p>Development policy covers all rural areas in the Community, including island and geographically isolated areas, both for the current programming period 2000-2006 and for the next programming period 2007-2013. Rural areas account for some 90% of EU territory. The main priority of a number of measures under Axis 3 – diversification and quality of life in rural areas – will be job creation and the conditions for growth, thereby contributing to the objectives of more and better jobs and better quality of life in these areas.</p>
<p>Lastly, the future Axis 4 of the European Fisheries Fund also provides for measures aimed at creating jobs and at improving living conditions in EU fishing regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0224"></a>

<p>(EN)In a Cohesion Policy and the Rural Development perspective, the Commission encourages the respect and implementation of the partnership principle, which consitutes a fundamental element for the implementation of European cohesion policy. This principle calls for close cooperation between the Commission and the authorities not only at national but also at regional and local level in the Member States during the different stages of the implementation cycle of the Structural Funds and of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD).</p>
<p>Partnership with local authorities was already present in the guiding principles of the 1988 reform of the Structural Funds and the Rural Development policy and was strengthened with the subsequent reforms of EU cohesion and Rural Development (RD) policies, by enlarging the scope of partnership and the circle of partners.</p>
<p>For the next programming period, the partnership principle will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the future Council Regulations for 2007-2013. The Commission’s proposal seeks to reinforce this principle since it considers that the participation of regional and local authorities contributes to legitimize the decision-making process by introducing a bottom-up approach. Regional and local authorities can also contribute to the transparency of decisions and decision-making processes through their involvement and through their channelling of information. Furthermore, in many cases the involvement of regional and local authorities contributes to the development of institutional capacity at territorial level. To facilitate the involvement of local or regional authorities, their institutional capacity has to be strengthened, their awareness on European structural policy has to be extended, and a more effective dialogue between the different authorities has to be established.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework proposed for the 2007-2013 period has many similarities to the current one in relation to the involvement of local authorities since it allows Member States to implement the partnership principle in accordance with national practice. There are a number of good examples where regional and local authorities can play a more active role in the future:</p>
<p>The urban actions, where the involvement of the local authorities both in the design and in the management of the programmes is critical to their success. The Commission proposes to the Member States the possibility to sub-delegate, within regional programmes, management responsibilities to these authorities;</p>
<p>Social inclusion actions, co-financed by European Social Fund (ESF), are typically small scale local bottom-up projects which have achieved important impact on the local level, and which will constitute, where appropriate, a priority for ESF interventions;</p>
<p>Cross-border and inter-regional cooperation programmes give an increased possibility to local authorities to take an active part in the programming and management of programmes and actions;</p>
<p>Local authorities qualify for Intermediate bodies which gives them a large responsibility and involvement in the implementation of the programmes and actions under the structural funds.</p>
<p>The new Regulatory framework provides new opportunities for local authorities with the extension of the use of global grants.</p>
<p>Local authorities can receive assistance thanks to the new JESSICA initiative (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) which is a framework for enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the European Investment Bank, the Central European Bank and other International Financial Institutions on financial engineering for sustainable urban development. Its objective is to provide a ready-made solution to financing projects for urban renewal and development using a combination of grants and loans.</p>
<p>In rural development areas (diversification of rural economy, improvement of the quality of life in rural areas) local authorities can play a key role when it comes to implement local development strategies.</p>
<p>Under the Leader approach in rural development where the involvement of the local partners (including the local authorities) is a prerequisite for the partnership and bottom-up arrangements put forward by the Local Action Groups in view of the approval of their local development strategies within the RD programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0227"></a>

<p>(EN)Article 158 of the Treaty establishing the European Community lays down that the Community shall "aim at reducing disparities in the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas." This implies that investment financed by the regional policy should have a permanent and sustainable impact in terms of real economic convergence.</p>
<p>Our means to achieve it are both financial and regulatory.</p>
<p>In financial terms, regional policy is based on the principle of the concentration of investment on the poorest areas of the EU. This principle was confirmed in the conclusions of the European Council in December 2005, which agreed that some 82% of the resources would be concentrated on the 35% of population living in the least developed Member States and regions.</p>
<p>Along with the money available for financial transfers, regional policy is based on the regulatory environment which determines how and where this money can be spent. For the next financial perspective the utmost priority is given to those investments which contribute the most – and in a sustainable way – to the growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Commission’s proposed general regulation, the resources of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund should be used for investment in physical and human capital according to priorities set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines. In anticipation of the adoption of the regulation, and in order to create the conditions to allow Member States sufficient time to prepare new programmes for the beginning of 2007, the Commission decided to present the Guidelines in draft form to Council and Parliament in July 2005. The Guidelines draw on the relevant “integrated guidelines” for Lisbon strategy and set out three over-arching priorities:</p>
<p>- to make the EU a more attractive place to invest and work in;</p>
<p>- to transform the Union into an area of high growth, competitiveness and innovation;</p>
<p>- and to return Europe to full employment, with more and better jobs.</p>
<p>Moreover, on a recommendation of the Commission, the European Council in December 2005 called for transparent targets to be set in order to ensure that a minimum percentage of the resources available under cohesion policy supports the Lisbon strategy. The setting of the percentages, known as “earmarking”, is such that a minimum of 60% of resources in convergence regions and 75% elsewhere should be invested in the implementation of Lisbon over the next period. Although, according to the December EU summit conclusions earmarking is compulsory only for those Member States which made up the Community before enlargement in May 2004, the Commission spares no effort to convince also the new Member States to adopt earmarking approach, on the voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the main objectives for the new programming period is to maximize the leveraging effect of the regional policy investments. Today, regional policy leverages €1,5 of the private capital (for each euro funded by the EU) in the Objective 1 regions and €3 in Objective 2 regions. In the future this effort must be intensified. To provide more financial leveraging the Commission encourages a better and wider use of the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for the projects financed by the regional policy.</p>
<p>It is in the light of the concentration of resources on investment in the least developed Member States and regions, and a more targeted and disciplined approach in accordance with the Community Strategic Guidelines and the earmarking arrangements, that the aim of real convergence will be pursued in the next period.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0242"></a>

<p>(EN)Under the Interreg II cross-border programme between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which operated from 1994 to 1999, three Border Corridor Groups received support for the development of strategies and integrated plans for the border corridor. The Border Corridor Groups comprise 18 local authority districts on both sides of the border. In order to develop their roles the Border Corridor Groups agreed to form and promote the establishment of Interreg IIIA Partnerships to build a new model of cross border co-operation for strategic development under the current Interreg IIIA programme for 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Irish Central Border Area Network Interreg IIIA Partnership (ICBAN) is one of the current three cross-border Interreg IIIA Partnerships, along with the East Border Region Interreg IIIA Partnership and the North West Region Interreg IIIA Partnership acting as Implementing Agents for Measures 1, 2 and 3 of Priority 1.</p>
<p>These Partnerships have been actively engaged in achieving their strategic and operational responsibilities in the programme and the Managing Authority has been proactive in the development and promotion of these Partnerships in recognition of their important role.</p>
<p>The Update of the Programme’s Mid-Term Evaluation<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, carried out by independent evaluators, supports this assessment. The evaluators state:</p>
<p>“A unique element of the current Programme is the involvement of the three Interreg IIIA Partnerships, which are responsible for delivering 30% of the Programme funds. The Partnerships, which were established by the Border Corridor Groups, endorse a bottom-up approach and involve a mix of statutory and social partners. The Partnerships have added value to the Programme by bringing local knowledge and expertise (…) and ensure a high level of engagement for local community networks. Furthermore, the work of the Partnerships as well as the array of projects funded across the Programme, have produced a collaborative ‘dividend’ through stimulating cross border dialogue, cross community working and contributed to objectives of the Peace Programme and delivery of the Common Chapter. Likewise the programme has offered a unique opportunity for Government Departments, North and South, to engage in genuine cross border cooperation.”</p>
<p>In the case of ICBAN, the participating Member States, have selected the partnership as one of the delivery vehicles for the cross-border programme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The information available to the Commission, in particular the evidence from the programme’s mid-term evaluation, suggests that the work of ICBAN has been more than satisfactory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Operating in the context of the national and regional cohesion programmes supported by the Structural Funds of the European Union for the period 2007-2013, the Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is designed to promote greater access to finance and risk capital for small and medium enterprises, and to develop micro-credit. Among the principal characteristics of JEREMIE are, firstly, that the resources contributed by operational programmes to JEREMIE funds are expected to lever in additional loan capital or equity resources from the international financial institutions, financial intermediairies or other investors, and secondly, that assistance provided through venture capital, loan or guarantee funds to develop micro-businesses and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) under JEREMIE must be repayable and recycled even beyond the end of the programming period 2007-2013,</p>
<p>In order to establish the conditions for both leverage and recyclability (which means that the same contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) would normally be used more than once in support of businesses), the Commission has proposed that the contributions made by the managing authorities under operational programmes to funds or holding funds as part of the JEREMIE initiative should be eligible, under ERDF rules, for re-imbursement as interim payments.</p>
<p>These particular characteristics do not apply to advance payments to aid schemes taking the form of non-repayable grants to enterprises. The appropriate treatment of the latter as regards the question of interim ERDF payments remains subject to negotiations in the Council in the Structural Actions Working Group.</p>
<p>In this context, it should be noted that, as today, the draft regulations for 2007-2013 provide for advance payments from the Structural Funds, which make resources available to the authorities immediately on adoption of operational programmes. Such advance payments vary from 5 % to 10.5 % of the total contribution of the Structural Funds over the seven-year period, which corresponds to between 40% and 70% of an annual allocation. This pre-financing of programmes by the Union is designed to provide the necessary liquidity to the authorities in the Member States so that they in turn can pre-finance projects as appropriate or make advance payments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Before preparing operational programmes at national and / or regional level, the Member States are now in the process of finalising the National Reference Strategic Frameworks (NRSF) based on the draft Strategic Guidelines for cohesion elaborated by the Commission<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There is no standard practice followed by the Commission in order to ensure an overall European added value through coordination of all programmes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure coherence between neighbouring programmes and the NRSF is a tool which may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cross-border co-operation among border regions has been supported via the Structural Funds for over 15 years. This will continue in the next programming period. This co-operation is organised through integrated co-operation programmes covering both sides of the border at the same time. Evidently, projects implemented through these programmes are automatically co-ordinated by both sides of the border. In some cases, where there is more than one programme per border, the neighbouring programmes maintain close contacts to ensure co-ordination and to avoid duplicating efforts.</p>
<p>In relation to the larger amounts of funding available under the “Convergence” and “Regional Competitiveness and Employment” Objectives, which is the main gist of the question, programmes are implemented on a national or regional basis within the particular Member State and they have therefore not necessarily been co-ordinated with the other side of the border thus far.</p>
<p>Given the amounts of funding available in the next programming period, especially for the new Member States, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that such co-ordination would indeed contribute to providing additional European added value. Co-ordination on large environmental and transport projects, for example, which are located close to borders, can only bring benefits to all participants.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore envisages raising this issue during programme negotiations with Member States and regions, in order to assess what steps will be taken to ensure the necessary co-ordination during programme implementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission considers that the cross-border programmes could contribute to this co-ordination, as these programmes are one of the key meeting places for the two sides of a particular border. Such a co-ordination role for the co-operation programmes could certainly be increased in the future, provided that there is a genuine desire amongst the Member States and regions concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Accordingly, it has launched a communication effort based around four axes.</p>
<p>First, the three initiatives were launched at a major conference of the Commission with around 500 participants from the regions, financial institutions and social partners, held in Brussels on 24 November 2005. The Commission intends to use all opportunities provided by events on the theme of European Cohesion Policy to explain Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission, together with the European Investment Bank group and other international financial institutions concerned, has organised technical meetings, both on the ground in the Member States themselves and in Brussels, to inform the national and regional authorities on Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica Initiatives. Participants have included representatives of managing authorities and (in the case of Jaspers) major sectoral ministries such as transport and environment, and (in the case of Jeremie) finance and economics ministries and regional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Third, modern information technology tools are being developed by the Commission, including the creation of web sites and web pages dedicated to Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica. A web page on Jaspers is already online<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN)European Union cohesion policy is committed to deliver progressively to the Lisbon agenda. Research, development and innovation will play a major role in the future cohesion policy. They are thus among the suggested priorities for convergence regions, for competitiveness and employment regions and for the European territorial cooperation objective.</p>
<p>The suggested guidelines for research and development in the forthcoming cohesion policy funding period cover better cooperation, both among business and between business and public research and universities, supporting research and development in SMEs, better cross-border and transnational cooperation in research, and strengthening relevant capacity building, including ICT, infrastructures and human capital.</p>
<p>The future cohesion policy programs can build on rich and comprehensive experiences from the current funding period, for which about € 10.5 billion will be invested in research, technological development and innovation. The three main areas of investment are projects for applied and pre-competitive research, research and innovation infrastructures and support for innovation and technology transfer. Seven out of ten € from the Structural Funds for these investments are spent in regions lagging behind in development.</p>
<p>Investment in Human Capital is a vital element in strategies to invest more in research and development. The Funds will co-finance a wide range of actions which will directly contribute in this respect, and ensure synergies to ensure coherent strategies on national and regional level.</p>
<p>The work on the National Strategic Reference Frameworks for the next cohesion policy funding period is ongoing, and of course other services are invited to participate, and Directorate General Research is doing so. Key elements for the research part of these documents, as well as for the forthcoming operational programs, are well elaborated and ambitious strategies, such as from EU supported actions carried out by Regional Foresight and Innovative Actions, improved cooperation and coordination between public and private research, to look for result oriented research paving the way for innovation, and increasing research relevant investments from abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to the fostered and more strategic focus of cohesion policy on research, development and innovation, the cooperation between the Directorates General for Research and Regional Policy also bears fruit in the opposite direction, with the explicit integration of the regional dimension in the seventh Framework Program as a cornerstone. One of the four programs in this framework, the capacities program, enhancing research and innovation capacity throughout Europe, will contain it. Amongst others it includes the development and use of research infrastructures and SMEs' research activities in specific areas. Thus, the latter, being the hinges between research and innovation on the one hand and commercialisation on the other hand, thereby driving growth and jobs, are supported by both policies, each from their specific angle.</p>
<p>Initiated by the Parliament the pilot action on Regions of Knowledge has progressed during the two call periods in a way that for the seventh Framework Program it will be a scheme of its own. Further, the suggested scheme on unlocking research potential in the European Union convergence regions will support the purchase of equipment and the roll out of conferences on technology transfer as well as seconding of research staff.</p>
<p>This enumeration is not exhaustive, but demonstrates that the cooperation to integrate regional policy and research is progressing substantially, and in both directions. This will allow for a real boost in contributions to all three levels identified by the Aho report<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>: market conditions that are favouring research and development, more mobility of researchers and the creation of European-wide lead markets for the most important technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with the auto de-commitment rule ("n+2") the financial resources from the EU Structural Funds for Poland for the period 2004 - 2006 (total amount of about €8.6 billion) should be spent by the end of 2008 so they would not have to be returned to the EU.</p>
<p>The Polish Government recently published a report on forecasted expenditure from the Structural Funds. The 'optimistic option' assumes that till the end of 2006 Poland will be able to spend at most 43.2% of the allocated amount i.e. €3.7 billion. This indicates that about €4.9 billion are to be spent over the next two years.</p>

<p>(EN)The target of spending 43,2% of the total 2004-2006 structural funds allocation by the end of 2006 means avoiding the risk of de-commitment due to n+2 rule for the whole amount committed in 2004 and for 2/3 of the amount committed in 2005. In reality, this would be a very good result for Poland because the payments for 2004-2006 commitments are not supposed to be distributed evenly between 2004 and the end of 2008 (the end date for claiming payments under the structural funds due to the n+2 rule).</p>
<p>In other words, it is difficult to expect that, by the end of 2006, Poland or any other new Member State spends 60% of its total structural funds allocation in the current programming period. The reason for this is a time gap between the moment when the commitment is made and the moment when the work on the project can start – due to the project selection, tendering and contracting.</p>
<p>For example, in the largest Operational Programme (OP), the Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP), claims for more than €200 million have now reached the Commission, meaning that decommitment of funds committed for this programme in 2004 is not in question anymore.</p>
<p>As to the major problems concerning implementation of Structural Funds in Poland they are mostly due to the lack of experience in the application of Community law (public procurement rules and environmental impact assessment). Another group of problems concerns too complex and bureaucratic procedures, especially with regard to payment collection and certification. However, this is far from unusual in new, or even older, Member States, and the evidence suggests that many of the initial problems have now been overcome and effective steps are being taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0290"></a>

<p>The new generation of cohesion policy programmes in 2007-2013 aims to increase coherence between cohesion policy and the Lisbon agenda and between cohesion policy and other Community policies. The synergies with research policy have therefore received considerable attention. They take two forms:</p>
<p>First, as set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion Policy, we propose to increase and improve investment in RTD through the Structural Funds. The guidelines identify four priorities for investment in this respect:</p>
<p>strengthening co-operation among businesses and between businesses and public research/higher education institutions by supporting the creation of regional and trans-regional clusters of excellence;</p>
<p>supporting RTD activities in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and enabling SMEs to access RTD services in publicly-funded research institutions;</p>
<p>supporting regional cross-border and transnational initiatives aimed at strengthening research collaboration and capacity building in priority areas of EU research policy;</p>
<p>strengthening R&amp;D capacity building, including information and communication technologies, research infrastructure and human capital in areas with significant growth potential.</p>
<p>Synergy with Research Framework Programme 7 (FP7) is therefore present through both the general objectives and through specific links. The general aim will be to build up research and innovation capacity in all regions, thereby increasing their competitiveness and enable participation in FP7.</p>
<p>Secondly, there will be specific complementarities in terms of:</p>
<p>certain areas of investment (e.g. major European research infrastructures, increasing the potential of research teams in convergence regions, emerging and existing centres of excellence, researchers' training and conditions);</p>
<p>implementing of the research strategies developed under FP7’s 'Regions of Knowledge'.</p>
<p>There will therefore be links between the policies throughout the strategy-formulation and implementation cycle of the Structural Funds programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0244"></a>

<p>(EN)Asset prices in the EU have been rising steadily for several years, reflecting a global trend. Much of the increase in asset prices can be attributed to the conditions of ample liquidity, which have characterised the international financial system since the late 1990s. The expansion in liquidity has been associated with very low short-term interest rates and has encouraged investors to bid up the price of longer-term assets in a search for higher returns.</p>
<p>In some of the Member States, asset prices – including the price of housing – have risen very rapidly and have reached very high levels by historical standards. It is difficult to determine the extent to which these markets may be overvalued. However, such high asset valuations need to be monitored carefully because of the risk that an abrupt correction in these markets could have serious implications for the performance of the economy of these Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at an aggregate level, such as for the euro area or the EU as a whole, there are no particular risks arising from such developments in asset prices.</p>
<p>The Commission monitors the situation in asset markets on a regular basis in the context of its economic surveillance of the EU and Member States. On this basis, the Commission has the opportunity to discuss asset-price developments with the Ministers of Finance and the European Central Bank at the monthly meetings of the Ecofin Council and the Eurogroup.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0245"></a>

<p>(EN)In terms of potential growth, Europe is indeed lagging behind several of its main competitors. The reasons might be seen in lower utilisation of labour and secularly declining productivity growth. There is a wide consensus among analysts that this hardly satisfactory situation reflects to large degree structural weaknesses of the European economy. The Lisbon Strategy was devised to address these weaknesses and to raise the level of potential growth. However, since the launch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000, it has proven difficult to make simultaneous progress on these two fronts. The increased contribution of employment to EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was initially offset by a reduction in the contribution from labour productivity.</p>
<p>Commission analysis indicates that the deteriorating labour productivity performance can be attributed to a lower investment per employee and a slowdown in the rate of technological progress. The former can be partially explained by a higher rate of job creation, the argument being that the newly created jobs tend to be low-productivity jobs. Moreover, low incentives to invest are also associated with a poor business environment, especially as regards regulation. The latter reflects Europe’s industrial structure with a relatively low share of high value added activities and which has been slow to adapt to the intensifying pressures of globalisation and the associated acceleration in technological progress.</p>
<p>The Lisbon strategy was relaunched last year - as the growth and jobs strategy - with a clear focus on facilitating implementation of measures most conducive to raising growth and employment, as set out in the Integrated Guidelines. It is based on a partnership between Member States and the European Institutions. This comprehensive and coordinated strategy, which contains reform measures in labour, product and services markets at both national and Community level, is also the EU’s main tool to face the implications of ageing populations and the challenges posed by globalisation.</p>
<p>The Growth and Jobs Strategy attempts to promote labour market reforms that would guarantee appropriate security for workers while allowing the market to adapt quickly to changes in the economic environment. Further measures are aimed at enhancing the quality of human capital and promoting R&amp;D and innovation activities. In particular, furthering lifelong learning for low-skilled workers will also contribute to strengthen productivity growth. Also, improvements in the business environment, including better regulation, and the promotion of sound competition in markets are essential.</p>
<p>In the context of the renewed Growth and Jobs Strategy, Member States have presented their national reform programmes in autumn 2005. The Commission has evaluated the programmes in its Annual Progress Report. In that report it has also proposed to place a particular emphasis on near-term reforms in the four areas of knowledge and innovation, the business and regulatory environment, responses to globalization and ageing, as well as energy policy. The Spring European Council has endorsed the Commission’s Annual Progress Report, and the implementation of the National Reform Programmes and the Community Lisbon Programme at Community level are now under way.</p>
<p>The likely impact of the growth and jobs strategy on the growth potential of the European economy is considerable. A recent study commissioned by the Commission has shown that the full implementation of the objectives of the Growth and Jobs Strategy could raise per capita GDP in the EU by almost a quarter. This demonstrates the great positive potential of vigorous reforms as well as the opportunity cost of not doing so.</p>
<p>Any government measures that could impinge on the functioning of the internal market would go against the objectives of boosting efficiency through optimal allocation of resources and exploiting the growth potential of the European economy to the fullest extent.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0248"></a>

<p>This report shows how rules on recording of military expenditures were applied by the Greek authorities since 1995 onwards and includes also the correspondence exchanged by Eurostat and the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) on the issue.</p>
<p>It is Eurostat understanding that in the past, until 2004, Greece had decided to record military expenditures at the time of actual physical delivery.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as indicated in the "Report of Eurostat on the revision of the Greek Government deficit and debt figures", published on 22 November 2004, page 17, "it was admitted that only a relatively small fraction of deliveries was captured". This resulted in a "severe under-estimation of government expenditure" due to the fact that "no information on deliveries was ever received by the NSSG and the Ministry of Finance since 1997". The decision to record military expenditure according to cash payments was therefore accepted by Eurostat due to the impossibility of implementing correctly the method of deliveries in the past. Therefore "the shift to cash accounting was not determined by methodological reasons but because of feasibility considerations. Given the confidential nature of data on deliveries in Greece, only cash accounting can guarantee that no expenditure was left unrecorded".</p>
<p>As indicated in the news release of Eurostat n. 31/2006 dated 9 March 2006, on the recording of military equipment expenditure, there is no need to revise figures on military expenditures carried out by Government in the past, as "Member States might choose not to change their methods when reporting the years 2002-2004, in the case of contracts involving only pre-payments".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A recent Eurostat decision published on 9 March 2006 states that Member States' expenditure on defence equipment should be entered in the accounts at the time of delivery and not at the time of purchase. However, given that expenditure on defence accounts for a significant portion of government spending, it is obvious that incorrect methods of recording it may result in giving the impression that a country's public deficit exceeds the prescribed ceiling of 3%.</p>
<p>In Greece, the present government changed its method of recording its defence expenditure in 2004 in a way which is not consistent with the recent Eurostat decision, the outcome being that the public deficit for the period 2000-2003 appears to exceed the 3% limit.</p>
<p>In the light of the new Eurostat decision, should the Greek Government not revise its method of recording its defence expenditure for the 2000-2003 so as not to give the impression that Greece joined EMU on the basis of false data?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The recent decision of Eurostat released on 9 March 2006 requests for long term contracts for purchases of military equipment that: "in the case of military equipment built over many years, the time of government expenditure, and thus the impact on government deficit, is at the time of actual physical delivery of the final product and not at the time of transfer of ownership, which is often staged during the building process."</p>
<p>At the same time in the case of unavailability of source data Eurostat has foreseen "as it is an acceptable practice, as an interim solution and pending improvement of accrual based source data, that government military equipment expenditure be recorded on a cash basis, or derived from cash-based information." This solution is acceptable only for the following three cases:</p>
<p>a) cash data are corrected with observed and accurate data on receivables and payables associated with the contracts in question; or</p>
<p>b) he cash data are used for small deliveries only, or are corrected for large deliveries; or</p>
<p>c) the time of payment is close to delivery (within one year of the time of delivery).</p>
<p>It is Eurostat understanding that in the past, until 2004, Greece had decided to record military expenditures at the time of actual physical delivery.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as indicated in the "Report of Eurostat on the revision of the Greek Government deficit and debt figures", published on 22 November 2004, page 1 , "it was admitted that only a relatively small fraction of deliveries was captured".

<p>In March 2005, the Council explicitly recommended to Hungary to take effective action in order to reach its budget deficit targets as set out in its updated convergence programme. In its decision of 8 November 2005, the Council stated clearly that the timing and implementation of any tax cuts are to be conditional upon the achievement of the budget deficit targets (Decision 2005/843/EC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>In this respect, the Council underlines that the policy behind the budgetary stance in the programme needs to be substantiated to ensure its consistency with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2008. Moreover, according to Council's recommendation, the budgetary outcome could be much worse unless the fiscal measures underpinning the fiscal objectives are specified and strictly implemented. It is in view of the above assessment that the Council considers that effective fiscal action is required.</p>
<p>Finally, it is stated that if the Council considers that no effective action has been taken in response to the recommendations addressed under Article 104(7), it must take a decision to that effect.<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Commission is entrusted with budgetary surveillance and monitoring the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure.

<p>(EN)The question refers to two aspects of budgetary surveillance, the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and the assessment of the Stability and Convergence Programmes, which are both relevant for Hungary.</p>
<p>On the basis of a Commission Recommendation, the Council has addressed twice a Recommendation to Hungary under Article 104(7) EC. This was done first in July 2004 and again in March 2005. In the latter, the Council indeed recommended to Hungary, among other things, to "make the timing and implementation of any tax cuts conditional upon the expected achievement of the deficit targets". In both cases, the Council subsequently decided under Article 104(8) EC, on a Recommendation from the Commission, that the action taken by Hungary in response to its recommendations was not effective.</p>
<p>As Hungary is not yet a member of the euro area, the two steps of the EDP under Article 104(9) EC and 104(11) EC, and particularly the option of imposing sanctions in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, do not apply. However, on a Recommendation from the Commission, the Council may issue a new Recommendation based on Article 104(7) EC. Such recommendation would take into account any relevant recent developments, such as an adapted convergence programme update to be submitted by 1<span class="sup">st</span> of September 2006.

<p>The Schengen Agreements and the British Government's decisions relating to them are creating a shocking situation in the Calais region. A constant flow of more than 200 migrants, fleeing war and misery, who are victims of international mafias which traffic in persons, converges on the Calais region, in the hope of reaching England. This situation is, first of all, intolerable for the migrants, who live in appalling conditions. It also makes unreasonable demands on the local population and causes considerable economic damage, with a very adverse impact on employment. The European Union is entirely responsible for this state of affairs.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission has to recognise that the situation highlighted by the Honourable Member of illegally staying migrants congregating in the Calais area is not a new one.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to be absolutely clear about what has already been done to address this situation, where responsibilities lie regarding dealing with the migrants, and how we can address the problem in the global sense demanded by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>For or five years ago the shelter at Sangatte provided temporary refuge for migrants. This explained why people decided to undertake dangerous journeys across Europe. Some hoped to join friends or relatives. Some hoped to escape poverty. Some sought work. Some escaped persecution and/or racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The solutions that were found at that time – to close down the shelter; to grant United Kingdom (UK) work permits to some migrants; to return some to their countries of origin and to process asylum applications for those who asked for international protection – were effective in the short term. These solutions were not a panacea. They did not address the root causes of migration or any other reason pushing people to leave their own countries and to which the Honourable Member refers. The EU immigration policy seeks to tackle the root causes of migration and to find lasting solutions to the problems faced by several Member States.</p>
<p>The UK is not part of the Schengen area and the checks at its borders are the result of an autonomous, legitimate political choice. The Commission has no powers, nor any competence to oblige the UK to change its policy in this regard. One point is, however, clear. There is no correlation between the fact that the UK does not participate in Schengen and the serious problems in Calais.</p>
<p>These issues are complex and deeply-rooted. They require a series of comprehensive measures and actions, both at national and EU level, in order to deal with them effectively.</p>
<p>For those who may require protection, the situation has changed significantly since the days of Sangatte. The EU has agreed on a package of measures on asylum so as to ensure that those seeking protection in any country in the EU are guaranteed minimum standards as regards reception conditions, qualification as a refugee and procedural guarantees. This set of measures also addresses the issue of which country should be responsible for determining an asylum claim.</p>
<p>Our common migration and asylum policy went further in 2004 with the adoption of the Hague Programme – the European Council's workplan for Justice and Home Affairs adopted in November 2004. The Hague Programme promotes a comprehensive approach to complete a Common European Asylum System, foster legal migration for economic purposes, strengthen integration measures and introduce important new actions designed to combat illegal immigration with resolve.</p>
<p>In response to the Hague Programme, on 1 September 2005, the Commission adopted a set of policy proposals which included a Directive on common standards on returning third-country nationals and concrete ideas aimed at tackling illegal immigration and its root causes through the strengthening of links between migration and development policies in the countries of origin and transit.</p>
<p>With regard to the Honourable Member's concerns for victims of trafficking, the EU has intensified its efforts to address the issue of trafficking, including migrant smuggling, in its political dialogue with third countries. This approach supports anti-trafficking initiatives in third countries through development co-operation and other instruments.</p>
<p>An EU Plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing Trafficking in Human Beings was adopted by the Council in December 2005.</p>
<p>The global approach set out by the Commission in September 2005 was broadly endorsed by the European Council in December 2005 in their paper on priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>That paper includes as priorities:</p>
<p>Increased operational co-operation between Member States, primarily with a view to tackling illegal migration in the Mediterranean region and to saving lives at sea;</p>
<p>developing dialogue and cooperation with Africa including joint efforts to fight illegal migration, and other measures to address the root causes of migration;</p>
<p>cooperation with neighbouring countries, particularly in Northern Africa to prevent illegal immigration and to improve the capacities of their asylum systems and measures to manage legal labour migration from them.</p>
<p>The Commission, in close co-operation with Member States and the FRONTEX<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Agency, is currently working on the implementation of these measures. It will prepare a written report on these measures by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to present a new Communication this spring which will evaluate the measures carried out until now, assess the need for additional initiatives and set future priorities to combat illegal immigration with resolve.</p>
<p>Obviously, longer term EU strategies and proposals take time to agree and implement – but there is more immediate, concrete and tangible assistance which the EU can offer to address the situation in the Calais region.</p>
<p>France has funds available under the European Refugee Fund to assist it in dealing with any immigrant claiming asylum and EU funding is now available to help with the return of illegal migrants to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>The existing programmes ERF, ARGO, AENEAS and the “Preparatory actions for Return” are all available to enhance Member States' capacity to manage migration and related issues.</p>
<p>As of 2007 the situation should substantially improve with the adoption of the new funds for Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows, proposed by the Commission for the period of 2007-2013, which include an External Borders Fund, a European Refugee Fund as well as a European Return Fund and an Integration Fund.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing AENEAS programme, a share of the EU’s financial instruments for external relations will also be devoted to migration-related issues.</p>
<p>As far as a remedy to the economic damage which may be caused by the presence of illegal immigrants in the Calais area is concerned – it would be necessary first to substantiate the precise nature of such "economic damages" and to establish the link with illegal immigration which the Honourable Member assumes. The Commission should, of course, underline that the responsibility for concrete operative measures to deal with illegal immigrants on their territories and with illegal work lies solely with the Member States themselves. The Commission is not itself involved in law enforcement operations on the ground and Member States have been encouraged for several years, within the framework of the Lisbon agenda, to tackle the issue of illegal work, which acts not only as a pull factors for migrants but also undermines the credibility of EU policies in the field of migration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The objective of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is to achieve “good environmental status” of the EU’s marine environment by 2021. The proposed Directive does not identify specific measures to be taken to achieve this objective. This is justified by the diverse conditions, problems and needs in the different EU Marine Regions that require tailor-made solutions, so the planning and execution of measures are left to the regional level. A more prescriptive approach would neglect the diversity of situations across Europe.</p>
<p>On costs, the Impact Assessment<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> estimates administrative and policy costs to amount to about €90 million for the initial phase and slightly above €70 million after this period. As programmes of measures may greatly differ for each Marine Region, so will their impacts, costs and benefits. The proposed Directive requires detailed impact assessments of measures introduced to ensure cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Today the EU is not in a strong position to deal with third countries with which it shares seas. Interaction with them takes place mainly within regional seas conventions. EU Member States often do not make every effort to co-ordinate their actions in the absence of clear EU policy. The Marine Strategy provides a platform through which the EU will articulate its views to third countries more effectively. This will improve our negotating position. The Strategy will also become part of the acquis with which many third countries have to approximate their legislation as part the European Neighbourhood Policy or bilateral agreements with the EU. We expect this to give an additional positive impact on the state of the marine environment in EU seas.</p>
<p>On the launch of a pilot project for the implementation of the Strategy, this has not been considered to date. The Commission will continue to encourage efforts to stimulate exchanges and cross-fertilisation between the regional seas conventions.</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Maritime Policy to be adopted by the Commission before the end of the first half of this year will raise questions and suggest answers with respect to further action to develop sustainable maritime activities on the basis of the ecosystem-based management proposed in the Marine Strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is shortly to complete a review that it started at the end of October 2005 on bank accounts opened or operated by staff members other than the Commission’s Accounting Officer.</p>
<p>This review had two aims:</p>
<p>to confirm the existence of all assets and liabilities of the Commission in the form of bank accounts used for the purposes of the EU budget;</p>
<p>to clarify the rules with the various authorising departments of the Commission concerning the opening and use of these bank accounts, in order to assess their continued usefulness.</p>
<p>For this exercise a distinction has to be made between the bank accounts opened within the borders of the European Union (EU) and those opened outside the EU.</p>
<p>The accounts which have been opened outside the EU are for the most part managed jointly by the Cotonou Agreement states with countersignature from Heads of EC Delegations on European Development Fund (EDF) projects and programmes. They are still being reviewed and the completion of this verification will take some more time</p>
<p>18 bank accounts were identified within the borders of the EU. These accounts fulfil different purposes:</p>
<p>to manage revenue of sales of publications;</p>
<p>to comply with national legal requirements (a disputed lease guarantee for a Delegation building, source of pension contributions for local staff, contested recovery procedure);</p>
<p>to provide small loans to staff in urgent need of help under the terms of the interinstitutional Committee for Social Actions (involving Court of Justice, Parliament, Court of Auditors and Commission and chaired by the Head of Personnel of the Court of Justice);</p>
<p>to manage “Restaurant” and "Economat" activities in Brussels, Luxembourg and Ispra;</p>
<p>The accounts are held by the Publications Office (4), Eurostat (2), DG Communications (2), DG Administration (1), the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels (5), Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Luxembourg (3), and the Joint Research Centre in Ispra (1).</p>
<p>Nothing unexpected has therefore emerged from this review. No irregularities were found and no personal profit has been ascertained. The opening of an account for a disputed lease guarantee on the Delegation in Prague should have been formally opened by the Accountant, and should have been closed, if no dispute had occurred. This account still remains open in the Commission’s accounts. It has nevertheless been correctly accounted for and no financial loss or personal profit has been ascertained in this case either.</p>
<p>The Commission has lodged with Parliament a complete list of these accounts and their state as of 30th November 2005. That list contains details about the legal bases under which they were opened and operate. Where possible, accounts that are no longer really needed will be closed.</p>
<p>Such a review was already carried out in 2002, but not in such detail. It was repeated in 2005 in line with the modernisation of the accounts and the move to an accrual based accounting system to identify all assets and liabilities of the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has found this inventory exercise useful and will repeat it regularly. The Commission expects to confirm the nature of the accounts mentioned by the Commission delegations by end April 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0216"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission received several complaints pointing out that the Royal Decree 1665/1991 of 25 October 1991 implementing Directive 89/48/EEC was applied incorrectly by the Spanish authorities with regard to the recognition of engineer qualifications.</p>
<p>After having obtained the academic recognition of their Spanish qualifications from an Italian university, the concerned persons passed the Italian state examination which confers the right to pursue the activity of engineer in Italy. They are therefore holders of an Italian professional qualification and are fully qualified to practise the profession concerned in Italy.</p>
<p>Their application for recognition of their Italian professional qualifications by Spain does not constitute any circumvention of the recognition system instituted by Directive 89/48/EEC. The Commission considers that the refusal to recognise the Italian professional qualification in question is contrary to the Directive.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spanish authorities make access to any promotion exam within the public sector dependent upon the academic recognition (by the Spanish authorities) of the diplomas acquired in other Member States. This requirement is also contrary to Directive 89/48/EEC which gives Community nationals who are fully qualified and hold the prescribed diploma to practise a profession in another Member State, the right to practise the same profession in that Member State under the same conditions as nationals. In other words, engineers who are fully qualified to practise the profession of engineer in Italy and who have obtained the recognition of their professional qualifications in Spain do not have to obtain any additional academic recognition of their title if this is not required from Spanish nationals practising the same profession.</p>
<p>The Commission opened an infringement procedure against Spain and sent a reasoned opinion on 5 July 2005 to which Spain replied on 20 September 2005.</p>
<p>Spain's response is under examination and the College will decide in its forthcoming meeting on infringement cases what further steps to take.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)In the context of the new Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013, a distinction should be drawn between the indicators which are used for designating Article 87.3.a regions (those regions which are most in need of support in the EU and may therefore be eligible for the highest rate of aid), and the indicators which are used for designating Article 87.3.c regions (those regions which, although still lagging behind in terms of regional development, are comparatively less disadvantaged and may therefore be eligible for a lower rate of aid).</p>
<p>In order to ensure coherence with the cohesion regional policy proposals, and in agreement with a very large majority of Member States, the Commission has continued to identify regions eligible under Article 87.3.a of EC Treaty on the basis of regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (in Purchasing Power Standards). To take any other approach would mean that the State aid rules would not be fit coherently with the structural fund regulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Member States have a broad margin of discretion in designating regions as eligible for aid under Article 87.3.c, provided that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that aid is targeted appropriately. It is the responsibility of each Member State to demonstrate that the areas proposed are relatively more in need of economic development than other areas, using recognised indicators such as GDP per capita, employment or unemployment levels, or local productivity or skills indicators. Within the limit of the total population coverage allowed for each Member State, it is the responsibility of the Member State itself to determine both the methodology for designating regions as eligible for aid, and the economic indicators that are to be used to target regional disparities, even where those disparities are very localised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0230"></a>

<p>(EN)The creation of a High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment was announced by the Commission in its Communication of 5<span class="sup">th</span> October 2005, “Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing - towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy”. It is part of seven announced or already established cross-sectoral initiatives aiming at addressing the common challenges across groupings of different industries in order to create long-term stable framework conditions for the different sectors. The Group has been set up by Commission Decision of 23<span class="sup">rd</span> December 2005 according to the rules established in the Communication C(2005)2817 and Commission Staff Working Document SEC(2005)1004 which set out the general rules and procedures applicable to Commission expert groups (e.g. on structure, composition and terms of reference).</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the High Level Group is to foster greater coherence between competitiveness, energy and environmental policies. The main task of the group is to give advice to the Commission, as well as to policy makers and stakeholders on fostering the consistency of policy/legislative initiatives in the domains of competitiveness, energy and environmental policies through closer coordination. It will also advise on how to create a more stable and predictable regulatory framework in the policy areas concerned.</p>
<p>The group has only an advisory role with no other power. The High Level Group is not a comitology committee. It will not weaken the legislator’s capacity or restrict the Commission’s right of initiative. This is not an inter-institutional coordination or negotiation group. The Commission will not seek a formal position from the other Institutions involved and has no intention of by-passing the inter-institutional procedures foreseen in the Treaty.</p>
<p>The members of the group have been invited ad personam for their personal competence and responsibility in the areas of industry, energy and the environment. Even Ministers in the group do not represent their governments. The focus is on the voluntary personal contribution of knowledge and not on geographical distribution of the members of the group. In addition, the Commission has attempted to gather together those with a background in the specific fields to advise the Commission on how to find appropriate balances between public/private interests and also between civil society/industry interests, rather than looking at national interests or geographical balance. The group will gather information pertaining to the situation in the EU-25, inter alia through hearings and by collecting written material. That will ensure that the group’s advice is based on the actual situation in the EU-25. The Commission is not planning to set up any other groups in this field.</p>
<p>There is no direct link between the group’s activities and new legislative initiatives. Moreover, according to the Better Regulation principles new initiatives must undergo an impact assessment. Such an impact assessment may indicate the need for addressing the needs of new Member States specific requirements and such impact assessments are completely beyond the scope of the group.</p>
<p>The High Level Group shall not duplicate the work of other groups, committees or fora that already exist and the group’s activities are not focussed on the Lisbon Strategy. As far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned there are specific fora where the discussion on the ways to achieving its goals, including reviewing the National Reform Plans, is taking place. Regarding the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, there are no groups addressing separately the challenges specific to the EU-10 or the EU-15 Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0232"></a>

<p>(EN)As far as wine-making practices are concerned, wines imported from the United States (US) and offered for sale to European consumers will be labelled in accordance with Community rules as EU wines are. The consumer then makes the choice.</p>
<p>It would not be in the Community’s best interests to engage in unjustified negative discrimination against the wines of any third country the Community has negotiated an agreement with, especially when the parties are to continue negotiations to achieve additional mutual benefits in the future.</p>
<p>As regards the question on Community ‘names of origin’ (Community geographical indications), like ‘Nemea’, on the one hand and on the 17 European wines names, commonly known in the US as semi-generics, like ‘Retsina’, on the other hand, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>- Community ‘names of origin’ will be recognised and protected in the US via the US labelling provisions.</p>
<p>- When the change of the legal status of the 17 famous EU wine names, which are currently considered in US law as semi-generic names, is adopted by the Senate, these 17 Community names will then be reserved to wines originating in the Community.</p>
<p>As the change of the status of these EU wine names in the US is of extreme importance to the EU wine sector, the most important provisions of the Agreement for the US have been linked to this change, in particular the approval of the other existing US wine-making practices. This link creates a real incentive for Congress to act.</p>

<p>The Commission expects to receive the outstanding reports in due course.</p>
<p>The Community rules on the transport of dangerous goods by road which have been in place since 1994 are based on international agreements. Considering that an estimated 620 million tonnes of dangerous goods are transported by road (EU 15 – about 5% of all road transport), it is generally felt that this transport mode has a good track record.</p>
<p>The implementation of the European legislation lies with Member States. The Commission has no reason to believe that the Swedish authorities do not apply the legislation correctly.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to point out that the legislation does not require municipalities to appoint safety advisers for dangerous goods. It furthermore does not require permanent checks at bridges or other infrastructure installations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)For the period 2007-2013, talks are ongoing to thrash out the terms of an agreement on the new financial perspective at interinstitutional level.</p>
<p>The Commission will draw the appropriate conclusions from the final results. It will take account of the funds available, and endeavour to propose priorities on sections with the highest value-added, in particular cross-border sections.</p>
<p>The appointment of six European trans-European transport network coordinators will not have any detrimental effect on the funding of specific priority projects. The coordinators' main task will in fact be to help certain projects that are currently dogged by uncertainty to move forward.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that work on the trans-European transport networks in the territory of the new Member States, for example most of the Gdansk – Warsaw – Brno/Bratislava – Vienna project (PP 23), could enjoy funding under the cohesion funds and the European regional development fund.</p>
<p>Lastly the Commission would inform the honourable Member that there is to be a special heading for the future funding of the Galileo project.

<p>The Commission has decided today to introduce protective tariffs on shoes from China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Danish Government has carried out a study which shows that the costs to EU consumers are eight times greater than the profits to manufacturers and that, in total, the Union will lose € 2.4 million if the Commission introduces such tariffs. Overall, Swedish consumers can expect to pay almost SEK 60 million more for their shoes.</p>

<p>(EN)Within the framework of the European anti-dumping legislation, the Commission is indeed bound to consider the wider European interest in determining its response to dumping practices. The Commission recognises that any action it takes can impose some cost – however small – on importers and European consumers, and the Community interest principle requires that it weigh these costs carefully and act on the basis of the wider European interest.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that studies on the impact of measures on consumers and other economic operators have been carried out by the Danish Government. However, the Commission cannot comment on those results, in particular because the details of those studies have not been made available to the Commission.</p>
<p>What the Commission can however do, is share with the Honourable Member the conclusions that it reached with respect to any impact of measures on the overall European Union consumers.</p>
<p>When assessing the effect of the measures on consumer prices, one has to take into account the considerable margin that exists between import prices on which measures are applied, and consumer’s prices.</p>
<p>At the level of the provisional measures proposed, the duty would be just over € 1.5 on average import prices of about € 9 per pair. This duty of € 1.5 however only represents a fraction of the consumer prices, since these shoes sell for € 40 to 120 at retail level.</p>
<p>Given the margins within the supply chain, the Commission also believes that there is room in the sector to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain. It is therefore realistic to believe that the duty would on average not represent more than € 1 per pair. And it should be underlined that this case concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every 100 pairs bought by European consumer – a fraction of the product range.</p>
<p>Of course the cumulated effect of the measures should also be seen in the light of the considerable size of the European footwear market. At wholesale level it indeed represents about € 13 billion, and probably more than the double at consumer level.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be stressed that import prices for shoes from China and Vietnam have fallen by more than 20% in the last five years, while we have clear evidence that retail prices for these shoes have remained stable or even risen slightly.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission believes that the measures proposed constitute a balanced solution. It corrects the injury, but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0246"></a>

<p>The third soft fruit harvest since Poland joined the European Union is now approaching. Despite the fact that, from the very outset, Polish Members of the European Parliament have been drawing attention to the very difficult situation in the soft fruit market, the Commission has not so far proposed any measures to improve the situation. On 11 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables, in which it urged the Commission to provide greater support for producers' organisations and introduce import restrictions in the soft fruit market. The Commission did not take these measures in 2005 and there are no indications that it will do so in 2006.

The Delegation has also met regularly with Dr Mugraby in the past to hear his views, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that it is utterly unacceptable that somebody is being prosecuted for expressing freely an opinion and this in front of an EU institution such as the Parliament.</p>
<p>Together with Member States and with the support of the Parliament, the Commission is working towards a strengthened political dialogue with Lebanon for cooperation on Human Rights and Democratisation in the framework of the Association Agreement, and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).</p>
<p>The Commission is about to start negotiations with the Lebanese Government on an ENP Action Plan, in which we will address issues such as human rights and democracy as key priorities. The Action Plan will also aim at addressing the need to develop an independent and impartial judiciary. We are convinced that the Action Plan will be a useful tool to support the Government in addressing important and needed reforms in these areas.</p>
<p>Through the Association Agreement and the Neighbourhood Action Plan we can further support Lebanon’s respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in line with its international commitments.</p>
<p>The Commission has raised the case of Dr Mugraby on various occasions with the Lebanese Government. Among others, on 22 December an EU Troïka démarche was carried out with the Lebanese authorities to express the EU’s concern over the charges against him.</p>

<p>The RoHS Directive covers equipment depending on or generating, transferring or measuring electric currents or electromagnetic fields as well as equipment falling under Annex IA to Directive 2002/96/EC (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) which does not exceed certain volt limits mentioned in Article 3 (1) of this Directive. In its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document, which is published on the "Europa" web site,<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the Commission has provided (legally-non binding) guidance for the Member States on the interpretation of the scope of this Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is, at this moment, analysing whether and, if so, to what extent, organ pipes are covered by the scope of the RoHS Directive. To this end, the Commission has, as a first step, consulted the Member State experts in the Technical Adaptation Committee, in order to obtain an overview of the national situation. Once the Commission has finalised its assessment it will make its findings public in the above-mentioned FAQ document.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to make clear that even if organ pipes were to be covered by the scope of the RoHS Directive, it will have no impact on pipe organs which were already on the market before 1 July 2006 or on their repair even after this date. In this case, producers of 'new' pipe organs, which will be put on the market after 1 July 2006, could apply for an exemption.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Commission has committed itself to review the RoHS Directive by 2008 at the latest in order to simplify and clarify its provisions, insofar this would be appropriate. In order to prepare for this review, the Commission has started a fact-finding exercise on the current implementation problems with respect to this Directive, including its scope.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As a result, no answer has been given to the question whether the Commission will take the opportunity offered by the forthcoming review of the existing legal framework for telecommunications to opt out of sector-specific price and access regulation in its draft directive, or at least to set a clear deadline for ending such regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, one wonders – particularly in the context of a European comparison of the market situation in the broadband area – whether it is true that in a number of European countries the demand for broadband connections has been boosted by tax concessions and the massive input of regional subsidies from the EU budget. What role does this development play in assessing the market situation, and how is it taken into account by the Commission when carrying out market comparisons?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)With respect to the first part of the question from the Honourable Member related to the withdrawal of price and access Regulation, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an opt-out of sector-specific price and access regulation as part of the forthcoming review. It is already a fundamental principle of the current framework that such Regulation must be withdrawn once there is effective competition on the relevant market. For that reason, it is not possible to set in advance a clear deadline as by when Regulation could be withdrawn. The respect of that principle provides the requested level of stability and predictability which are key requirements for investment and innovation in the electronic communications sector.</p>
<p>Concerning the second question, broadband has experienced the fastest take-up amongst communication technologies in recent times. The total number of broadband lines has quadrupled in the past 3 years and the EU25 penetration rate has reached 13% of population in January 2006.</p>
<p>The impact of public intervention on broadband take-up is difficult to measure for various reasons. First, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of public intervention from the impact of competition and of other socio-economic factors. Second, public intervention often takes place at the regional and local level, while broadband statistics are normally available at the national level. One example where the impact has been measurable is given by Italy, where financial incentives (€75 for residential and business broadband access) have enabled more than 350,000 new connections in 2004.</p>
<p>Regional aid has been granted in the less developed regions of the European Union, in particular in rural areas. Indeed, broadband tends to be lacking in areas that are scarcely populated and remote as these characteristics entail high deployment costs. In January 2005, broadband reached more than 90% of households and businesses in urban areas, but only about 62% in the rural areas. Only about 8% of households subscribe to broadband in the rural areas, compared to an average rate of 18% in urban areas.</p>
<p>In general, in rural areas there is a positive relation between broadband availability and demand: take-up is higher in those countries where broadband is more widely available. This means that lack of access does constrain potential users, and that public intervention to bring broadband to these areas is likely to have a positive effect on take-up.</p>
<p>The Commission carries out market comparisons in various contexts. First, developments in broadband take-up are analysed by the Commission in the Implementation Report<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Implementation Report looks at the impact of regulation on take-up in the relevant markets. Market analysis is carried out at the national level with the purpose of assessing the potential significant market power of the incumbent operator. The analysis does not distinguish between entry stimulated by regional aid and entry brought about by market forces.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission compares markets in terms of broadband availability. The Digital Divide Forum report, for example, includes the description of several examples of regional aid, but the analysis is not comprehensive<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Regional aid is not always notified to the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently adopted the Communication ‘Bridging the broadband gap’<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> as part of the implementation of the i2010 initiative. The communication recalls the broadband gaps and the instruments available at the EU level to help bridge them (regulatory tools, competition policy, cohesion funds), proposing the strengthening of the exchange of best practices and of national broadband strategies. Together with national broadband strategies, expected to provide information on concrete actions and measures, a web site will collect information from regions and provide further examples. This information will hopefully help the monitoring of the various regional and local initiatives and facilitate the analysis of their impact.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This would serve a dual purpose: biomass, the energy of the future, would enjoy vital support, while rural regions would have a stable financial future. However, restructuring farms for this purpose would entail costs. In Poland, this problem is of concern inter alia to the province of Swietokrzyskie and the regions of the south.

<p>(EN)As set out in its recent biomass action plan<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and biofuels strategy<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member in favouring increased use of crops for energy purposes.</p>
<p>It is taking this objective forward through efforts to promote research and development; develop technical standards; and establish an appropriate framework for trade in biomass.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the European Union has adopted the Biofuels Directive<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Directive on Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources<a href="#defann_62_4" name="refann_62_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. These directives require Member States to promote renewable energy and to set national indicative targets for its use. Biomass energy is the dominant source of renewable energy in transport, and also has a key role to play – alongside wind power – in the electricity sector.</p>
<p>Member States are implementing these Directives through measures such as tax exemptions for biofuels, biofuels obligations for fuel suppliers, feed-in tariffs for producers of electricity from renewable energy and green certificates. These measures work by stimulating the demand for renewable energy. The Commission is currently examining the scope for similar measures in heating, although it should be borne in mind that the problems are different here and perhaps more difficult to solve through Community legislation.</p>
<p>On the supply side, the Community has no dedicated support programme for renewable energy but there are already existing support tools, which will be continued in the next programming period and of which Member States may decide to make extended use. The Commission's most important tools to support renewable energy projects are the regional and rural development funds. In this context, energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy and sustainable transport have been put forward by the Commission as strategic priorities for the next budgetary period. For example, the Community strategic guidelines for rural development in the next programming period<a href="#defann_62_5" name="refann_62_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> place climate change mitigation among the prominent objectives to be pursued with this policy, and the rural development regulation<a href="#defann_62_6" name="refann_62_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> provides for several measures to contribute to this objective. The Commission calls on Member States and regional authorities to take initiatives in these areas.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Reform 2003 a specific aid for energy crops has been introduced. The amount of this aid is €45 per hectare for a maximum guaranteed area of 1.500.000 hectares at EU-25 level. In the 8 new Member States (including Poland), however, which have opted for the application of the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS), according to the present rules this aid scheme cannot be applied. However, these new Member States may decide to grant their farmers a complementary national direct payment for energy crops after authorisation by the Commission. Poland has used this possibility in 2005 and was authorised to grant a payment of €55, 46 /ha for short rotation coppice with a maximum area of 5 500 ha from the national budget. According to our information, Poland is planning to grant complementary national direct payments for energy crops in 2006, as well.</p>
<p>The Commission shall submit a report to the Council by 31 December 2006 on the implementation of the aid for energy crops scheme and, where appropriate, accompanied by proposals taking into account the implementation of the EU biofuels initiative. These proposals may result in further adjustments to the scheme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission would note that, once the financial perspective 2007-2013 has been adopted, the budgetary authority will, on an annual basis, be responsible for setting the amounts and for the breakdown of appropriations among the various Community budget items.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that the initiative and responsibility for realising trans-European transport networks priority projects rests with the Member States concerned. According to the programme provided by the Greek authorities, the following timetable has been set out for the Greek priority projects:</p>
<p>Priority Project 7: the via Egnatia is expected to be completed by the end of 2008 and the Pathe axis by 2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 21: work is planned for some of the major Greek ports for 2007-2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 22: the Athens – Promahonas railway line is expected to be completed by 2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 29: the construction of the Kozani – Igoumenitsa section is planned for 2007-2012 and the Ioannina – Kalamata section for 2009-2014.</p>
<p>During the 2000-2006 period, Greece used trans-European transport network appropriations for the cofinancing of studies, whereas the work has been cofinanced by the European regional development fund and the cohesion funds. Given that the priority projects in Greece are largely cofinanced by the structural funds, any reduction in trans-European transport network appropriations would have a comparatively limited impact on the development of these projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0274"></a>

<p>Since China became a member of the WTO, Chinese textiles and other products have been completing the destruction of the industries of certain EU countries. The EU restricts imports of only 10 categories of Chinese textiles. However, imports of such products as socks and tights, coats, jackets and linen have increased dangerously. This transfers production of these articles outside the EU. While imports from China are increasing, Community imports are not, because such developing countries as Indonesia, Bangladesh, etc. are being supplanted on the European market. The Commission has given a political commitment to cease imposing market protection measures on China in accordance with the special provisions relating to textiles adopted when China acceded to the WTO Protocol. However, another mechanism exists, for example the Transitional Product-Specific Safeguard Mechanism (TPSSM), which applies to certain products from the People's Republic of China. Does the Commission not intend to apply these measures?</p>

<p>(EN)One of the reasons why China has been gaining market shares all over the world and in the EU in recent years is because of its comparative advantages, such as low labour costs, which has attracted investment in labour intensive industries (China accounts for 60 percent of the world’s textile machinery). Therefore, Chinese success in the textile and clothing sector is not down to China’s World Trade Organisation (WTO) Membership. On the contrary, being a WTO Member obliges China to abide by internationally agreed trade standards, i.e. fair trade practices.</p>
<p>The EU’s policy cannot be regarded as accelerating delocalisation and outsourcing in the textile sector. In 2005, EU imports of textiles and clothing increased slightly, showing a trend similar trend to previous years.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member as far as China’s market economy status is concerned. This question is relevant in the context of trade defence policy. The Commission addresses this issue, among others, in the EU-China Market Economy Working Group, which was set up in 2004. While progress in some areas can be acknowledged, other areas still leave room for considerable improvement. The Commission, together with other WTO Members, has repeatedly aired its concerns in the WTO Committee on Subsidies regarding trade distortions caused by Chinese subsidies and has reminded China of its transparency obligations in this field under WTO rules.</p>
<p>As far as the specific textile and clothing trade policy is concerned, the Commission reiterates the rationale of the arrangement reached in 2005 by the Commission, which was backed by the Member States at the Coreper meeting of 7 September. The compromise of June and September 2005 (Memorandum of Understanding of 10 June, as complemented on 5<span class="sup"> </span>September) is a once and for all deal. The Commission takes the view that this overall deal strikes a reasonable balance between the legitimate need for the EU industry for protection while granting additional breathing space to adapt to a quota-free world. It also reflects the difficult balance the Commission has had to strike between retailer, importer, producer and consumer interests in the EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that an overall deal of this kind is preferable to a unilateral imposition of quantitative restrictions, as permitted by China’s special WTO safeguard mechanism. The Commission wants to avoid a situation of permanent negotiation in our overall relations with China. The above-mentioned overall deal gives a degree of clarity and predictability to operators, including in the EU industry. Any other option would be detrimental for both parties. Furthermore, this agreement covers the most sensitive EU products (the 10 categories referred to). It is the most favourable possible in a context where more than half of the Member States have gone to considerable lengths to accept quantitative limits that are detrimental to their retailers, thus showing solidarity. Reopening negotiations is not an option. In this context, it is the maximum that could have been extracted from China in terms of an agreed limit on their exports against the background of their WTO obligations.</p>
<p>Other WTO members (e.g. the US, Brazil) have taken the EU approach in this strategy, and have reached similar agreements. Both the US and the Brazilian agreements cover 2008, although it should be noted that they entered into force only in 2006 (not yet in Brazil’s case), and do not cover the year 2005, unlike the EU agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0285"></a>

<p>(FR)In conjunction with the committee of aviation safety experts, the Commission deems that, in spite of their recent efforts, the civil aviation authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continue to encounter difficulties in complying with applicable safety rules. These shortcomings are among the common criteria that the Commission is obliged to take into account when determining whether a carrier should be subject to a total or partial ban.</p>
<p>Other failings on the part of Hewa Bora Airways (HBA) have come to light in the past. Here again, these problems are among the criteria that the Commission has to take into account. Nevertheless, Belgium and HBA have provided information showing that, in the case of this carrier, these shortcomings have largely been rectified for one aircraft. Belgium has also informed the Commission that it is intending to subject HBA to systematic inspections.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission has decided to place all registered carriers in DRC, except HBA, on the list of carriers subject to a total operating ban (Annex A of Regulation (EC) 474/2006). HBA may continue its activities in the Community but solely with the equipment mentioned in Annex B of the above-named Regulation.</p>
<p>The Community list is updated where necessary. An inspection takes place at least once every three months. The process of updating the list may involve removing a carrier from the list if it has rectified the shortcomings that led it to be put there initially.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0288"></a>

<p>In a recent question (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-4745_EN.html">E-4745/05</a>), I raised the problem of the high cost of mobile telephone services in Greece (high termination fees). In its answer, after confirming the fact, the Commission pointed out that it had invited the Greek regulator (National Telecommunications and Post Commission of Greece - EETT) to tackle the problem more actively and to ask mobile network operators to reduce the call termination fees to a lower and cost-oriented level within a period of 18 months. The problem in Greece is huge as the average cost of the termination fee is reportedly between 15 and 18 euro cents per minute of talk-time, whereas the corresponding cost in the EU is estimated to be between 9 and 11 cents.</p>
<p>Given that Law 3431/2006, bringing Greece into line with Community provisions, has now been published, could the Commission say in what specific manner it intends to intervene with the EETT in order to speed up the procedures so that the termination fees are reduced without delay within a shorter period than 18 months?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)With regard to the debate in France on the introduction of more flexible labour contracts for young people (i.e. "Contrat Première Embauche"), the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its analysis on flexibility and security in labour markets.</p>
<p>In the framework of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, the Commission has considered that the current balance between flexibility and security in many Member States has led to increasingly segmented labour markets, with the risk of augmenting the precariousness of jobs, damaging sustainable integration in employment and limiting human capital accumulation. Greater attention should therefore be given to establishing efficient conditions of "flexicurity".</p>
<p>Recognising that each Member State starts from a different position, the Commission has identified four elements it considers essential to strike a good balance between flexibility and security in labour markets.</p>
<p>Firstly, the availability of contractual arrangements providing adequate flexibility for both workers and employers. Proliferation of different forms of contracts should be avoided and sufficient homogeneity between these forms of contracts should be preserved to facilitate transitions between them.</p>
<p>Secondly, active labour market policies should support transitions between jobs, as well as from unemployment and inactivity to jobs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, credible lifelong learning systems should enable workers to remain employable throughout their working life.</p>
<p>Fourthly, modern social security systems should adequately support workers during absences from the labour market and facilitate labour market mobility and transition.</p>
<p>The Commission would also refer the Honourable Member to the Conclusions of the European Council of 23/24 March 2006 which reiterate the urgency to improve the situation of young people in the labour market and to reduce significantly youth unemployment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0292"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission has undertaken a number of important initiatives towards improving its cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries and thereby contributing to an increased protection of the Mediterranean environment.</p>
<p>The enlargement of the Union in 2004 prompted the Commission to propose the now agreed European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), under which Action Plans have already been agreed with five partners in the Mediterranean, and consultations are ongoing with further two partner countries.</p>
<p>These ENP Action Plans foresee concrete cooperation to enhance good environmental governance in the partner countries, to address sector specific environment issues (e.g. water management, waste management, marine environment, desertification, nature protection, air quality, sustainable maritime transport) as well as vigorous pursuit of international and regional environment cooperation (including ratification and implementation of multilateral environmental agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols).</p>
<p>The implementation of the Plans is pursued in the context of the Environment and Transport Subcommittees set up under the Association Agreements. In this context, we will be supporting, as well as monitoring, the implementation of the agreed actions of the Action Plans, including with regard to implementing the obligations the partner countries have undertaken under the Barcelona Convention and other relevant legally binding environment agreements. Future financing under the 2007 - 2013 EU budget will also be important here.</p>
<p>The 10<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary Summit of the Barcelona Process celebrated in November 2005 agreed on a Five Year Plan of targetted cooperation with the partner countries. One of the targets agreed is the "de-pollution of the Mediterranean by 2020". The Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a timetable of actions towards achieving this target. The resulting "Horizon 2020" initiative is expected to promote financing of environment infrastructure in the region. It may also seek to enhance the capacities of the partner countries’ environment administrations as well as to promote environment research, in so far as these issues are not already dealt with within the implementation of the ENP Action Plans. Horizon 2020 will seek to bring together all important environment actors in the Mediterranean, such as the Mediterranean Action Plan, toward a common goal. The Council and the Parliament will be informed on this programme of work through a Communication in 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission has made protection of the marine environment one of its priorities, through the adoption of the European Marine Strategy,<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which will deliver the environmental pillar of a Future Maritime Policy. The Strategy, which includes a proposal for legislative action, is intended to set in motion a process by which EU Member States will cooperate between them as well as with non-EU States to develop and implement regional strategies for the protection and conservation of the marine environment. This will necessarily rely upon better use and implementation of all relevant EU enviromental policies (bathing water, Habitats Directive, Water Framework Directive, etc) as well as relevant regional policies (those developped within the Mediterranean Action Plan, for instance).</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Maritime Policy to be adopted by the Commission before the end of the first half of this year will raise questions and suggest answers with respect to further action to develop sustainable maritime activities in the Mediterranean on the basis of the ecosystem-based management proposed in the Marine Strategy.</p>
<p>Also, as a result of the Pollution prevention and response Protocol adopted in January 2002 and entered into force in March 2004, an ad hoc Strategy was adopted in 2005 by the Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention. This strategy will be implemented by the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea (REMPEC) which operates within the framework of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). It contributes to bridging the gap between the Mediterranean countries that are not members of the EU and those that are members, through promoting a coherent, effective and uniform implementation of the relevant international conventions and rules aimed at better protection of marine environment in the Mediterranean region by preventing pollution from ships. To this end, in January 2006 the SAFEMED project<a href="#defann_70_2" name="refann_70_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (€4,5 million financed under the MEDA<a href="#defann_70_3" name="refann_70_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) started in order to promote the achievement of the above objectives.</p>
<p>The proposed legislative action, along with the fact that the implementation of the above Strategies requires the cooperation of non-EU States, make this process extremely useful as platform for environmental cooperation at regional scale.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
