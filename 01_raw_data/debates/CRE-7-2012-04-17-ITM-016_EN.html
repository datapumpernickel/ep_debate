<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, we are all absolutely appalled by the horrendous levels of violence that have been witnessed in Syria. Regime forces have bombarded cities with no regard for civilians. Violence has not spared children. We all want, above everything, the violence and killings to stop, and everyone is extremely worried by the potential for further militarisation and escalation of the conflict. The increased violence that we saw leading up to the ceasefire deadline of 12 April was totally unacceptable, and reports about shelling in the city of Homs and civilians killed in Hama and Deraa are extremely disturbing. Violence has abated, but that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I urge in the strongest possible terms that the cessation of violence be for real, and that Kofi Annan’s plan be implemented immediately and in its entirety. The honourable Members will know how fragile and unstable the situation remains. The violence in Homs, Hana and Aleppo are tragic reminders of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will have seen that the UN Security Council adopted unanimously – and I emphasise that unanimity – on Saturday a resolution approving the immediate deployment of an advance team of up to 30 military observers to Syria to begin reporting on the implementation of a full cessation of armed violence. They left for Syria on Sunday and are now on the ground starting their work. It is an important development for the implementation of the UN and League of Arab States Special Envoy Kofi Annan’s six-point plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with our EU representatives at the UN Security Council, to whom I pay tribute for their work and for their engagement, and all our Member States, we have spared no effort to try and ensure that the international community speaks with one voice. I and my services have engaged in particular with Russia and China – last week on the margins of the G8 meeting in Washington – to seek their support and a change in their position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Security Council resolution presents, finally, a unified call from the international community to the regime, and I quote: ‘the urgent, comprehensive and immediate implementation by the Syrian Government of all the elements of the Envoy’s six-point proposal in their entirety’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a matter of choice. The six-point plan is not optional. The government has to implement it fully. Troops and heavy weapons have to be withdrawn from population centres, peaceful demonstrations and freedom of association must be respected, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting must be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Only through a credible and sustained halt to violence will Kofi Annan be able to develop a peaceful, inclusive and Syrian-led democratic transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians. We are watching very closely the situation on the ground. We have called on all parties to comply with his plan. Given the government’s responsibility and record of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments, this resolution is an opportunity for the regime to change course and cooperate fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Unanimous action is what we have been calling for from the beginning of this crisis, and now it is of utmost importance that the members of the Security Council continue to support Kofi Annan in his efforts and ensure that a fully-fledged observation mission in Syria is operationalised without delay. China and Russia must continue to play a key role in bringing a solution to the conflict, using all their influence to ensure the Security Council resolution is fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, on a number of occasions, personally expressed my support to Special Envoy Annan and told him and the Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, with whom I met yesterday, that the EU and the Member States stand ready to provide any required support to the observation mission. In our cooperation with the League of Arab States, we have already helped build the League of Arab States Situation Room to improve communications, and we are training them to develop their analysis and ability to respond to crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I convened the Crisis Platform again to bring together all the services of the EEAS and the Commission, under the chairmanship of Secretary-General Pierre Vimont. We are putting all our instruments together, coordinating closely with Kristalina Georgieva and her work and humanitarian aid and support, and reaching out to all the countries neighbouring Syria, both through ambassadors in Brussels and through the authorities on the ground. We are working closely with all the Member States to try and ensure an effective and coordinated EU response.</p>
<p class="contents">We have suspended all types of cooperation, including bilateral cooperation, and Syria’s participation in regional programmes. The European Investment Bank, with which we work closely, has suspended all its loan operations and technical assistance to Syria. We have nevertheless maintained aid that benefits the Syrian population, students, human rights defenders and the opposition. Those programmes with Syrian students and universities will continue. We are supporting efforts to deliver shelter, medical supplies, food and whatever is needed. We have put together a contribution of EUR 29 million in humanitarian aid to Syria and the neighbouring countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Support to the neighbouring countries is also essential. I discussed these issues when I was in Turkey over the weekend with Foreign Minister Davutoglu, who also joined the G8 Foreign Ministers by video link. The humanitarian and security situation on the Turkish border is critical, and the Turkish response has been excellent, with fast and professional support to the 25 000 refugees in its territory. I have offered our assistance on a number of occasions to Foreign Minister Davutoglu and did so again this weekend. I remain in close contact with him and his services for whatever is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working closely with Jordan and Lebanon and are ready to mobilise our instruments to respond to their requests. I have started to discuss the details of that support with the Foreign Minister of Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we continue to act as fast as we can, liaising closely with local ministries. Many of the displaced populations in neighbouring countries live not in camps but with families. That is why we are looking into broader and wider support, including assistance to host families and support to the regions and populations most directly affected by the inflow of Syrian citizens, particularly in the fields of health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, together with Commissioner Füle, I have proposed as a matter of urgency a Commission Special Measure to reserve EUR 23 million for funds to support specifically Syrian civil society, as well as refugees and affected populations in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides our assistance, I want to make it clear that we are ready to continue to impose sanctions and restrictive measures for as long as the repression continues. The last round of sanctions was approved at the Foreign Affairs Council of 23 March, and we are working on a new set of sanctions and restrictive measures. Today, my team is in Paris taking a leading role in the meeting of the working group on sanctions created at the Istanbul meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that our delegation remains open in Damascus for as long as the security situation permits. We need to have eyes and ears on the ground and to be close to the Syrian population. The Syrian people have asked us not to leave. We are hosting diplomats from Member States that have decided to suspend the activities of their own embassies. Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands now have diplomats within the EU delegation in Damascus.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say a word about engagement with Syrian opposition groups, which is a critical issue in which I believe the European Parliament has an important role to play. I thank Parliament for its efforts in reaching out to opposition groups. Our main objective remains to encourage all groups to put aside their differences, work together towards stronger coordination and agree on a way forward for an orderly transition that is both inclusive and democratic. They need to build a common vision for the future of Syria, where all Syrians from all backgrounds and affiliations are free and equal. I have instructed the External Action Service to continue its meetings with opposition groups and to reach out to minority groups to encourage them in this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of Syria belongs to the Syrian people. Their lives, their rights and their aspirations must be respected. We need to do as much as we possibly can, but it is now time for President Assad to match his words with deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill.</p>
<p class="contents">The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What came out of all of this? I am not sure that things are any clearer than at the start. In any case, all of the Syrians with whom we spoke were very afraid of what I will call a ‘proxy war’; in other words, a war fought vicariously between Sunnis, Shia, etc., with geopolitical interests being played out in Syria and with possible interventions by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. These people told us: ‘our revolution will be stolen from us’.</p>
<p class="contents">It really seems as though the Annan plan is the only way out in Syria, besides civil war. It is not very satisfactory, but that is the feeling being expressed there. The solution is the Annan plan, but an improved Annan plan, a viable Annan plan, an Annan plan that would provide for Assad’s exit from power in the short term. It is here, then, that more work needs to be done, and we discussed the implementation of the Annan plan at length with members of the Syrian opposition. However, they live in terrible fear of civil war and of the influence of Qatar, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise a second point very quickly. Refugees are a priority. They are a priority that we seem to consider humanitarian, but they are a political priority. Within Lebanon, they are a political priority. These are members of the Syrian opposition and they are up against Hezbollah. It is therefore crucial that we make them our political priority – I am concluding – and I would like to say to you, Baroness Ashton, that you are right to have kept a European Union embassy in Damascus; do as we did in Benghazi and put the European flag …</p>

I do not think that we still have an Annan plan or that the plan is working.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us face the facts. She did not talk about these. More than 100 breaches of the Annan plan have been identified in the last two days. More than 50 people were killed yesterday. I do not know how many casualties there have been today in Syria. So how can you talk about an Annan plan – an Annan plan that is not being applied in practice by Bashar al-Assad? Does the international community need several hundred more killings before everybody recognises that in fact, it is not working because Bashar al-Assad is not willing to apply it? I think all this is leading to an increased number of killings and deaths in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest idea is for us to put observers there, and the international community and the European Union are saying that we shall give every support. What does this support mean? To put in place 215 observers, you need to spend several thousand euro on military equipment to protect them. Otherwise, it is impossible. Mr Vimont is a specialist, maybe he can tell us. In a normal operation in Syria, with 215 observers on the ground, how many soldiers would you need? Why should we do it? To protect our observers, not to protect the Syrian people who are still under attack by Bashar al-Assad. I really do not think this is the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to observe – what in fact we know already – is that the plan is not working. Bashar al-Assad is killing more people. We know that Bashar al-Assad is ignoring his promises and is simply continuing with crimes against humanity. Is that what we need to know? We already know it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there is any time left now. What we need to do now is not to observe and to protect the observers but to act. We know what this means. It means three things: safe zones, humanitarian corridors and support for the Syrian opposition. If we can do this with the Security Council, let us do it with the Security Council. If it is not possible with the Security Council because of the position taken by Russia and China, we will do it without the Security Council. But the international community has an obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a last question. Can you give us some information on the recent incident with a German ship that is trying to deliver arms to Syria and that is directly breaching the arms embargo?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President – and I think I also speak for Ms De Keyser – problems as serious as the crisis in Syria are more important than you always putting your hammer down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the most important thing is to keep up the pressure, to offer observers helicopters and airplanes, and – as Ms De Keyser said – to support operationalisation, because so far, we have not seen the results that are really needed. We need to support the opposition both politically and logistically, and we cannot just leave it to others to support them selectively. I think that there is a risk that we will not see a building up of common ground, but I think that this could be our role.</p>
<p class="contents">On the humanitarian side, we need to make it clear that the rights of refugees need to be guaranteed. Shooting at refugees from any side is unacceptable. Having said that, it is also our duty to help and support refugees in the countries in which they arrive. We can and must do much more there.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me point out one really important issue: we need to act ourselves in order to end the bloodshed in Syria. We need to be serious about our own arms embargo, and there are two incidents that I want to mention. On 10 January 2012, the Cypriot authorities allowed a Russian ship carrying more than 59 tonnes of weapons destined for Assad to dock and refuel, despite clear evidence of its dangerous cargo. This is outrageous. Cyprus cannot buy a financial bail-out from Russia at the expense of the Syrian opposition. On 13 April 2012, a German ship sailing under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda was stopped on its way to Syria. The ship has now apparently changed its course, but – as of today – its exact whereabouts are unknown. This is unacceptable. The UN and its Member States have a duty to ensure that the arms embargo is respected. I have already sent you a priority written question on this, asking you to investigate the role of Cyprus in the aforementioned incident. So far, I have not heard back from you. As a matter of urgency, we therefore ask you in an open letter to investigate these incidents and also finally to develop a real monitoring and oversight mechanism of our embargo systems. I will now personally deliver this letter to you, and I look forward to your answer.</p>

However, I think that it is right, at the same time, for us to bear two things in mind and to put them in the balance. How many thousand dead must be put on one side of the scale before we accept that it balances a questionable democracy in the future; I do not think that there are many people here in this Chamber who believe that fifty thousand or more fatalities in Iraq balance the fact that Iraq now has what I referred to earlier: a questionable democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to support the view that no arms should be exported to Syria, regardless of by what method or what route, and we also need to support the Annan plan without accepting any infringements in respect of Syria. That is the only way we shall understand the clout that Syria has in the area. I do not agree with the stand that Syria or China should be disregarded. Whether we like it or not, members of the UN Security Council are acting out of geostrategic interests and what we should be interested in is the outcome. In other words, no more people should die in Syria. Precluding the facility for Syria to import arms, together with our insistence that the Annan plan be applied in full to Syria, is – I think – the only way to contain the situation and the bloodshed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is being played out in New York, with the West opposing Russia and China; the other is being played out on the ground between the Sunnis – backed by the Saudis and the Qataris – and the Shi’ites, who are supported by Iran, which backs the Assad regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the hypocrisy very disturbing indeed, and this also applies to our own Member States. There are those who are talking about a humanitarian corridor, but who are doing nothing to make it a reality. Such a step would require military security in the area of the humanitarian corridor, namely in Turkey. They are, of course, playing a game of political hypocrisy, and the aforementioned unacceptable breach of embargoes needs to be clarified by our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is crucial for the EU to support the Annan plan because it is the only game in town capable of preventing a prolonged civil war. At the same time, it should be very clear that we want Assad out of power and brought before the ICC. This is not in the Annan plan, but it should be made clear in the EU’s dealings. He and the others in his regime should be tried for the crimes they have committed against the people of Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that we support the Annan plan in any way we can, namely, in terms of providing security for the observers to perform – if they are indeed to perform. We also need to give support to the refugees – not only those in Turkey, but also those in countries like Lebanon, who are facing very difficult conditions, as well as the populations who are housing them. Finally, we need to engage with the Syrian opposition to make sure they unite on a democratic platform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As long as the members of the international community, and China and Russia in particular, fail to make it clear to President Assad that he must go, because there can be no lasting peace while he and his close circle of murderers are in power, then Assad will continue to slaughter his own people until he has nipped any form of resistance in the bud. We must be aware of this. Anyone who believes that it is possible to negotiate with Assad and his thugs is, unfortunately, deceiving themselves.</p>

As has been stated in this Chamber, more than 11 000 people have died, while tens of thousands of others have been injured, illegally arrested or forced to go into exile. Unfortunately, the external pressure and sanctions that have been applied have failed to deliver the desired results. Indeed, the breaches of the fragile ceasefire, which came into force last Thursday, highlight the fact that the Assad regime is not sincere in its undertakings to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, all the regime in Damascus has done until now is to make token gestures backed up by increasing repression. Although a consensus has not been reached on the Syrian crisis in the UN Security Council, there is a Council declaration from 21 March which supports the settlement plan of joint UN and Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan. I think that this plan, with its minimum requirements, proposing an end to the violence, the provision of humanitarian aid and the release of prisoners, must be complied with, especially when the UN observers are present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The use of heavy weapons by the Syrian army against government opponents has already claimed thousands of victims, especially from the civilian population. After repeated efforts by the UN Security Council to halt military operations, the Special Envoy, Kofi Annan, has managed to persuade the warring parties, the Syrian Government and opposition fighters, to accept a six-point peace plan enabling them to move towards a bloodless resolution to the conflict under UN auspices. The fragile truce that has been brought about recently is enabling members of the observer mission, who will monitor the observance of the ceasefire by the conflicting parties, to be deployed in critical parts of the country. However, I think that the halt in military operations must immediately be used to launch a real dialogue on the country’s political issues under the auspices of the United Nations. Otherwise, the temporary suspension of fighting will not bring peace and the peaceful reform of the social order, which we all surely would like to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Syria, for many years there has been government opposition demanding it and wanting changes in the Syrian political system. However, what we are seeing today is not a revolution, nor the military crushing of a peaceful popular uprising. What we are seeing today in Syria is a military conflict instigated, financed, armed and encouraged from the outside. What we are dealing with here is the arming, financing and training of mercenary forces and terrorists by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and, according to different sources, the United States and France as well.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, the passion and frustration that Members of this House feel is very obvious from all their contributions, and it is mirrored in every conversation I have with anyone who takes an interest in the plight of the Syrian people and the horror of what is happening to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make three particular points in closing this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it is very attractive, emotionally and intuitively, to think about safe havens, corridors and so on, but we have to recognise that the violence in Syria is taking place across 180 000 km<span class="sup">2</span>. It is not in isolated places; it is everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to recognise that the humanitarian organisations are very nervous about anything which would involve the military coming in in support of their work, and we have to respect and listen to the experience that they have. In addition to that, remember that putting boots on the ground is a huge thing, and to do so without the UN Security Council is extraordinarily challenging to say the least. So it is very important that we recognise, when we talk about these ideas, what it is we are actually describing. It does not mean I am asking the honourable Members to reject them, I am simply saying we need to understand what it is we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the United Nations does not have an arms embargo because they could not get agreement in the Security Council. We have an arms embargo, the United States has an arms embargo and we are asking for details. I am working with the governments of Cyprus and Germany, who are looking into this right now, and I will respond with any information that I might have.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are doing everything possible and working as closely as possible with everybody else to try and get the opposition groups to unite. In my last conversation with Kofi Annan, this was very much on his mind: how to bring them together through either an umbrella or collaboration around the table, in order that they could put aside their differences and come to a common view. I know that in Istanbul, this was one of the big issues. So we are continuing to engage with them and with our colleagues across the world to try and support that unity of opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is my view that at the moment, the Kofi Annan six-point plan is where we have to concentrate our energy. It is where we finally have a Security Council resolution we can all get behind and with which we can hold everybody to account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there are already significant problems in Syria with the plan and with the ceasefire. It is also clear that the observers are ready to start their work. We have to back them and to work as hard as we can to get all the six points implemented and to do what Kofi Annan has asked us for, which is to offer him our full support. He has mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am shocked by the extreme violence that we are seeing there, but also particularly disturbed by the turn that events have taken. We should welcome the fact that the United Nations is finally addressing the issue. Kofi Annan’s plan seems to me a reasonable road map, offering hope of an end to the crisis. However, it appears that Bashar al-Assad is only using it to buy time. The ceasefire to which he had committed lasted only a few hours before he started shelling several cities again. Yet we must acknowledge the important resolution voted for unanimously by the United Nations Security Council, which enabled military observers to be sent into Syria. Their task is proving difficult while there is a lack of initial political will in place to bring an end to the crisis. However, it is now the only hope for the gradual implementation of Kofi Annan’s plan. I would take this opportunity to welcome the European diplomatic action that has managed to persuade Russia and China not to use their veto again in the UN. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
