Only a few months ago, a joint resolution condemning the gross violation of human rights in that country was passed unanimously. Unfortunately, as is often the case when dealing with totalitarian regimes, the Burmese dictatorship took only minimal notice of that resolution. The brutality and repression practised by the Burmese military against their own people has continued unabated and serious human rights abuses, including rape and pillage by government soldiers, have continued to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an estimated 1 000 political prisoners are still being held illegally and, on 2 November, 10 prominent human rights democracy and peace activists were given a total of 756 years in sentences. Needless to say, their trials were totally unfair; they were denied representation by lawyers of their choice and prevented from having access to their families.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Burmese dictators leave us with no option but to proceed with a tougher resolution, such as the one before us today. Amongst other things, we call on the UN Security Council urgently to address the situation in Burma and we insist that the EU’s common policy on Burma be strengthened by taking certain practical punitive measures. The resolution also calls for a high-ranking EU envoy to be appointed to work towards securing the release of political prisoners, helping in humanitarian issues and generally assisting and bringing about the much-needed democratic reforms in that nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the Burmese dictators will, on this occasion, take more serious note of our condemnations and concerns and that they will proceed speedily along the only logical avenue open to them, which is the one that leads to the democratisation of their long-suffering country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was able to observe on the ground the efforts made by Laos and by other countries in the region to improve their mode of governance. The European Union supports, moreover, the efforts made by these countries, and work must continue along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma, for its part, is making no effort whatsoever in terms of establishing democratic rule. The repression suffered by, in particular, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and by her party’s supporters, requires no further mention. This repressive situation is one glaring example proving the lack of democracy in Burma. Let us not forget that the party in power took the country’s helm illicitly. It seems appropriate to me to state a few facts illustrating the tragic situation of this country and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to act as spokesman in this Chamber for Reporters without Borders and bring up the case of Win Tin, a 75-year-old journalist, who is in a critical state of health and who is still in prison when he ought to have been released for good behaviour. The list of oppressed people is obviously a very long one and, despite the 250 releases granted a few months ago – a move that should be welcomed – there remain around 1000 political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">For over ten years, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which is nothing more than a military junta, has controlled the various aspects of the country’s political and economic life. Human rights are completely lost sight of, access to education has become a privilege reserved for a tiny sector of society and freedom of expression is non-existent to the point where foreign journalists are put in prison. Any form of dissidence is forbidden. Consequently, members of the resistance, who are still active, are arrested in order to prevent them from undermining the ruling power. The situation is all the more serious because this country, which has a large number of ethnic groups, does not respect cultural diversity at all. Some ethnic groups are, moreover, enslaved.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these unmistakeable horrors, certain countries continue to trade with Burma. As a Member of the European Parliament, I call for a firmer stance to be adopted in the face of this unacceptable situation, as the sanctions that have been taken are too weak. In order to bring about some change in the current situation, I believe that it is vital to prevent trade in strategic sectors currently in the hands of the generals. It would be worthwhile to call on the commercial and industrial businesses established in Burma to set an example, so that Burma really develops into a democratic country. That is why I, of course, unreservedly support the resolution tabled by the six political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Military dictatorship continues to rule by force, despite recent ceasefire talks and agreements. Resistance is still being dealt with by brutal military response.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited the Thai-Burmese border two weeks ago for six days. I had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in Thailand that are overflowing with people who have fled from Burma’s Karen province and Karenni province. The human rights situation inside Burma within ethnic provinces is hugely concerning. The reality of war and military leaders acting with impunity results in repression and abuse: forced relocation of communities and destruction of villages, thousands of internally displaced people living in the forest, the rape of women and girls – many such incidents documented by human rights organisations, forced labour, the use of up to 60 000 child soldiers – I met two young 16-year-old defectors from the Burmese armies, and the random use of landmines by both sides littering the jungle to lethal effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The main focus of this resolution is to nudge the international community forward, to ensure that Burma is put on the UN Security Council agenda as soon as possible. The report by Vaclav Havel and Desmond Tutu makes a real, legal and valid case for bringing the Burma issue to the UN Security Council, and I support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution to the suffering and repression in Burma is not primarily about aid, although aid is required to relieve suffering. A lasting solution must be a political one. We need a real ceasefire. We need talks between the government the SPDC, the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups, with all groups having an equal level of participation. We need the release of all political prisoners, and we need to allow democracy to govern. I have no confidence that, without sustained international pressure at the highest possible level, Burma will make the positive transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I encourage the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to take a more proactive role in getting Burma on to the Security Council agenda, in particular Britain. It is somewhat ironic that it is the US that is taking the lead on this issue despite the historic links and relationship between Britain, Burma and its people. It takes 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council to sign a motion to put the issue on the agenda. We currently have eight. If the political will exists, a ninth can be found and persuaded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key problem was that the people from central Burma differed, in terms of languages and culture, from the people nearer the coast and that the indigenous peoples wanted maximum autonomy. This demand was not met; they were not even met halfway, and violent conflicts were the result, giving the army the opportunity to become even more powerful and independent, eventually seizing all the powers of the state and also a large proportion of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a strange kind of dictatorship that does not have any ideological goals that might make them more popular among certain sections of the population. Within this dictatorship, there is a continuing battle, whereby leaders are deposed and even imprisoned. Within the leading group, there are also conflicting economic interests in the extraction of minerals, in the felling of tropical rain forest and in the production of opium. The tactics used in respect of the democratic opposition are also variable.</p>
<p class="contents">The only time when free elections were allowed, the large majority had spoken out in favour of the opposition, and so the result was subsequently cancelled. A change in regime has appeared virtually impossible to date. For years, foreign companies sought financial gain from this dictatorship. Burma can provide cheap raw materials, because the people are kept more or less in slavery and nature and the environment are not protected. Under pressure from various international protest movements, those economic contacts have now been cut back considerably, but have not completely disappeared. Only continued and strengthened isolation can bring change in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the proposed resolution calls for a ban on any companies registered in the European Union investing in, or lending to, Burma. Only in that way can we help put a stop to the rape and pillaging by government troops, forced labour, forced house moves, the taking of political prisoners and the exclusion of citizens from the government in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How does this resolution get serious – because it is well past time that this House did get serious? I refer you to paragraph 1 and our request that the UN Security Council investigate sanctions against this regime. We in the EU took this decision some time ago, yet EU companies continue to play a full part, in particular in the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise. It is argued in the grubby world of realpolitik that implementing our own sanctions policy would leave a vacuum that would be only too happily filled by the Chinese. Perhaps. So it is appropriate and commensurate that sanctions be discussed and implemented at UN level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, global politics should not be used as an excuse for our own double standards. We must enforce our own policy not just against the Myanmar Oil and Gas Company, but also against the Myanmar Timber Company and Myanmar Post and Telecoms, and I regret that they do not appear in this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Diplomatic pressure has demonstrably not worked against this regime. Our application of economic pressure must be stepped up and we must work with the United Nations to bring this disgraceful situation to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another resolution will be added and I do not know what its effectiveness will be, because the Burmese people are suffering barbaric suppression of their rights through forced labour, prosecution of opponents, the enlistment of children, forced relocation and the extermination of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to all this, Myanmar has a prime position in the production and trafficking of drugs, while HIV is forging ahead and Myanmar has a terrible record in this sector. These are issues which certainly need to be addressed by the international community because, not only is the situation not improving, it is getting constantly worse. For these reasons, there is a need for the UN Security Council to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Aung San Suu Kyi, who has an international reputation and has been honoured with international distinctions, can unite the political parties and all the opposing political groups and guarantee the independence of ethnic minorities, so that at some point democratic, judicial and political change will come to Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">The report drafted recently at the initiative of President Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, which confirms with precise data the drastic situation in the country, posits this need for broader dialogue. The dialogue, apart from the internal level I mentioned, must also be held on an international scale. Consequently, I think that the European Commission should take an initiative towards the UN Security Council, so that a solution can be found for Myanmar to acquire a democratic future, although acute pressure must be exerted beforehand.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite our diplomatic efforts so far, none of the conditions set by the sixth ASEM Ministerial meeting in Ireland last year, including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi as a minimum condition, has been fulfilled by the Burmese dictatorship. While some political prisoners have been released, 1 000 remain in custody and political leaders continue to be sentenced to brutal prison sentences, some of up to 106 years. Forced labour continues, despite agreements with the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strengthen our diplomatic actions in relation to Burma by prohibiting investment or loans to all state-owned companies, not just those already banned.

Several years ago, this was more or less the reaction of one of my colleagues to the press report on the news of new natural gas deposits in the continental shelf of that South Asian country. Myanmar is currently subject to EU and UN sanctions. What is interesting is that in his report, which we have received, Sergio Vieira de Mello complains about the efforts of the military government to enshrine the role of the army in the newly drafted constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you have not misheard me; in 2005, one of the most fiercely criticised aspects of the situation in Myanmar is the role of the army in daily life and the imprisonment of hundreds of people on account of their political opinions. Yet if any of you were to think that we could be talking about Turkey or Afghanistan, you would be mistaken. Such things are criticised in Turkey as cautiously as though we were talking about the United States. In the case of Myanmar, we refer to the violence as intolerable, and the same is true for the treatment of ethic minorities. As far as Afghanistan is concerned, we are lost for words. Why not open accession talks with Myanmar and set up a free trade area and such like, as we are doing with Turkey? Is that pie in the sky? If so, then we are nothing but a bunch of impostors, applying different standards to different countries. Please do not take it amiss, but I shall not be voting for a resolution of this nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is familiar to us from images of exquisite Buddhist temples and gold-encrusted, sumptuous palaces. Yet the tragic fate facing thousands of the country’s citizens is being covered up. Human rights are brutally violated there, and thousands are either serving time in prison after having been sentenced and persecuted for opposition activities, or are subjected to forced labour. Children as young as 11 are forced to do military service, and the majority of citizens live on less than USD 1 per day. They also lack access to health care, which exacerbates the problems faced by the many people infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma has been rated 190th out of 191 countries with regard to the quality of access to health care in the country. There is no such thing as access to the Internet in Burma. Satellite dishes were banned until recently, and the country’s citizens are not allowed into the small number of hotels where foreigners have access to the foreign press.</p>
<p class="contents">All the state structures were dissolved after the <span class="italic">coups d’état</span> in 1962 and 1988, and power was seized by the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Ironically, the latter has been responsible for instituting one of the bloodiest regimes in the world. Even though a parliament was legally elected in 1990, it has not yet taken up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">The generals’ junta ignores the interventions of international organisations, whether they are undertaken by the UN or by human rights and labour organisations. There are many unanswered questions surrounding the existence of regimes and totalitarianism of this kind. The problems relate not only to the way in which power is exercised by psychopaths who exploit those weaker than themselves, but also to the difficulties involved in providing any kind of aid. The latter is an issue because the population of the country, which in any case suffers persecution and extreme poverty, is hit hardest by any embargo. The majority of economic aid provided goes into the regime’s pockets. The military junta in Burma/Myanmar uses 40% of its revenue to support or even expand its army, which is already sizeable even though the country is not at war with anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, foreign corporations should not invest in Burma/Myanmar, since such investment would effectively amount to tacit and material assistance for the army. Wherever a dictatorship exists, ways should be sought to provide help, to conduct negotiations and to cooperate with the opposition. This cooperation should take place both with members of the opposition living in the country and with those living abroad, since they will be most aware of the extent of the problem and of the most helpful forms of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling for Aung San Suu Kyi and the other opposition leaders to be released, for the National League for Democracy to be allowed to take up its work again and for humanitarian aid to be provided, thus preventing both religious persecution and the destruction of the Burmese nation and national minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danuta Hübner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission fully shares the concerns regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar, as expressed here today by honourable Members of the European Parliament. There is no doubt that several issues are of serious concern, in particular the proceedings of the so-called national roadmap, the human rights and forced labour situation and many more issues that have been mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, let me emphasise that the Commission continues to call for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders who remain in detention. In the past, the Commission maintained contacts with most of the Shan leaders who have now been sentenced, and it goes without saying that the conduct of these politically motivated trials was unacceptable according to democratic and legal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to urge the regime to engage in a real dialogue with all political actors, including the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups. We are convinced that only a transparent and constructive dialogue between legitimate stakeholders can lead to national reconciliation and a return to democracy. Probably, the regime will deliver on its roadmap. It will probably formally accomplish the National Convention later this year and organise a referendum on the draft Constitution in 2006. The result will certainly fall short of our expectations in terms of real democracy. It should nevertheless be considered a small step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma/Myanmar is partly isolated from the Western world and partly isolating itself. However, we must understand that the country continues to enjoy a comfort zone in the region, especially with regard to its neighbours. There is a degree of intra-ASEAN solidarity, despite the position of individual political leaders in ASEAN. I mention these issues because they illustrate the difficult background against which we operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any doubt, we must voice our concern for the people in the country. The EU is called upon to help the people of Burma/Myanmar. The Commission therefore strongly supports a significant increase in humanitarian aid and assistance. The Commission maintains that our common position generally reflects what should be done. We should continue voicing the Union’s criticism of members of the junta and policies pursued by the regime. This can be done only if we continue the agreed EU policy by keeping communication channels open and using high-level ASEM and EU-ASEAN meetings, or the margins of such meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">An update of the common position needs to be discussed with and agreed by all EU Member States, bearing in mind the possible positive or negative developments in the country, and reflecting our values and political interests. This would also apply if the EU were to nominate a special envoy.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, in October 2004, we strengthened the EU common position. We introduced a more comprehensive visa ban and prohibited support for international financing. Any further change in the common position – apart from the fact that we would need all the partners to agree – would need to ensure the legality of such a measure under international law and ensure that the people of Burma/Myanmar did not become the victims. The people of Burma/Myanmar should not pay twice: once for living under a repressive regime and twice as a result of the economic sanctions imposed by the West.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of whether the UN Security Council should discuss Burma. Most of us have seen the recent report, endorsed by Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The report concludes that the UN Security Council should deliberate on the Burma/Myanmar issue. However, we are all aware that it will prove very difficult to pass any resolution on this subject given the reluctance of some permanent members, notably China.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure honourable Members of Parliament that the Commission will continue its work on Burma/Myanmar, stepping up its assistance for people in need and, at the same time, pressing for democracy, human rights, the release of political detainees and for democratic reform and political transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the overarching goal of our dealings with Burma is the transition towards democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
