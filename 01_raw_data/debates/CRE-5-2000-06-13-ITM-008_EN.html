<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, with regard to tobacco, many wonder what business it is of the European Parliament, the European Commission or our Health Ministers. Tobacco is a natural stimulant. You are supposed to enjoy it and politicians should not spoil this enjoyment. But, Mr President, this is not how it is of course. Needless to say, the element of freedom of choice and personal responsibility should be retained. This is based on the premise that the decision is taken by an adult who knows all the facts, and therein lies the difficulty. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that smokers are ill-informed on the effects of using tobacco and that they do not give their environment sufficient consideration. <span class="italic">This</span> is our business. And rightly so!</p>
<p class="contents">With a directive of this kind, the health aspects will inevitably be the focus of attention. However, we are principally dealing with an internal market directive, which is why Article 95 of the Treaty has been taken as a legal basis. There is doubt about this within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and their rapporteur has expressed this hesitation quite openly to us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. This doubt is probably exacerbated by fact that the tobacco advertising directive case is now before the Court in Luxembourg. I, however, do not share this doubt at all. If it had been a public health directive, then other measures would have been proposed. Then, we would have discussed points of sale, smoking at work, smoking in public places, possibly minimum age, which I personally do not support in any case. We would certainly have mentioned the most effective policy against tobacco, namely a price policy. We only need to look at the British and Swedish examples to see that this policy works. </p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about here is the amalgamation and updating of three existing directives, two of which have already been assessed by the Court, where the legal basis was not commented on. This draft directive has far too little in common with the one currently under discussion in Luxembourg to warrant a fair comparison. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we need to harmonise the internal market for tobacco products as a matter of urgency. At the moment, we are entangled in national rules, which leads to barriers to trade and legal inequality among consumers. Harmonisation, therefore, will benefit industry and public health. For example, our discussions have led to the development of common testing methods and a positive list of additives, as is already in place in France, Germany and Belgium. I would have liked to propose a list of this kind myself, but I believe that, at the moment, there is too much uncertainty surrounding such a list, to warrant such a proposal. But the proposals made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection could mean that such a list could be a reality as early as 2004. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this test procedure will bring about more openness regarding ingredients and additives, as well as prescribe conditions for the import to, sale within and of course – logically – the export from the European Union. We, however, are keeping an open mind with regard to the problems which European industry could face in this respect, and so the committee has embraced the possibility of postponement until 2006. </p>
<p class="contents">We want to provide consumers with free choice based on more extensive information. The best means of communication is the packet itself. It has transpired that the current warnings which cover 4% of the front and back of the packet are completely ineffective and insultingly simplistic. First and foremost, the information is misleading. The terms ‘light’, ‘ultra light’, ‘low-tar’ and such like, are incorrect. But indicating the different tar, nicotine and probably carbon monoxide yields also creates a false illusion – and young women, in particular, fall into the trap that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others. This terminology should be withdrawn. </p>
<p class="contents">But in addition to this, we need more useful information, and this is what smokers want too. They know that smoking is not good for you but they know precious little else. I have tabled an amendment that tidies up the proposals made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection in this respect. The message on the packet should take up more space and should ideally be illustrated. How much space, you may ask? Well, enough space. According to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, it should take up 40% or 50%. I suggested 35% or 45% in a proposal which I re-submitted via my group. But in any case, messages should not take up less than 30% of space on the packets, which is the proportion currently specified in Poland. This is why, in my opinion, the 25% suggested by the European Commission is insufficient, although it is a huge step forward. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the delegates for their remarkable cooperation and I am also grateful to the European Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council. This is bound to result in better policy. Similarly, the dialogue with the health organisations and industry has been a positive step. This Parliament has freedom of choice too and can now use it. A choice between tinkering at the edges or taking forceful measures. I call on Parliament to display the courage it takes to go far, because this will be to everyone’s benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not about having some kind of hidebound discussion for legal experts, an exercise in legal hair splitting as it were, but concerns an eminently political issue, namely that of competences and the demarcation thereof. </p>
<p class="contents">Even a court of law does not simply apply law on its own in such cases. It creates and drafts law, and further develops it. As co-legislators, we would do well to take part in this drafting process. And we are doing just that in as much as we are performing this demarcation, this separating off, of our own accord.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Turning briefly to the points I would like to make: Article 152 of the Treaty expressly rules out approximation of laws in matters pertaining to health. This may be regrettable – I also have every sympathy as to why this should be so – but that is how matters stand. Article 95, the general clause on the internal market, as it were, serves as a legal basis as far as the strengthening of the internal market is concerned. And we should not complain if health issues are acknowledged as a matter of priority in this context.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Demarcation and assessment cannot be undertaken on the basis of headings, nor can it be done by drafting a directive of the kind that the Commission puts forward in a markedly mechanical and often completely disjointed manner. It cannot be accomplished in the way that it used to be either, particularly as the principle of subsidiarity has now been enshrined in the Treaties. It can only be done on the basis of the factual content of a proposal, and when it comes to amendments, on the basis of the factual content of these amendments. However, the decisive factor will not be whether it has any implications for the internal market. This will always be the case, which is why any attempt at demarcation would actually be pointless. All that ever matters is whether the main emphasis and aim of a directive serve to promote the internal market, to dismantle barriers to trade and to promote the free movement of goods, or whether the main emphasis is different. Indeed no one has so much as mentioned yet whether that is the main emphasis of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore on a final note, I urge you to reject the committee’s proposal, the directive in its present form – and I stress, in its present form, not in any form – on account of its lacking a legal basis and transgressing the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I have little to add to the points Mr Lechner made about the legal basis. Had the legal basis been correct then it would have been for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to handle this directive. The Commission has made no reference to this effect. The two obstacles to the internal market, i.e. different levels of taxation and derogations, in the case of Greece for example, remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the draft directive proposes a restriction on exports. As regards ingredients, the same values are to apply to exports from Europe to third countries as well. We consider that to be wrong and excessive and believe that this proposal should be dropped.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the following wording has been proposed for the health warnings: ‘smoking kills’. ‘Smoking can kill’. My committee takes the view that not only are such warnings misleading, they also discriminate against those who manufacture the legal luxury item or trade in it, particularly in view of the European Union’s highly ambivalent attitude in this respect. Total tax revenue from tobacco is EUR 70 billion in the Member States and tobacco cultivation is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 billion – none of this adds up.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as far as the size of the health warnings is concerned, we believe that the decisions taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are completely immoderate and so we reject them.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point relates to the designations ‘mild’ and ‘light’ which we believe are used predominantly to describe taste and colour alone, and should stay that way. Accordingly we propose that these designations continue to be modified.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point concerns the uniform measuring procedure, or rather, the Commission’s demand that comprehensive data be exacted from the companies themselves. In this connection, we recommend that a scientific committee, in conjunction with the ISO, develop uniform measuring and testing procedures to be introduced on a pan-European basis. It makes more sense to go down this route – even if industry has its doubts – than to go for the comprehensive compulsory registration proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that opinions will differ on this subject. I would advocate that we keep our heads and a sense of perspective on this issue, at first reading, so as not to jeopardise the jobs we so badly need in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, naive to assume that we will manage to banish smoking altogether. What matters most in our view is that we have a responsibility to make every effort to prevent people from taking up smoking at an increasingly young age. With this in mind, Member States could consider increasing cigarette prices and prohibiting the sale to children under the age of 16. I would like to make the following observations about the directive. With regard to the legal basis, I welcome the fact that the directive will now be put to the vote. The European Parliament has political responsibility in this respect, and we do not need to wait for legal procedures. This would be a first, we have never done this before and there is always something being drawn up somewhere. Moreover, the legal offices of the European Parliament and the European Commission have confirmed the correctness of the legal basis. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to touch upon health. First of all, I am in favour of excluding yields from the packets, which seems to have a misleading effect. Lower tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields are just as harmful to health and are, in fact, sometimes even more harmful. It is sufficient to indicate that these products are in the packets and that they are harmful to health. People should, however, be able to gain easy and free access to product information. Strangely, this proposal facilitates export for health organisations and industry alike, and has a positive effect on the votes. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to health warnings, Mr President, given the range of wishes regarding the warning size, I have now decided in favour of maintaining the percentages quoted by the European Commission, which can now be considered a compromise. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out the dangers of passive smoking. So far, these have been underestimated, but the serious effects are becoming increasingly clear. Other than that, I am of the view that warnings should be kept as brief and punchy as possible. Longer texts render the warnings less forceful. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to subsidies, I am in favour of phasing these out. It is not credible to discourage smoking on the one hand and to stimulate the cultivation of tobacco on the other. With regard to the market, Mr President, an open internal market entails developing equal starting positions for the industry in the different Member States. This is why I am in favour of scrapping the ban on snuff. This product is not healthy but not much worse than other products to warrant sole exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">As for export, Mr President, I am of the opinion that the same health requirements should apply to sales within and outside the EU. Concerning warnings, the rules of the importing countries could prevail. </p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the testing method, Mr President, it is important to arrive at a uniform testing method within the EU that has been established by an independent scientific body comprising experts from different related disciplines who would then be required to develop the testing methods. Each Member State should then appoint a competent laboratory, either on their own territory or not, as the case may be, and tests carried out in these recognised laboratories should then have to be recognised across all Member States. It would be a useless exercise if the same tests were to be carried out in all the Member States in accordance with uniform testing methods. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out the difference between cigarettes, pipes and cigars. Smoking is bad for the health and all tobacco products are bad, but there are distinctions between the different products. Everyone will agree that the target group of pipe and cigar smokers will be different to that of cigarette smokers. Hence my proposal to draw a distinction in the directive between pipe and cigar tobacco with regard to the size (a smaller percentage) and colour of the warnings (namely not black and white but also to allow contrasting colours). Cigar and pipe smokers are older, less frequent smokers in the main, and are mainly social smokers. The product concerned is also more expensive. If we mainly wish to discourage people from taking up smoking at a young age, this is not the target group. Hence the distinction drawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sacconi (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, on the eve of the vote on this motion, I would like to focus on the problems raised by this directive and stress the responsibility we have had to display in order to iron them out. Since the fight against smoking, which is the main cause of death in the Union, is the leading element in the fight to uphold of the right to health, it is important to be aware that this fight can only be won through dynamic but realistic consideration of the implications for production and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue that the balance achieved between these two elements of the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes up for the hard work of the last few months, and, in connection with this, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who joined us in taking a flexible approach to the matter and liasing openly with both the health associations and the producers of tobacco and tobacco products.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, briefly, to the contents of the draft, I would stress that the Commission’s proposal has not only been adhered to but also further consolidated in terms of public health protection. Indeed, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes to ban all terms such as light, ultralight or mild, since they are considered to be completely misleading for smokers, and eliminate any possibility of derogation for the States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee and my group have declared that they are in favour of harmonising the ingredients and additives of tobacco products, and have called upon the Commission to present a proposal for a list of authorised ingredients before the end of 2004. The rules governing warnings have also been consolidated: we were not content simply to increase the amount of space dedicated to warnings but the messages have been made clearer and more personal as well so that they will be more effective in dissuading consumers from smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, this reinforced line of health protection could not have been sustained if we had not found common ground with the requests for gradual phasing-out put forward by the tobacco and tobacco-related production industry. The most problematic aspect of this directive may well be, in fact, that it lays down the same shorter time frames and the same maximum contents for all cigarettes produced in the Union, whether they are intended for sale within the Union or for export. Nobody wants to deny the principle that cigarettes are bad for Europeans as well as for the citizens of third countries, but you cannot ask an entire sector to change overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to take into account the requirements of the tobacco producers and industry, we propose, in accordance with the outcome of the vote of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to introduce a new amendment, Amendment No 98, to uphold the position which keeps the objective of converting the sector to another activity unchanged but grants slightly longer time periods for this to be implemented, through the application of maximum content levels for internal production as of 2004 and for export as of 2006. In this way, we do genuinely frustrate the attempts of those who, in the name of production, even reject the requirement to introduce maximum levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. And that is what counts.</p>
<p class="contents">Another delicate point is the granting of the derogation to Greece to allow it to continue to produce strong cigarettes up until 2006. In this context, having discussed the matter at great length in the Group, we considered that we should keep the situation as it is: that is, keep the derogation for Greece and refuse to extend it to nicotine and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that all the work put in during these last months has been carried out in close cooperation with the Council working party, and inform you that the Portuguese Presidency has placed the adoption of this directive high on the agenda of the ‘Health’ Council to take place on 29 June.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the point of a major achievement – forgive me, Mr Langen – because in voting for the Maaten report and rejecting the amendments which challenge the validity of the legal basis of the directive, we have the chance to make our contribution to a more general anti-smoking strategy and, thus, to the improvement of our health.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nicotine is an extremely addictive drug. The best thing about it is that it is not particularly dangerous to human beings. The big question is that of how it is absorbed into the body. When it is smoked, for example in the form of cigarettes, large quantities of tar and carbon monoxide are also inhaled, which is extremely harmful. What is more, cigarettes give off smoke, which is of course the whole point of them, and this smoke spreads to the environment. As a result, the nicotine is not only inhaled by the person who uses it and wants it in their body, but it also enters the environment, something which is extremely harmful. </p>
<p class="contents">The gist of this argument is that we must try to restrict the use of cigarettes as much as possible, including of course the use of nicotine. We must reduce the levels of the harmful substances. We must warn people so that they smoke less and, perhaps most important of all, we must warn young people so that they never take up smoking. </p>
<p class="contents">One point I think is important in this report is that we should treat tobacco products for export in the same way as those for domestic consumption. There is no difference between people in different parts of the world. It is therefore equally important, where other people too are concerned, to reduce the quantity of harmful cigarettes as far as possible. It is also the World Trade Organisation’s view that no distinction should be made in this connection. In the name of future world trade, everything ought to be included. This should be a fundamental principle. The date from which this is to apply is debatable, but that issue is really of lesser importance. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words about Swedish snuff. If, now, we had begun a discussion as to the way in which we were to permit the use of nicotine in the European Union and had, for example, three alternatives – cigarettes, cigars and snuff – we should certainly have had no trouble reaching the view that it was snuff which should be permitted, possibly cigars as well but definitely not cigarettes. It is not, of course, nicotine in itself which is so dangerous, and taking snuff does not have much effect upon the environment. It should therefore be simple to conclude that we should authorise snuff throughout the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I personally have great respect, however, for the inhabitants of other countries who do not wish to introduce a new manifestation of nicotine into their Member States, and I believe it is important that they get to keep the restrictions in force. Sweden’s experience of a restrictive drug policy has been extremely positive, and I should like to extend this policy further within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is just one figure to remember and keep in mind throughout the debate and, particularly, during the voting: 500 000 deaths per annum within the European Community are due to tobacco, which is to say, more than AIDS, tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. And if we were to issue a directive on the social costs or on public health, then it would have to be a discussion about simply banning this fatal poison outright.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, however, the case. Here we are presented with a directive intended to facilitate the free movement of goods throughout the European Union by approximating Member State laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. We must therefore concern ourselves not with prohibition but with establishing the same conditions for consumer information throughout all of the European Union regarding the content but also the potential risks they run in consuming these products.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular we must give thought to young people who do not have the necessary objectivity, and have only the image of young men and women smokers, and not the viewpoint that I was able to gain as a doctor on a respiratory medicine or cancer ward where I saw smokers dying in great pain from lung cancer. This is not the future we want for our own children. Let us also give a thought to other people’s future. From this point of view, we must be pleased with Mr Maaten’s report and the amendments voted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which improve the proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">All these provisions, however, still fall short of what is necessary in the way of consumer information, and too often the determination to reach a compromise has prevailed. We must not let the text be distorted by amendments direct from the headquarters of the tobacco industry. We must remain vigilant as to the content, size and presentation of these warnings, which must not be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Several contentious issues still remain. The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions. The difficulty of measuring values or the fact that these products are not targeted at young people must not be used as an excuse for forgetting that these products, such as cigars, rolling tobacco or snuff, are harmful and must be labelled as such, especially since some, like the cigar or the pipe, may occasionally prove more attractive to young people. The maximum tar content of 10 mg is still excessive and does not take into consideration the real amount actually inhaled and the habits acquired. Tar content must be limited still further.</p>
<p class="contents">More worrying is the fact that the Technical Committee set up includes specialists from the tobacco industry. How is this body supposed to be neutral when it includes so-called experts that have spent their time deceiving public opinion, now supposed to become impartial judges of the harmfulness and toxicity of the products sold by their own employers? I feel that one would have to be extremely naive, and not, one hopes, just corrupt, to believe that such a body might be truly objective. Especially since these consultants to the industry are prepared to allow the introduction of ingredients not only to increase consumption but also to increase habituation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, confronted with 500 000 deaths annually, confronted with the money spent by the tobacco lobbies, infiltrating even this House, we must, ladies and gentlemen, make a choice in favour of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group shares the concerns about the harmful effects of tobacco and, apart from a few reservations, generally approves the Commission’s proposals, together with many of the amendments in Mr Μaaten’s report, although I do not know how effective they will be, especially those which go over the top, as other members have pointed out. Be that as it may, we shall vote in favour of most of them, together with those approved by other jointly responsible parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a number of proposals and amendments which either have no bearing on the matter or which will cause serious economic problems without solving the problems which they are supposedly addressing. The problem has been raised, albeit indirectly, of reducing and abolishing production aids for tobacco. Clearly such a move will not help to reduce smoking because I have not seen any of the members on their high horses proposing a ban on tobacco imports and such a move would therefore merely promote tobacco production in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the proposals which say that money saved by abolishing subsidies will be put to certain uses, the members making these proposals obviously have no idea how the budget works. Ex ante commitments are worthless unless they constitute actual policy worked out by the relevant bodies, rather than just a statement made in a parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment abolishes the derogation previously granted to the Greek tobacco industry for nicotine, tar and other yields. In other words, it will upset the investment and production plans based on our decisions, based on the deadline previously granted. And it will upset them retroactively. What sort of law school did the people who approve such arbitrary reversals attend? I should be most interested to hear the Commission’s comments on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, industry is required to apply the same specifications to export products as it is to those marketed in the European Union, even if the importing countries require no such thing. This measure is presented from a moral standpoint, which, however, does not prevent tobacco industries from moving outside the European Union and exporting their products throughout the world from third countries. Multinationals are already doing just that. Obviously, the rest will follow, with huge repercussions on economic activity and employment within the European Union. Of course, the European Union could try – quite rightly – to impose its specifications on candidate and other countries with which it has close ties, perhaps even on the World Trade Organisation. But instead of focusing on serious matters, we prefer a simple, or rather a highly simplistic and ineffectual solution. I assume that the Commission, which has conducted a more in-depth analysis, will be able to enlighten us further so that, at the end of the day, we opt for a more balanced, more effective and more logical way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the European Union sincerely believes that it can protect public health by covering cigarette packets with increasingly larger labels advertising the fact that “smoking kills” or “smoking causes cancer”, we are surely in the realm of the absurd. Is harmonising these warnings a credible step when these toxic products are free to be distributed throughout the European Union, with the authorisation of the Union? So let us leave the national states to deal with tobacco, with their own structures and their own cultural messages; let us leave them to engage in their own discussions with producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I refuse to believe that, in harmonising the warnings and labels, the European Union simply wishes to act for the common good. I reject the idea that European citizens should feel reassured in a tobacconist’s in Lisbon or Paris, simply because the Europeanised, standardised product they will recognise there will be familiar to them. As we all know, warnings serve no purpose, whether or not they are written in ‘Helvetica’ typeface. Surely our duty is rather to increase consumers’ responsibility rather than to make children of them by telling them what is good or bad for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if smokers have freedom of choice, we still have a duty to take preventative action, mainly with regard to younger generations. We therefore support the amendments prioritising the protection of public health, particularly those prohibiting product descriptions for, whether it is “light”, “ultralight” or “mild”, tobacco, in the form of cigarettes, cigars or snuff tobacco, seriously damages one’s health. Doctors in respiratory medicine, no doubt, but cardiologists too, are well aware of the fact, which they can observe every day, that tobacco is extremely harmful to health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
