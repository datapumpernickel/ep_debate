<p class="contents">Between 1998 and 2000, production surged disproportionately, with an increase of 20 million head of pigs, reaching an annual total of 205 million pigs slaughtered in the European Union. This was accompanied by a 30% collapse in prices with its trail of consequences, which some producers, especially the young and those heavily in debt, often could not withstand. Having been made bankrupt, some breeders had no option but to change social status by becoming mere employees of cooperative or private farms, whilst continuing to work on their former holdings. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that is not the interpretation of the European agricultural model that the European Union wishes to project internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, in the light of the objectives contained in Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75, as amended, one conclusion has emerged, and that is that the tools of the pigmeat sector COM, including private storage aid and export refunds, are unsuitable and inadequate. We have private storage aid, which is of less interest to operators now that it is being implemented in the context of a structural crisis, and export refunds, which are always useful, but which are dependent on international agreements which impose increasingly stringent restrictions. It is necessary, therefore, to come up with new instruments to guard against a serious crisis re-emerging despite a high level of internal consumption and good use of export opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing improvement of the productivity of pig producers is already generating a growth in supply and if this were to be accompanied by the unlimited extension of the apparatus of production, it would inevitably result, once again, in a serious imbalance in the market. The last crisis has taught us that the markets are now much slower to recover as, for the most part, specialised breeders maintain their overall production while waiting for better days to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, under these conditions, the problem concerns less the future of production than the future of producers. That is why it is imperative that the European Union is equipped with flexible instruments to prevent and manage crises in the pig industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission has proposed incorporating a new tool into the COM: regulatory funds. The idea is a good one, certainly, but, as its application is optional for Member States and producers and it does not provide any suitable solutions for breeders in a period of crisis in return for the freeze on output it demands, it is of little interest. In its present form, it would most probably be ineffectual.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, fully aware of the extent of the problem, on the basis of my report the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development introduced amendments to make this proposal more attractive and more effective. These amendments introduce measures intended to make it possible to draw up reliable forecasts for the market based on thorough assessment of the means of production; to establish regulatory funds in all Member States, supported by Community<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>aid, so that any pig producer in the European Union, whether breeder or fattener, who wants to join can do so in return for a commitment to stabilise output for five years; to establish conditions for the cofinancing of these funds by producers or their producer associations and by the European Union in order to encourage producers to join; to adjust the aid payments from these funds during periods of crisis and finally, to commit Member States to adopting, together with the Commission, the measures which appear to them to be best suited to restoring the balance of the markets in the event of a crisis. This effort to firm up the market must take into account developments in production in each Member State and must have a bearing on producers who do not join the regulatory funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We are convinced that these measures are such as to prevent crises in the pig industry, or indeed to manage them if by any chance they were to recur. By using instruments which are flexible, complementary and hence indissociable, and at a reasonable cost for the European Union, we should accept the fact that we can make the future less problematic for our producers.</p>

The report, which basically makes provision for a compensation fund for pigfarmers, and hence goes beyond the Commission proposal, was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I moved on behalf of our group for a split vote, as I personally reject the idea of a compensation fund for pigfarmers. I am quite happy to say yes to a piggy bank for pigfarmers, but I say ‘no’ to a compensation fund for pigfarmers, especially to a compensation fund co-financed from European money.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that we do not need any more regulations or state intervention. The whole point of the free market is that supply and demand even out at a specific price. It is true that pigfarmers have been hit by an historic slump in prices. But it was preceded by a period of economic stability. A relatively limited supply, as the result of swine fever and the BSE debate and high exports to third countries have benefited prices and our farmers are again demanding that politics should keep out of it as far as possible. This is again a good starting point for proving it. To my mind, this is no time for hysteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Every self-respecting agricultural textbook talks of two classical pig cycles. What we have seen over the last three years, albeit more drastically, is part of the classical pig cycle. The pigmeat market is now one of the few agricultural markets which is still basically free from state intervention. And the pigfarmers in my country are delighted at the fact. Setting up a compensation fund will quicken the concentration of European slaughter pig production considerably because the risk of bigger capital investments will shift to the common fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the fact that totally disparate agricultural philosophies apply in Europe; the philosophy of the federal system in Germany is quite different from that of the centralistic system in France. I am quite against the idea of co-financing by the EU. I am against any increase in state intervention. As for European regulations – as many as are needed, but as few as possible. What will we think up if there are any more agricultural risks, for example in the poultry sector? We cannot stuff money into a new EU piggy bank every time. That would indeed be the thin end of the wedge. Instead, it makes more sense if every pigfarmer sets up his own reserve, i.e. if every pigfarmer has his own piggy bank. That is what I should like to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the European Union is subject to cyclical movements, with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet. The periods of crisis are becoming worse and worse. The last one caused prices to fall by over 30% from mid-1998 to early 2000. The result is the disappearance of family holdings, whose only solution is to close down or to move into what is known as integrated production, in other words production in which the producers lose their independence as farmers and join a business structure – such as distribution chains or supermarkets – which dictates production plans to them in exchange for a certain economic stability. We have sometimes even wondered to what extent the cyclical market crisis itself may not be caused by the speculative action of these business structures, which thus gradually take control of the sector for their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts that the only two ways to support the market – private storage and refunds – are insufficient to stave off the crisis, and yet it makes this timid and ineffectual proposal. Its lack of imagination and lack of ambition are amazing. Rather than a measure to guarantee producers’ incomes when prices collapse, it is more like a paternalistic piece of advice: save up in times of plenty so you can get by in times of shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">What the proposal calls a regulatory mechanism consists of authorising a Member State that so wishes to establish a fund financed by those producers who join it on a voluntary basis for a minimum of five years, on the undertaking that they do not increase their stock. The contribution from the Community budget is nil, and the Commission confines itself to authorising the levy thresholds and the fund payments from within the management committee. The voluntary nature of the system means that the task of controlling production will be borne by only a few while the rest nullify this effect by producing without limit until the next crisis arrives. For all these reasons the Commission’s proposal is disappointing and we believe it is unacceptable. It does not solve the cyclical instability of the sector, it breaches the principle that the CAP will provide financial support and it is clearly an example of renationalisation and distortion of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence we back the report by our Socialist coordinator, Mr Georges Garot, and the amendments approved in the Committee on Agriculture. These turn the proposal into something very different by introducing, first, the compulsory nature of this measure for the Member States; secondly, Community cofinancing of the fund and the contribution of degressive launching aid; thirdly, Commission participation in crisis management measures; and fourthly, a broadening of the scope of this measure to cover piglet producers and closed-cycle holdings. Reference is also made to the need to encourage producer organisations, the prevalence of which varies greatly from one Member State to another.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Socialists the amendments approved by the Committee on Agriculture provide an acceptable framework for the establishment of the proposed funds, and therefore if the Commission is not willing to accept these amendments, we ask it to withdraw its proposal, which in its present form has been rejected both by ourselves and by the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that there has been a crisis in the pigfarming sector but I do not agree with Mr Garot’s proposal as to how future crises might be solved. The fact is that the pigfarming sector has been the only sector which has until now been able to compete on market conditions with just a relatively few forms of intervention such as export subsidies and private storage, and it must continue to do so. If subsidised by the EU, the regulatory fund proposed in Mr Garot’s report may well be of short-term benefit to small producers and help keep them artificially alive at the expense of larger and more productive producers who are, of course, the future for pigmeat production here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The extra EU subsidy proposed in Mr Garot’s report would, in my view, be quite unreasonable in a year such as this when, with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, we are to reform agricultural policy. We are not going to do this by inventing new aid schemes. Nor, moreover, is there any money in the Budget for this. I should like to have a statement from the Commission on the extent to which this proposal is in keeping with the trade agreements with the WTO and with Agenda 2000. In my view, it is in direct contravention of the common agricultural policy to establish national funds which will lead to unequal competition for European pigmeat producers. What is perhaps worse, however, is that it may contribute to a renationalisation of agricultural policy. I would therefore urge you to vote against both Mr Garot’s report and the Commission’s proposal so that the liberal policy which has so far prevailed in the pigmeat sector can continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My congratulations to the rapporteur. If every common organisation of the market were as anti-cyclical as what Mr Garot has proposed, or if all organisations of the market were to work in favour of smaller holdings, as Mr Busk has just said, then holdings in Europe would be structured very differently. The way in which the organisations of the market have worked in the past has served rather than impeded the concentration process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to see how the tables have turned. Those who, like me, tend to oppose the organisation of the market in the usual sense, support this proposed amendment. Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, who has fought tooth and nail to prevent other organisations of the market from being withdrawn or to get co-financing for them, now says there should be no co-financing here. If we were to apply the co-financing estimated here, i.e. 50%, to the other organisations of the market, for example in sugar, where the PPE is vehemently opposed to any change, that would instantly free up huge resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Busk is worried that the WTO would be unable to accept this, but he takes a quite different view when it comes to the organisation of the market in sugar which, if you please, we must defend against the WTO. This is a model just like the American model. We are introducing an insurance system and can easily demonstrate that social aspects play a part. I really do think that what the rapporteur has done here is a brilliant achievement; it shows just what you can do with administration when you set your sights on a specific objective and the objective is clearly specified here. Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, this objective does not suit you. Then you should say so and we can argue it out. This objective suits me fine and, as I say, if we had applied it in other organisations of the market, we would have a very different structure today.</p>
<p class="contents">As for co-financing and European contributions: the Commission has suggested adding an insurance system to the current organisation of the market, but only using money from the holdings themselves. I mean, what sort of a proposal is that? It is certainly no good to us. That leaves the other system and that is no good either because it fostered concentration. If we are going to do anything, then it must be as Mr Garot has proposed. He has turned the Commission's pathetic proposal into a reasonable, anti-cyclical, structure-securing proposal, which is why our group will vote in favour of this proposal and I trust that it will secure a majority tomorrow. I am just curious, Mr Garot, to see what the decision-makers in the Council will make of it. I personally do not think that it stands a chance. It is because its objective is designed as I have just described that it will most probably be swept straight off the table, unless the French presidency has something up its sleeve which it can use as a sweetener. And after that, it will probably be a first class funeral, but at least it will have been interesting!</p>

For a long time this has not been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has been resisted and rejected. Some of the demands go beyond the report because there is much which is out of kilter in the beef and pigmeat sectors. The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto. The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it. Slaughter cattle are being driven right across Europe, animal stocks are being cut back in return for state subsidies and huge ecological installations are being built. Nor does this report offer any ready solutions; too much else needs to be done for that. But the report does try to bundle production by applying the principle of voluntary action and by forming producer groups. This is an honest and credible endeavour and I shall recommend that my group vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, at a time when food safety is more than ever on the agenda and, above all, at a time when the entire meat industry in Europe is affected by mad cow disease, it is especially important that the reform of the COM in pigmeat is adopted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The market in pigmeat is subject to cyclical fluctuations with which economists are familiar, but the duration and the extent of the 1998/1999 crisis was unprecedented and highlighted the way this phenomenon is being amplified. Each crisis that occurs bankrupts countless family farms and pushes the industry more and more in the direction of concentration and integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the current, extremely flimsy mechanisms of the COM in pigmeat and the need for a regulatory mechanism that will enable producers’ incomes to be stabilised by a system of levies to be collected during periods when the economic situation is good and a system of payments to be made in times of recession, as the European Commission finally proposed along the lines of the French <span class="italic">stabi-porc</span> system. But this proposal would be totally inadequate if it was possible for Member States to reject these regulatory systems and if the reserves used to maintain revenues in a period of crisis were drawn solely from producer contributions, as this would lead to a two-speed production in pigmeat.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the largest producers, or those integrated with processing industries downstream, would distance themselves from this measure, preferring the systems they already have: individual savings; bank loans and redistribution funds. They would not have to commit themselves to limiting output and would retain their right to expand. They would hence be the very source of the next overproduction crisis which would inevitable lead to the bankruptcy of the regulatory funds.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the more modest producers, family farms, would play the game of solidarity, accept to limit their output and contribute to a national regulatory fund which would drive them into bankruptcy when the next overproduction crisis occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The current COM in pigmeat is extremely flimsy and much too hesitant. This planned reform is the first remotely significant reform that the Commission has proposed since 1975. The amendments introduced by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the instigation of Georges Garot, whom I must congratulate on his work, transforms this limited text into a wide-ranging one. The changes made by the committee are major indeed. The participation of all Member States in this new system will be compulsory. Producers from all over the European Union will be able to subscribe to this measure. The participation of the Community budget is also essential since, without it, those joining one of these regulatory funds would simply be faced with constraints and the system would not be attractive at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts cannot be made by producers alone. That is why our rapporteur proposes that the European Union should make a greater commitment by co-financing the regulatory funds. In this way, far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice, with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving, at reasonable cost, towards what is practised in certain third countries, such as the insurance-cum-income systems in force in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the proposal by the Commission, as profoundly amended by the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and will be voting in favour of the Garot report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This fund may be just the instrument to reduce pigfarmers' losses in times of crisis. The pig crises in 1998 and 1999 demonstrate the inadequacy of instruments such as private stocking and the export refunds of the common organisation of the market in pigmeat at the time. I think that, if we are to avoid and manage such crises in the future, this proposal is the first way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental point which the Commission has overlooked in its proposal is joint financing. In my view, the basic principle of EU financing should apply to common organisations of the market, including the common organisation of the market in pigmeat. It guarantees intensive participation on the part of farmers, thereby indirectly restricting production.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal makes provision for the fund to be set up by the Member States. We must, I think, ensure that all Member States set up the fund, so that farmers throughout Europe have an equal chance to participate in it. As far as the management of the fund is concerned, state administration should be kept to a minimum; in other words, the Member States should approve and monitor the fund but should not administer it; that should be left to the producer groups. Every farmer should be free to participate in the compensation fund., but if they decide to participate, they must sign up for five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am positive that this instrument will improve the stability of the market and allow farmers in Europe to manage cyclical crises more efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim to balance production and marketing beforehand will be of benefit to the production chain and to everyone else as well. I would like to point out, however, that at this stage we should not be embarking on a regulated economy in the pig industry. I agree very strongly with my colleague, Mr Busk, when he says that eastward enlargement lies ahead of us and, in a situation such as this, where we will have to take a serious look at the whole agricultural policy a few years from now, it is not, in my opinion, worth embarking on a regulatory mechanism for just one sector. That would not be the wise thing to do at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In this the south and the north are quite clearly opposed. In the south people are more in favour of co-financing. On the other hand, the pig industry in the north works on the principle that it should be very firmly undertaken on a voluntary basis, on which schemes may be created, schemes which – as Mrs Schierhuber said here just now – pig farmers could join in different parts of Europe. The Community could be providing funds in a mainly technical sense, financing technical matters in connection with start-up, and thus supporting actual start-up. The way I understand it is that voluntary funds in the future will help to ensure there is also balanced marketing in the pig industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report. It is the first time we have had a constructive debate on the problems that face the pig industry throughout the European Union – certainly in the eleven years I have been in this Parliament. I am not saying it is right, I am not saying I agree with it, but at least it is the first time we have had a constructive debate on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that pig farmers, regardless of where you come from, have faced the most difficult period possible. I have seen family farms go out of business; I have listened to farmers' wives wondering how they would survive because of the problems the industry was facing. The question I have to ask myself is very straightforward and simple: will this proposal help to alleviate their difficulty either in the short- or long-term? I have extremely serious reservations as to whether it can help the pig farmer in either the short term or long term. Co-financing is one aspect, but I have a horrible suspicion that would perhaps create an uneven playing field in many countries throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask the Commissioner – because this is the one thing that might be useful for some of us – whether this proposal will be mandatory on the Member States? If it is implemented in every Member State then there is a degree of fairness. If it is not implemented throughout every Member State, then there will be unfairness. There will be the suspicion that producers in another Member State have an unfair advantage. Can the Commissioner answer that? Whether I will vote for or against depends on how he answers that.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfair competition must be avoided at all costs. Pigs have always had – as has been said by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert – tremendous highs and lows in price. When the price has been high the producer has been doing well. When the price has been low then the family is not doing well. It is a question of balance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the problem in the pig industry at the moment. Is the Commissioner going to address the same problem in the poultry industry, in mushrooms, in tomatoes, in other industries that will have some particular difficulty at some stage in the future? That is what we have to ask ourselves: can the common agricultural policy really cope with the challenges it faces at the present time?</p>
<p class="contents">While the policy is good, and while I pay tribute to it, we have to go back to the drawing board. We have to look at it again. We have to have further consultation and greater cooperation to find a way in which we can come forward with a proposal rather than asking the hard-pressed producers at the moment to pay for something that they cannot afford. Let us look at how we can best support the industry in the longer-term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So this will prove to be a memorable evening, particularly where the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is concerned. I fully understand why people want market organisation for intensive livestock farming, and why they should want to scrap agricultural policy for land-based production. This is precisely the form of agriculture we have recognised as being the most sustainable and environmentally friendly form of agriculture for the future. This is noteworthy in itself. We will certainly revisit this theme in future discussions with the Green Group.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Garot, on the fact that he has done his utmost to see if he can do something to help at a time when pig farming is lapsing into crisis. That alone is worth a compliment. Secondly, is the medicine he prescribes the right medicine? I have grave doubts about that. To be perfectly honest, I do not believe in his particular brand of medicine, and I will tell you for why. I believe that market organisation only works if you talk in terms of co-financing, and European financing, and if agreements are reached regarding the volumes produced. Otherwise, there is every risk that whilst the market or revenue will indeed level off, this will mainly occur in a downward spiral, which cannot be the object of the exercise. That being the case, my preference is to have a free market for pig farming, where the market ultimately determines price trends. If, however, we opt for market organisation, and reinforcement of the associated policy, then we would do well, in my view, to see that the producer groupings are better equipped, so that they occupy a stronger position in the market; a market which is becoming increasingly close-knit on the demand side, and which is gaining in influence. You may ask yourself to what extent agriculture and horticulture in Europe can find an effective solution to this. I would sooner strengthen groupings, specifically with a view to gaining a better market position and making better agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore bound to say that I have reached a different conclusion to that of Mr Garot, and whilst I am almost inclined to say that I could almost go along with the Commission proposal in its present form, since we also have a duty to be honest, I feel that, basically, it does not actually do anything to address the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that is the approach I would go for; once again, although I reject the medicine prescribed by Mr Garot, I have the greatest admiration for all the trouble he has taken to explore the possibility of introducing more social support into the pig farming sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crises in the pig sector which, thank God, we have since overcome, were in fact what prompted the Commission proposal in the first place. Luckily we are currently in the buoyant phase of the pig cycle, meaning that supply has fallen and farmers are commanding much better prices. Farmgate prices have been hovering around EUR 140-150 per 100 kilos for several months and experts continue to see a positive outlook. It is clear from market developments that, as ever, the pig cycle is exerting its influence and still applies and that good times will again follow bad. We must not overlook this fact during our debate of today's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing is an instrument to support farmers' incomes in times of crisis. We are not discussing a new common organisation of the market in pigmeat. We have a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and we should not make the mistake of questioning the present common organisation of the market in pigmeat which, basically, works.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, in examining the amendments proposed in the report, to concentrate on the points which clearly differ from the Commission proposal. The first is co-financing. Without doubt, this is, to an extent, the key question in the debate on this proposal and it is addressed in proposed Amendments Nos 11 and 12. I should stress here that the main responsibility for a balanced market and for the resultant price levels lies in the hands of the pigfarmers themselves. It is they, the pigfarmers, who decide on production volumes and, hence, indirectly and automatically on future price developments. I think it would therefore be wrong to deny farmers their responsibility. Apart from that, co-financing carries the risk of distorting the market's signals to the farmers. I cannot therefore support the idea of putting all the market's eggs in an anti-cyclical price policy basket. If we start an anti-cyclical price policy, then all we are doing is jacking up the pig cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I have learned today is that there appear to be members who support the idea of introducing co-financing in all common organisations of the market. In other words, if we do it everywhere else, we will probably include the pigmeat market. But that is not the subject of the debate, at least not as far as I am aware.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important question is the voluntary basis for the system. The Commission proposal gives Member States the choice of whether or not they wish to set up a fund, whereas the proposed amendment makes it compulsory for all Member States. But we must not forget that European pigfarming varies and is organised differently from one country to another and that cooperation between the individual stages of the production chain is organised very differently. As a result, there is a whole series of Member States, and of pigfarmers in those Member States, who will brook no discussion of a compensation fund because they say that they do not need it because they have other arrangements for coping with recessions in their income cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Other countries are determined to have a compensation fund and I will tell you quite frankly that, if we were to propose a mandatory compensation fund, we might as well forget the whole idea, because it would never obtain a majority in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system, as stated in proposed Amendments Nos 7 and 13. I think this is asking for trouble because a) breeding is a very varied operation and b) support for breeders will not necessarily automatically fall in the same phase of the cycle as support for fatteners. Plus, the weight of piglets various enormously, from 8 to 30 kg, and there is, as it were, no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets, meaning that there is no basis on which to support them. I think it is far better here to establish an economic balance between the price of piglets and the price of slaughter pigs through the market rather than through artificial measures. More importantly, we must not forget that in numerous countries farmers fatten their piglets themselves and hence have direct access to the compensation fund via the fattened pigs which they sell.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept proposed Amendment No 16 because this amendment would interfere drastically with the freedom of decision of farmers who decide not to participate in the fund, in order to retain their freedom. Plus, the measures have not been defined, meaning that the decision on the measures to be applied basically stays in the hands of the Member States. That would be genuine renationalisation and I cannot agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The planned reduction in production for each Member State depending on previous production sounds suspiciously like a quota regulation. Plus, it would generate huge bureaucratic costs, including for the purpose of controls. The Commission feels that it is only fair to subject farmers who participate in the fund to some sort of discipline, because they receive a certain income guarantee in return, whereas others, who do not participate, have no such guarantee. In addition to these four core questions which the debate on the report has thrown up, there is a series of other, less fundamental proposed amendments, most of which deal with the details of the regulation – details which, in my view, should be included not in the Council regulation but in the implementing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as adjusting aid on the basis of the number of animals is concerned, may I point out that the Commission proposal already makes provision for a legal basis for just such a procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I should like to touch on a question addressed mainly in proposed Amendment No 6, namely improving statistics on herd trends and the possibility of forecasting production trends. I really do not think that a new law or new provisions are needed here. What is needed is proper, comprehensive application of current provisions by the Member States and their statistics offices. My services have drawn the outstanding problems to the attention of their Eurostat colleagues responsible for inventories and have pushed for results to be improved here. We have discussed this on several occasions over recent months and it is clear from our discussions that we have no shortage of provisions; what we are short of is people who take the provisions seriously, carry out the inventories of pig herds correctly and answer the questions put to the Member States truthfully.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have understood from what I have said that I am unable to accept your proposed amendments. However, I thank you for the serious debate which we have had here and I hope that we shall be able to reach a result on the basis of the Commission proposal, because the problem here – and I make no bones about it – is that the Member States still have very differing views on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that the Commission had no intention of changing the common organisation of the market in pigmeat. But the title reads "on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat". Then what, pray, has the Commission presented to us? If you want fewer radical changes than we do, then we can come to an agreement, but if you do not want any changes, then the text is a farce. Perhaps you could explain. If you present Parliament with a proposal, Parliament takes the liberty of introducing its proposals. As is our right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it represents a change to the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, of that there can be no question.
