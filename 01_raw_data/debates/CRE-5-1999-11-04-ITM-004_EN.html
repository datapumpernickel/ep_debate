<p class="contents">Two circumstances have shown us that this is a difficult matter: an almost unanimous joint agreement on the urgency and importance of adopting efficient policies to combat unemployment and for this to happen within a framework where the necessary support for a positive economic process will safeguard social cohesion and the European social model. </p>
<p class="contents">That the conditions are complicated is shown by the way our agreement on these objectives often runs the risk of collapsing when it comes to establishing the solutions and strategies for action. I will therefore concentrate on the things that I believe can be strengthened in the future and which can form one of the elements to be discussed in our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think that, as regards supply policies to boost employment, our intervention, the joint intervention of the Community institutions of the Member States, is important but it is not enough. I think there is insufficient coordination between the policies on labour, employment, and managing the job market and the policies which affect structural factors and in the macro-economic framework. There is an insufficient level of structuring and investment in efficient Community institutions capable of managing these processes where it is not enough just to respect the competences and the prerogatives of the national States. Regarding this matter, I would mention only one problem for the Members who, on the other hand, always show this sensitivity in particular. We consider unemployment to be an evil to combat, certainly not a circumstance to exploit even in the competition between countries’ economic systems and production systems for instrumental competition based on social dumping. I have never fully understood what is meant when reference is made to a job with a social content but, on the other hand, I definitely do know that a perspective of increasing employment by reducing the fundamental safeguards and fundamental objectives of social cohesion is not possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards active policies on the job market, training and retraining, all important guidelines, I think the level of consensus is insufficient, even on credible gauges of the effectiveness of these policies within national plans on employment, with regard to which the whole range of Community Institutions is, in any case, committed to assessing the successes and results. When we abandon compensatory policies and passive polices in favour of active policies, we cannot be satisfied by a casual use of words. What counts in gaining qualifications, training and retraining is action. When talking about the suffering of millions of people, statistics are often deceptive. We cannot allow them to be used as drunkards sometimes use lampposts – as support when they are unsteady, instead of to light up the way forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EMU has been successful in the sense that, once the various countries had established common goals concerning inflation, interest rates and budget deficits, it emerged that coordination of this kind led to the objectives also being achieved. Inflation is now low, levels of interest are low and budget deficits are either low or have disappeared altogether. However, cooperation of this kind in the economic sphere is much too one-sided. We therefore pursued the question of cooperation in the employment field too, with a view to its having the same importance as cooperation in the economic field. This became possible through the Amsterdam Treaty and by the fact that the Luxembourg process had been set in motion. </p>
<p class="contents">Now we are to discuss the guidelines for next year, that is to say for the year 2000. The Commission has no doubt been right to base these guidelines upon last year’s and to ensure that no unduly large changes are introduced from year to year. We still think, however, that increased clarity in a number of areas would be no bad thing. Let me mention a few such areas. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there must be more coordination between the formulation of the economic guidelines and that of the employment policy guidelines. Secondly, as Mrs Van Lancker also mentioned, we must have clearer objectives when it comes to increasing the level of employment and reducing long-term unemployment. It is important that, in these areas, we establish objectives and have a system of benchmarking<span class="italic"> </span>for the future so that we can achieve the objectives concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to concentrate mainly upon the social security systems. In Amendment No 1, we say that we especially urge that a strategy be created for social convergence which is analogous to the Luxembourg process regarding employment and with the help of which it can be ensured that the goal of social cohesion is given priority in the development of economic and employment policies. That is not the first time we have said this. Rather, this Parliament said much the same thing in connection with the Pronk report too. It was sensible then, and it is sensible now, to support this. Mr Pronk said previously that we cannot always support Social Democratic proposals. No, I can understand that, but one might at least support one’s own proposals. Those which were sensible a year ago are just as sensible today. </p>
<p class="contents">What is the connection, then, between economic development, employment and the social security systems? In fact, there is a connection in as much as economic stability is necessary for an increase in employment, and high employment is necessary to safeguard the social security systems. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, does this not conflict with the principle of subsidiarity? The answer is no. If we look at the way in which employment strategy has been formulated, the objectives are shared but policy is formulated at local level. The same will be true when we aim at social convergence. We shall establish a number of common objectives in terms of combating poverty, establishing sustainable pension systems, securing good health care for all and designing a system which stimulates employment. None of this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is imperative that we regard the irrefutable fact that unemployment has fallen by 10.1% to 9.4% as being a positive step forward and that we also regard the employment policy embarked upon by the European Union with its four fundamental pillars in the same light while adding to this linguistic training and the issue of immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we need to assess more thoroughly the creation of conditions at Community level whereby these processes can be monitored and regulated efficiently. We also believe that Europe can and must do more, so that the Europe of the euro will be able to function if we construct a social Europe, a Europe of solidarity and a secure Europe with more incisive macro-economic policies, linked to structural reforms which will stabilise and reorganise the States’ public finances. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that employment policies are national policies, but it is also true that they must now be reproduced at European level, because only through conciliation and social dialogue will we succeed in consolidating the European Parliament’s power on employment policy, and this is the policy that will enable Europe, finally and decisively, to have a political, as well as an economic definition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we must never forget that this is just a possibility. Between this possibility and the reality of the job itself everything will depend on the state of job vacancies in society. On this subject, the guidelines speak of enterprise spirit. They are right but, in order to flourish, the entrepreneur needs favourable policy, low interest rates, a competitive euro and, above all, he needs to know the relationship between a given business activity and the number of job offers. This is the fundamental problem of the relationship between employment levels and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">You acknowledge that with growth at less than 2.4% there was no reduction in employment. France is currently refuting this diagnosis thanks to its policy of reducing working hours, which is still too cautious. Let us hope that this policy is intensified and that it is extended in a coordinated fashion to Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one form of enterprise which is particular good at creating jobs; i.e. cooperatives, associations, the third sector. This sector merits a special status, particularly as regards taxation, and this is the subject of the amendments which we are putting to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a bad time for employment in Europe, with seventeen million unemployed and sixty million people living in poverty. If employment levels have remained identical to the 1994 levels within the Community, this is principally due to the massive loss of job security. We are really far short of the target. The Union needs to be ambitious in its employment policies, it needs voluntarist and binding policies, breaking away from the destructive rationale that is currently at work. At a time when money should be used to meet the needs of men and women, the needs of society, the Michelin case is a symbol of the tyranny of the law of filthy lucre over the economy and over individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe are waiting for clear signals from Parliament. In order to be effective, then, the guidelines should include quantifiable objectives enforcing job creation. Reduction of working hours without reducing wages, without job flexibility or insecurity, should be the order of the day as we approach the year 2000. The Union should be ambitious in using money in favour of employment, monitoring public funds awarded to businesses, with a credit policy which penalises destructive practices and promotes job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, declaring equal opportunities means that we must reject any form of discrimination against women, particularly with regard to wages.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Menrad has done a good job in difficult conditions, to be sure. The report includes many good points, but it does not, in my opinion, live up to our demands and expectations, despite taking a series of amendments debated in the Commission into account. It is not surprising, therefore, that a series of crucial amendments have again been proposed here by my own group and others. Whether these amendments are taken on board by this House will demonstrate the real will of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also say that, although his work does not define a Community law, it is impossible to ignore the importance of Parliament’s voice on a topic which is defined as a Union priority, employment. Moreover, I think that Mr Menrad’s report, supplemented by contributions he has had the courtesy to take into consideration, is actually the best possible within the confines of the subject, Parliament’s competences and the constructive methods of Europe. Nevertheless, the employment issue is not only found in the laudable work that Parliament can and will be able to do, but in a much broader field, sometimes with additional competences, sometimes with transient contents. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s recommendations and assessments of this subject are, of course, valuable, but there are aspects of this undertaking which seem to conflict. Yesterday, we heard the Council and the Commission talk about the impending start of the macroeconomic dialogue, but opinions and indications from this will not be published – this is what we were told. But it is not so much this as the rather uncertain spirit which has emerged, full of hope but lacking the desire to coordinate. The aim that was announced with the launch of the single currency seems to be to create confidence in the economic policies through the stability of monetary policies, prices and budgetary policies, as well as pay moderation and flexibility. And yet, today, the national macroeconomic dialogues have been shifted to a regional level. Conciliation has affected the regions and the Union in general and their programming ability, including their use of structural instruments and when devising models of local growth. However, I do not think that the Committee of the Regions is participating in the European macroeconomic dialogue, or that there are indicators in the assessment of the achievements of the States with regard to the creation of employment polices at local level, which are often entrusted only to the activism and will of the social partners. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a fundamental role in employment strategies and social integration is reserved for these very social partners, and there is still no clear definition of the role of the social partners in their capacity as NGOs. But that is not all. We cannot only deal with pay moderation and flexibility for their own sake, because this would misrepresent the nature and spirit of the national dialogues, the maintenance of social protection systems and all the planning instruments negotiated on the subject, sensitive not only to small and medium-sized businesses but also to those sectors that are more compatible with tradition and the characteristics of the territory. Taxation and security are certainly not secondary considerations, on the contrary they are more important than moderation and flexibility. The hope is to establish an exclusively European model that is more coordinated and more transparent but also more determined where the States, because of their diversity, are not only divided into the strong and the weak. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking here about the three countries which are outside the euro area. This is in itself worth noting. I want to latch onto that graceful term “level of employment”. This is one of those euphemisms which conceal the problem that, in this richest part of the world, we have 60 million citizens who are living under the poverty line and more than 20 million unemployed. It is noteworthy and thought-provoking that the countries outside the euro area have higher levels of employment and, if we look outside the European Union, we find a still higher level of employment, namely in our neighbouring country, Norway. The main cause of this problem area of employment, this blemish upon our society, is in fact macroeconomic. It is the EMU convergence criteria which, in themselves, promote unemployment. When we voted on the Amsterdam Treaty in Denmark, we were told that a number of decisive leaps forward in the direction of actively combating unemployment were being taken. We never believed this. On the contrary, the macroeconomic reality is the opposite. The EMU project creates unemployment and, where active labour market policy is concerned, it is transparently obvious that this presupposes local and national initiatives, and this on the very grounds that the labour markets in the countries of the European Union are organised on such widely different lines that it is impossible to implement anything other than the quite general and non-binding measures specified in the proposals we have before us. There are a lot of words, but there is a poignant gap between the words and the reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not what you might call a positive result, especially if you consider that the slight upturn in 1999 was due, primarily, to an improvement in the economic situation in which neither governments nor the European Union played any part. You might even say that, in France, the creation of jobs in retail was achieved in spite of government policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To tell the truth, reading the two Menrad reports, one cannot help thinking that the European Union is attempting to offer first aid, even though it is its own policy which is largely responsible for the social troubles affecting tens of millions of Europeans. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, Brussels has had official, full and legal access to a new area of interference in social and employment matters. Indeed, it cannot be repeated often enough that it is its ultraliberal internal policies and ultra-internationalist external policies, its cult of the opening of frontiers and of the almighty market which have brought our economies to their present plight.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of guidelines proposed by the Commission may seem positive. Surprisingly, one can even find common-sense proposals in them for a voluntarist family policy. But the good ideas are limited to the chapter headings, whilst examination of the detailed measures reveals the true nature of the Union’s action on employment. This action is just another pretext to extend the jurisdiction of Brussels to areas where its intervention can be nothing other than harmful – social protection, retirement, wage policy, taxation. We will be spared nothing: harmonisation, unification of legislation, alignment to the lowest bid in social terms. We can expect loss of job security, the erosion of working conditions, widespread social decline. It is indeed time for a change in policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As British conservatives we share the concern expressed throughout this House that the high level of unemployment in the EU as a whole is indeed a major problem and that a significant decline has to be the aim. Specifically we welcome the references to equal opportunities including the old as well as the young unemployed and for the need to promote employment of the disabled. We welcome the comments of the EMAC committee that the need for administrative costs and taxes and charges on SMEs to be reduced should be particularly stressed as these represent one of the biggest obstacles to growth in employment. We also welcome the general call for a tax review for reductions in fiscal and social security burdens plus red tape, all of which increase unemployment and bear down on jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not accept one key conclusion about the single currency, where it is stated to be fact that the implementation of economic and monetary union creates a good climate for new jobs. It is not a fact. The experiment has just begun and our views on the single currency are well known.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we do not accept that it is for the EU to lay down prescriptive rules for Member States on the key issue of unemployment and we regard as very ominous some of the suggestions from Members opposite this morning that the guidelines should become reinforced or indeed binding. Different problems in different Member States require different national solutions to create the right climate for their businesses to create jobs. So, if and when these guidelines become rules, dictating to national governments what they must do, then we would oppose them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, at the same time, I hope not only to express satisfaction but also concern, because the project and the procedure, in my view, are ambiguous. Together with the clear fact that it is very important that the Union has, as one of its objectives, a high level of employment and social protection, we can see that the data shows that there is still an enormous gap between the support given and the needs of those people whose families and themselves personally suffer from the scourge of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would describe this procedure as insufficient, not because it is naïve to believe that it is easy to carry out, nor because it is puerile to ask the Commission and the Council to achieve objectives which are beyond their capabilities. I believe that it is insufficient because we are still treating the problem as if it were a current problem when, in reality, Europe is suffering from a structural problem of an historic nature, born of a change in production methods, born of an increase in productivity in work which leads to increases in production and wealth which do not result in increases in employment and that this increase in wealth is distributed amongst companies and the workers who are in work, leaving those in a worse situation out of the picture: women, unqualified young people and the long-term unemployed. To sum up, it is because we continue basically to believe that the market will resolve a problem which cannot be resolved by the market because it is not a current problem, but rather a problem caused by our model of society.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like to take advantage of the few seconds remaining to say to the Commissioner – while thanking her for being here – that she should keep an eye on the figures provided by the Governments, firstly, to ensure that those figures are accurate and, secondly, so that they do not continue to provide data on active policies which are actually figures arising from taxes on employment and social welfare contributions. We see, although we do not have time to illustrate it, that in the Governments’ reports, figures are given on new initiatives on active policies, but they are being financed through taxes on employment and social welfare contributions. I therefore think that the Commission should be more diligent so that, so to speak, “they do not have the wool pulled over their eyes” and let us see whether, finally, in the year 2000, we may have criteria and levels to measure our objectives, our means and our results in terms of quality rather than just quantity. Only in this way will European employment strategy be more than just propaganda in some of our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The message I would like to convey to the Commissioner is as follows: let us not simply stay with the framework as it is presented, with interest in employment fading. Let us get back to basics and realise that it is not possible to have a better employment policy if, after the phase of economic and monetary convergence, we do not wish to establish full social and fiscal convergence, with standards common to all the States of the Union.</p>

<p class="contents">The outcome of the national plans of action in terms of modernisation is very disappointing indeed. It partly deals with partnership and consultation of employees and partly with new types of work and working times. The then Green Paper on the modernisation of the organisation of labour was an incentive to overcome the kind of labour organisation that is based on strong arm tactics. It hardly had any impact at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports show that in some countries the low level of participation of people older than 55, women – think of the gender divide – seems to go hand in hand with relatively low unemployment. The people’s opinions on their work in terms of stress and all sorts of other phenomena are extremely negative. It is against this background, in particular, that the drafting of guideline 16, the modernisation of labour organisation, has been rather disappointing and it is likely that too much is being left for the European social partners i.e. employers to deal with. </p>
<p class="contents">If the next round of national plans of action still does not yield any progress then we feel that stronger measures should be taken. I would like to appeal to the Commission to pay more attention to the quality of the work rather than just the quantity of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, I see the enhancement of regional and local employment initiatives and the greater emphasis on equal opportunities for women in employment policy as being positive, although I believe that Mrs Theorin’s criticism in this respect is still valid. Nevertheless, I think that the basic positions are inadequate. Each one of us has too many unemployed people amongst his or her constituents. We should have rejected that old chestnut put forward by the Commission that the unemployed ought to be encouraged, by deregulating the labour market and imposing social constraints, to look for work or seek assistance under employment policy measures. I believe that the causes of mass unemployment are essentially structural and socio-political. Sweeping references to service sector jobs in the USA make the picture quite clear: everyone knows that these are mainly underpaid jobs with no social security net. Anyone who wants to follow this US model is accepting or even participating in the destruction of the welfare state in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that it has become fashionable to ignore macroeconomic analysis. As long as financial markets are more lucrative than investing in business, then the problem of unemployment will no doubt remain unsolved.

Thanks to the constructive proposals for employment policies of Member States for the year 2000, proposals based on a fair analysis of the joint report on employment, Mr Menrad’s report outlines the route to be taken for Europe to maximise the potential of its extraordinary human capital. It is significant, too, that the report makes mention of demographic trends, as it is true that an ageing continent is a continent which is committing economic suicide. The report falls completely in line with the Luxembourg Process, for which, personally, I would have preferred objectives giving specific figures, and it is also in line with our desire to receive the report proposed by the Commission on the annual national employment action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I share the opinion of the rapporteur who stresses the need for our institution, jointly with the Commission, to supervise the implementation of European initiatives on employment within Member States. It is essential for a transparent and democratic public debate to take place and I have no doubt that if the Luxembourg process took place it was because Parliament was to some extent instrumental in this. But what I would like to say is that I consider it to be essential that this strategy which is just beginning to bear fruit should not be obstructed by rigid measures which are not adapted to the interests of businesses or of workers. Yesterday, members of the French Parliament met with French industrialists, and they reiterated that they did not want to see rigid and unsuitable measures obstructing this movement in favour of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the second part of my intervention. I would like to stress the role of social dialogue within the framework of this policy. Social dialogue must be renewed. It is essential for workers to participate in the decisions which affect them and if, at the time, Mr Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, had consulted the European Advisory Committee, created and proposed by this House, we would no doubt not have had the Vilvorde affair, and we would not perhaps have had the Michelin case. Secondly, the voluntary participation of employees in the production capital of their firm is also desirable and urgently needed, as the rapporteur writes in Amendment No 12 to the employment guidelines, for two reasons: firstly, for financial reasons, involving the need to improve businesses’ allocation of equity capital, in order to withstand the dictates of the major investment funds and to safeguard employment, but also for a human reason connected with the evolution of jobs in the future, requiring an ever higher level of training and a personal commitment which is only given true worth and encouraged intelligently by profit sharing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report provides a helpful basis which, it also has to be said, has been very greatly improved upon by our shadow rapporteur Anna Van Lancker.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Liberals who have spoken, I would like to tell them that their theory that Europe does not need an employment policy comes five years too late. European employment policy has already undeniably demonstrated its value. Various analyses have shown that the Member States have taken many sensible initiatives, that they are taking workers’ initial and further training more seriously than before and that new jobs have been created by means of this employment policy, and above all, Mr Brie, in the services sector. Our committee does not want to see new jobs in services with pay below the poverty level, as in America – we want quality employment in services also closely linked with production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to criticise the policy adopted up to now, especially the measures taken by Member States. We are not being persistent enough in fighting the exclusion of older workers, and it is evident that in all Member States, even in Sweden, women do not participate to the same extent in working life.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that despite the Employment Pact, despite the social dialogue, employers – businesses – are totally ignoring this issue. There is an urgent need for them to become involved, and financially too! It is not acceptable for the financing of employment policy to be a matter solely for the Member States and solely for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, both sides of industry must of course be involved in the process of renewing and modernising employment in the Member States. Involving employees and keeping them informed is a prerequisite for this. The Commission needs to play a more active role here, because there is still a great deal to be done in this area, as we saw in last week’s debate on Michelin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for the European Parliament to be involved in the guidelines, that much we agree upon. It is, however, also essential, as Anna Van Lancker has already said, to have specific, measurable benchmarks for the guidelines. That is why we are tabling these amendments. I have to say that I totally fail to comprehend why our Conservative friends do not want to support measurable benchmarks for the Member States, for example increasing the employment rate or achieving a specific reduction in long-term unemployment over five years. You will even be helping the Socialist and Social-Democrat heads of government in a way that could scarcely have been expected!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention – since our Conservative friend has already told us this – that the euro is probably also a successful example of employment policy. All Member States have worked to comply with the stability criteria, as have those countries that wish to join the European Union. We also need these specific criteria for employment policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it does contain some really crucial points, in particular on information systems and the policies facilitating the transfer of these systems to labour. It is also right to emphasise, as do Amendments 2 and 3 to Guidelines 1 and 2, that long-term unemployment cannot be fought effectively with State subsidies. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise three limits which we still have to resolve concerning employment policies that the Commission proposal does not adequately address. First of all, there is still not enough attention being given to small and medium-sized industry, which has other problems apart from an excessive tax burden, which is typical of large industry too. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the document does not even mention the role of an active credit policy intended to support firms – the European credit system is still light-years away from the American system in this regard – and I think that the endeavours of the European Union and the Member States to redirect it have, until now, been very weak. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the main shortcoming of these documents concerns the definition of the role of the regions and local authorities in an active labour policy. If we continue to think in terms of macroeconomic planning and we do not start instead with conciliation at local level and between administrators, trade unions and entrepreneurs in establishing concrete development plans based on actual resources, then we will never address the root of the employment problem. To this end, Amendment No 15 to Guideline 12 is important, but still not sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should be explicit in the guidelines about the measures that can be implemented like parental benefits, childcare facilities and policies to combat sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to call on the Member States to do more than promote equal pay. The directive on equal pay was adopted over twenty years ago but there is still a 28% pay gap so we should strengthen the wording in the guidelines and urge the Member States to adopt measures to ensure equal pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report on the implementation of the employment policies stated that Member States had failed to go beyond token efforts at alleviating gender inequalities. Successful mainstreaming requires that the people making policy understand how to implement it effectively. So there is a need for training and awareness raising and a better balance of women and men in decision making. Research just published in Wales that I represent has shown once again that women are hugely under-represented in management positions at work and do not move up the career ladder as quickly as their qualifications should allow. We know this is a typical scenario and it merits specific attention in the guidelines. So I would ask Members to support Amendments Nos 37 and 38 which would achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proves that what is essential, apart from employment guidelines, are changes to economic/financial and monetary policies.

I therefore think that both aspects covered in the Menrad report are important, because peace and security on the one hand and growth and employment on the other are key policy priorities for the European Union. But the review process and target setting release neither the Member States nor the two sides of industry from their main responsibility for employment policy in their countries, because they are specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Benchmarking has been mentioned. I would like to add a few thoughts here. We are all talking about primarily structural unemployment. There are several indicators of structural unemployment: excessively high labour costs, lack of flexibility in working hours and general employment profile, an underdeveloped services sector, an over-heavy state and bureaucratic regulatory burden, slow rates of innovation and long lead times between scientific findings and implementation in production. </p>
<p class="contents">So the first step we need to take along this path is to further reduce public debt. In most countries, we are still taking on new debts to pay off old ones. That means mortgaging the future, especially for the younger generation. We need more scope for the investment required for the future. Secondly, we have to combat structural indicators and step up the pace of structural reform, if we really want to bring down unemployment in the long term and not just increase employment figures. Thirdly, we need to give innovation in education policy a boost, because many young people, and also the long-term unemployed, cannot find work on the job market with their qualifications, because they are not yet adequately qualified to cope with new developments in technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must make it easier to start up new businesses, and we should support the small and medium-sized companies that provide and create 80% of the jobs in Europe with a harmonised and coordinated fiscal policy, and remove the constraints on starting up new businesses. If we proceed in accordance with the guidelines and these principles, then we will not only increase the number of those in work, but also reduce existing unemployment, and that is our goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the amendments express the anguish of us all over the most difficult problem of the single market – the problem of unemployment. This has a bearing, although this has not been voiced, on the fate of our democracies because, as history has taught us, democracies are not maintained just by the production of wealth; they also presuppose distribution on a large scale to the large majority of the population which, in today’s society, presupposes guaranteeing employment. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the most interesting recommendations from the proposed amendments is the development of more analytical, comparative, quantitative objectives and parallel statistical data with a view to improving comparative evaluation. However, it should be noted that, in acknowledging that unemployment is not just a quantitative but also a qualitative factor, the quantification of the qualitative aspects of employment must be more extensive in respect of levels of income, working hours and special working conditions. After all, leaving aside for the moment the actual form of employment, this is by no means unfeasible. Qualitative data of this kind are the spirit of our social model and, with this in mind, there should be some means of representing minimum protection and the rate of reduction in the invisible sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, employment growth must be linked to the type of activities which do actually stimulate it, because increasing employment using measures adapted to transitory working models is only a short-term solution and a waste of resources. In this sense, Amendment No 9 in Guideline 7 is on the right track. However, it does not fully accord with Guidelines 1 and 2, which specify vocational training with a view to effective integration into the labour market. The amendment incorporates the term “lasting integration into the labour market”, which is an improvement. The Member States should, however, interpret this to mean that the main part of the programmes should not be based on past activities but on those which aim primarily at achieving a capacity to create.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">One further remark concerning the services sector. Guideline 13 rightly mentions the development of the services sector and of industry-related services. I believe that a broader approach should have been taken on these issues. Developing the service sector can be effected in two opposing ways. On the one hand, we have the development of services within all sectors of production, including the agricultural sector, of which no mention has been made,<span class="bold"> </span>thus breaking down the barriers between them<span class="bold"> </span>and, on the other hand, we have the industrialisation of the service sector. The former creates wealth and so mention should have been made of services in the agricultural sector, whereas the latter, banks and insurance companies for instance, will lead to job losses and therefore other measures will have to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recognising this does not mean removing the Member States' competences, but asserting that with a broader and more cohesive view of the employment issue we can work with greater efficiency to address one of the most important matters of our time. We therefore need an institutional balance split between the Union’s objectives and guidelines and the Member States’ free choices. The Committee is a first step in this direction, but it is not enough. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the guidelines, I would like to talk specifically about the part which concerns the transition from school to work. This aim is not pursued only by the albeit commendable proposals contained in Guidelines 7 and 8. Certainly, it is good that schools are recognised as having a fundamental role in combating unemployment, but there is no reference to the need for schools to operate in the field of planning within Europe as a whole, encompassing the participation of social partners, local organisations and the business world. Therefore, the Commission needs to refer to this aspect and undertake to promote support programmes which will encourage this perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are tired of woolly declarations of intent where tough decisions are called for. Now, just before the turn of the Millennium, we are reaping the harvest that we sowed at the Luxembourg Employment Summit in 1997. Under Christian Democrat leadership we were successful in persuading political, economic and social actors to join the practical battle against unemployment and for new work structures. The group pressure predicted actually materialised. Who would want to be one of the ones who have not done their homework? Furthermore, there is added value at European level if the two sides of industry can also learn from each other how to develop new concepts and to implement pilot schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">It was absolutely right to nominate Winfried Menrad as rapporteur of the 2000 report. All three committees that I belong to concur with much of his excellent work, which was produced under considerable time pressure. That certainly applies to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, with perhaps a few reservations, to the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, where the maxim “less would have been more” applies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report indicates that much of the progress will not be sustainable. In one case there is a lack of macroeconomic thinking, in another a failure to implement structural reforms, and in the third a lack of coordination between economic and employment policy.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>There has obviously been an increase in preventive measures such as integrating the long-term unemployed into the labour market, and in active measures such as incentives to seek work or create jobs. But what is lacking is retraining leading to qualifications, and training facilities for young unemployed people. There is also a lack of part-time work models for older employees who are capable of work and keen to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget young people, who need access to practical experience with computers and the Internet. In this case the Member States are responsible for providing knowledge about information technology. Also, we must not forget those late developers who we need to give a second chance to by opening doors to our education and training systems. I am pleased to say that the biggest progress has been with small and medium-sized companies, which are now working in an improved environment for new start-ups, as various administrative burdens have been lifted. But we need action on access to risk capital and worker participation in production capital. In short, the four pillars of employability, entrepreneurial spirit, flexibility and equal opportunities are stable components of a framework to provide secure jobs in the future. My amendment, which has been accepted, seeks to ensure that we firmly adhere to the annual cycle for reviewing the guidelines, so that Member States do not let up in actively promoting employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It states that 1.8 million additional jobs have been created in Europe, and therefore confirms the four pillar structure and the main points of the guidelines. </p>
<p class="contents">We can agree on the need to keep the structure substantially unchanged. Nevertheless, despite Mr Menrad’s commendable work, both the Commission document and the European Parliament report could have and, above all, should have attempted more. In particular, coordination between the macroeconomic policies and the guidelines for employment must change from being simple dialogue to agreement between the Member States, without invalidating the competences and responsibilities of the States themselves, which no-one is calling into question. However, the guidelines and recommendations at European level need to be transformed into concrete, quantifiable objectives which the Member States must aim towards with their own national plans – concrete objectives which define targets that we can gauge in the medium term, converging in terms of employment levels and the reduction of the current gap between the employment of men and women, and also through investments in infrastructure and services and the promotion of youth employment. We need to establish quantitative and qualitative indicators. It is not a question of a solution at European level, as some fear, but it is, of course, a question of recommending a range of instruments which will effectively allow us to create employment and bring about social cohesion. We need, then, to take a giant leap forwards. We need to be bold. The launch of the single currency was possible because constraints were set down. If we do not do the same for employment we will never achieve sufficient results.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the main responsibility for the project naturally lies with the Member States, to carry through such a large-scale programme of reform without coordination at Union level would be politically impossible in the single market. The European employment policy is, indeed, badly in need of reform! The basic structures of the Member States are the biggest problems. High taxes, enormous levels of welfare contributions and an inflexible pay policy often lead to a situation where society becomes demoralised and where work no longer is a financially motivating alternative for the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework exists, however, for bringing about change. The single currency offers a splendid environment for the promotion of employment. Establishment of the internal market will inevitably add flexibility to the labour market which, in turn, will make the entire European economy more dynamic. In addition, the convergence of the economic policies of the euro countries as a result of the single currency offers the opportunity to seek optimal models, a process known as benchmarking. A prerequisite of this is, of course, that we have comparable indicators; these have already been mentioned a few times here this morning; and, why not – sometimes we should look for these models outside the borders of the European Union, as well. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for guidelines is very appropriate, and in particular Mr Menrad, the rapporteur, has done some excellent work. I would especially like to emphasise the importance of the measures taken to improve the employment facilities of SMEs. We simply have to try to reduce administrative costs, taxes and expenses. At the same time, I would also like to refer to the VAT experiment in the service industries which the Member States, with a few exceptions, do not appear willing to join at present despite the fact that it was duly carried through in the Council, I wish this matter had had a different outcome, at least as far as my own country, Finland, is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it slightly worrying that the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000 are coming under discussion before the tangible actions regarding the old guidelines have been concluded or even started. The Member States have committed themselves to implement these guidelines in their own national programmes. They must also be given the opportunity to do this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission will have to take into account the proposals of Parliament which, although it has been left out of this process, still bears responsibility for the unemployed: it is essential that Parliament accepts its responsibilities as regards the problem of illegal work and the people who live and work in run-down industrial zones.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the absence at a national level of any real dialogue involving serious commitments is hampering the modernisation of technology and organisation, and the Michelin case is a prime example of this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress that pensioners and the elderly are happy to give their jobs to young people. There are 630 Members here. I am sure that many of us would willingly give our position to young Members. Of course, we would not increase the number of jobs but at least we would increase the number of young people who do not have a job, and in this way, they would have the satisfaction they deserve. I would like to say that the Member States’ endeavours must be such as to place the elderly, who have paid quite enough for their pensions, in a position to leave their jobs to young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is precisely at a time when prosperity is returning to Member States across this European Union that those marginalised from the world of work can and must be helped. If that is not achieved now, these victims of social exclusion will be left out altogether for all time.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is quite right in its report to criticise lack of progress on employment for these disadvantaged groups within the Member States and to call for greater mainstreaming in our employment programmes linked to measures to combat discrimination. This European Parliament is right in our Amendment No 13 to support the holistic approach and for the development of comparable targets, which I will refer to in a moment and which I call on all in this Parliament to support.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the examples in the report, in particular concerning employment of people with disabilities. On this morning, when welfare benefits for disabled people are causing great public debate in my own country, the United Kingdom, I welcome our example of the new deal for disabled people which has sought to break down the barriers by providing personal advisers at the local level through what is known as a single gateway to use flexibly both employment and social security budgets with unemployed disabled people to genuinely find the measures which will assist them into work. But here, at the European level, we can do more. If it has been possible to secure performance targets from Member States in relation to both youth and long-term unemployed people, why do we not seek a similar target to improve the employment of disabled unemployed people too. And, if it is the absence of reliable statistics cited as the problem, urgent action for adequate definitions of the information should be called for. If we do not do this, perhaps the Commissioner could explain how we can possibly evaluate the success of our policies and how disabled, unemployed people can be helped back into work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bodrato (PPE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Menrad’s report appears quite correct in giving the modernisation of labour a fundamental role in increasing productivity, competitiveness and therefore also employment. Nevertheless, the conclusions have some limits. There is competition between the Member States on labour policy and the standards of the European Social Model which does not contribute to the achievement of the objectives which we say we wish to pursue and the conditions which, in theory, are guaranteed. </p>
<p class="contents">When we state that the reduction of the tax burden on the cost of labour must not involve the reorganisation of public finances nor the balance of security systems, we are proposing a squaring of the circle that only strong economic growth can resolve. In reality, there is a trend to regain competitiveness by putting some social costs onto family budgets. In this way, though, the social divide will grow and, in some cases, marginalisation and fresh poverty will also increase. In any case, Europe risks in particular, in the globalisation of the markets, having to endure competition from those large economies which have invested, and continue to invest, more in technology and research, as well as in professional youth training, that is, in the future of hi-tech industries. So I think that Mr Menrad is right when, in his general conclusions, he emphasises the need for the Commission to harmonise the documents on the main lines of the economic policy and guidelines on employment. I think that, in this area, the Committee could be a very important step. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr Menrad on his work. I must also say that I listened attentively to, and would like to thank, Mr Grosch and Mrs Theorin for the opinions of their respective Committees on the issue of the Employment Package. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the outcome of this two-and-a-half hour discussion is extremely optimistic and it is clear that the European Parliament is following, debating and, above all, making proposals on the extremely sensitive issue of a European employment strategy. I would like to stress, since we have heard many opinions and proposals from various MEPs on the role of the Commission as regards setting targets for effective action, that the European employment strategy will support and encourage national policies and, in this regard, we are trying to cooperate as closely as possible with Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, the employment guidelines have been debated in the Committee on Employment and the Economic Committee, and intense deliberations are under way to get them to the Council, where we believe that they will be adopted in full. An official debate will be held on 29 November in the Joint Council between national finance ministers and employment ministers. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that apparently there is an agreement on how we should draft and implement guidelines for next year. There are no major changes, the 4 cornerstones still apply and the changes made to the guidelines are very small and cover 4 points. The first is greater focus on the transition from training to work, the second is in the area of information technology<span class="bold"> </span>where strenuous efforts are already being made, including the forthcoming Commission initiative on the information society, to coordinate the issue of employment with information technology;<span class="bold"> </span>the third is active involvement at local level,<span class="bold"> </span>where the Member States should pursue and work towards<span class="bold"> </span>increasing the role of local authorities and, of course, the role of the social partners. Madam President, I would like to comment very briefly on the some basic principles which came out of the Menrad report and which were taken up by many of the speakers. </p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it is clear that successful implementation of the European employment strategy requires a stable macroeconomic framework which is why there is close and continuous cooperation in the whole of the process of macroeconomic dialogue. </p>
<p class="contents">The second serious issue is the issue of indicators and harmonisation of statistical services and indicators of the Member States. It is an issue which, as was rightly said, is not technical and is not technocratic, but it is profoundly political. It is extremely important yet extremely difficult at the same time to have a monitoring system for the Member States. It is one of our priorities and we are trying to make a success of the process of harmonising indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point concerns the concept of lifelong learning. We have made some effort here, but it is clear from the recommendations to the Member States that not as much emphasis has been placed on lifelong learning as there perhaps should have been. Our goal for the coming year will be to have a more vigorous and better organised policy on lifelong learning of workers in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The next issue concerns information technology. There was mention of a target and a proposal for targets at national level in the area of the information society. I believe that we can be even more ambitious and set common European targets in the area of the information society because we cannot talk of the convergence of Member States unless there is convergence in the particularly sensitive area of the information society. Furthermore, I would like to remind you of the decision taken by the leading States in Cologne to equip schools with access to the Internet. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the extremely important issue of the development and formulation of policies by local authorities at regional level within the Member States. This was also one of the priorities and initiatives of the Finnish Presidency and we believe that the Council will consolidate such an approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of Parliament, the proposal for closer cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament to promote the strategy for the European policy has once again been reiterated. It is clear that from Cologne we do have specific procedures, such as the spring and autumn procedures, but of course, I am awaiting proposals and practical means of implementing closer cooperation, which should be initiated by the respective Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
