<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you have all read the publications that have appeared in the course of the past few hours. I think we are moving into a decisive phase in these negotiations. We have the Commission President here, as well as Minister Mavroyiannis as the Council’s representative, so I would like to say again that while the European Parliament has undoubtedly adopted some ambitious decisions, it is fully mindful of the responsibility to maintain the European Union’s performance capacities and ensure that the objectives and tasks set by the heads of state and government continue to be affordable for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am assuming that the Council and the Commission will uphold these shared objectives, also in relation to the financial endowment that is to be provided for the European Union. I am sure that the Commission will abide by this course, although I am less certain that the Council has fully appreciated the critical nature of the situation. I hope that this will be elucidated during the course of today’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, this week’s extraordinary meeting of the European Council is convened in order to deal with the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last months the Cyprus Presidency and our trio of partners beforehand have invested a lot of time and effort into what is a very complicated and challenging file following last year’s Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Cyprus Presidency was to maintain the momentum and mature the dossier, preparing the file for a full discussion aiming to reach an agreement this year. To this end, we held extensive bilateral consultations in July, followed by an issues paper and an informal General Affairs Council meeting in Cyprus. Then, we issued two non-papers on various issues covering macroeconomic conditionality, better spending, RAL, flexibility and corrections, trying to advance the discussion and provide solutions where possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Having taken into account the wish of Parliament to wait for the vote on the relevant interim report, we only introduced for the first time figures in late October in the negotiating box. This proposal was underpinned by difficult political choices, trying to pave the way for a balanced agreement. Overall, I believe that work in the Council in the past few months and the interaction with all institutions and stakeholders has covered some important ground facilitating the prospects for an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">All along this process, we have worked very closely and constructively with Parliament. We met formally before and after each General Affairs Council according to the procedure agreed under the Hungarian Presidency. In addition, Parliament’s negotiating team was invited to participate at the informal ministerial meeting in Cyprus in August and also in an informal ministerial breakfast in Luxembourg last month. Of course, beyond these formal meetings, we have held many other informal discussions which have been very fruitful and conducive to advancing this file.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiating team of Parliament also had an extensive meeting with the cabinet of President Van Rompuy in the framework of the bilateral meetings held between 5 and 12 November 2012. On 13 November 2012, the President of the European Council presented a draft set of European Council conclusions which include all the elements which will need to be part of an agreement. The text presented further develops the work carried out by the presidencies, differentiating in a number of aspects, something normal at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday we had an extensive meeting with Mr Lamassoure, Chair of the Committee on Budgets, and the negotiating team of Parliament, along with the head of the cabinet of President Van Rompuy and the competent Commissioners. This meeting allowed for a fruitful and productive exchange of views on the draft European Council Conclusions and for Parliament’s substantial input. We all know how important it is to get the EU’s future financial framework right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency supports the President of the European Council in his determination to secure a deal later this week. This is essential for the credibility of the Union and for its ability to deliver to and on behalf of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This package takes us towards an eventual compromise. The proposal reduces the original Commission proposal by approximately EUR 75 billion for the MFF itself and an additional EUR 6 billion for those elements outside the MFF. The draft conclusions do not contain options.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has consistently sought to maintain the level of expenditure originally proposed by the Commission. Even if, on a personal basis, I may regret that this has not proved possible, we must all be realistic. Europe has been through one of the most severe crises, and despite significant efforts at both national and EU level, the effects of this crisis will continue to be felt for some time. We have no choice but to reflect this dire situation in the MFF and draw and assume the ensuring outfall.</p>
<p class="contents">We live at a time of severe constraint as a result of the need for fiscal consolidation. The negotiations on the European budget cannot take place in complete isolation from this reality, however uncomfortable that is. We need to cement together fiscal consolidation with investment in growth and jobs through an unavoidably tight MFF, which is our main investment tool.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are fully aware of the arguments on European added value, complementarity, synergy, economies of scale and how valid all those arguments are, but under the circumstances it was felt that these parameters could be appropriately addressed through the improvement of the quality of spending.</p>
<p class="contents">To reach a compromise we have to go below the Commission proposal. I cannot say now by how much exactly, but I believe that the latest proposals are not very far from where we are likely to end up. The conclusions put forward by the President of the European Council contain cuts across all headings.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards instruments outside the MFF and flexibility, the President has been guided by the principle that lower ceilings require greater flexibility in a seven-year framework. It is not therefore proposed to reduce the flexibility instrument. Furthermore, a contingency margin is part of the package.</p>
<p class="contents">You may have seen that the conclusions also put forward some proposals from the revenue side such as retaining the option of reforming the VAT-based own resource while the option of having the financial transaction tax as an own resource has also been kept on the table. Last, but not least, a reform of the system of corrections is proposed in order to make them more transparent and fair, within the limits of what seems to be achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole day tomorrow will be taken up with bilaterals between the Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission with all heads of state or government of Member States to test out the likely basis on which a compromise can be reached. The European Council will open tomorrow evening, with a discussion with you, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that President Van Rompuy is committed to achieving a compromise. The European Council is therefore expected to last as long as it takes.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that throughout this whole process the representatives of Parliament have been extremely helpful and cooperative. You will see that a number of your concerns have been addressed in the draft European Council conclusions. I am sure that all the institutions and the Member States will do their utmost to ensure that we reach a conclusion on this issue by the end of the year. The Cyprus Presidency stands ready to facilitate the agreement both amongst the Member States and with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">what is at stake is the prosperity and stability of Europe, its economic competitiveness and social cohesion. The goal is sustainable, job-creating growth, but as we all know, we cannot legislate for growth or create jobs by waving a magic wand.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Europe 2020 strategy to the conclusions of the European Council of June 2012, declarations calling for job-creating, sustainable development have come thick and fast. the question now is how the governments intend to match their deeds to their words.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions on the European Union’s future budgetary framework are a key test of our credibility, because the European budget is our main instrument for investing in growth and job creation. We have plenty of other ways to promote growth, through the internal market and international trade, for example, but in terms of investment the main tool is the European budget. </p>
<p class="contents">The European budget alone can ensure the funding for a European dynamic that national budgets individually could not support. This dynamic is crucial for growth and jobs in Europe, because it creates a genuine European area of economic, social and territorial cohesion, education, research and innovation, and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be perfectly clear: the governments will defend, first and foremost, what they see as their national interest, and it is for the Community institutions – the Commission and Parliament – to present the truly European dimension of the issues at stake. The Commission is still convinced that its proposals represent the general European interest and the interests of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget is not, as is sometimes claimed, a budget for Brussels or Strasbourg. More than 94 % of the budget is spent entirely on European citizens. It is a budget for investing in the economy of all Member States, our regions, towns and countryside. It is a budget for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and for strengthening convergence and European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus essentially what enables improvements to be made at European level to the lives of our fellow citizens, above all through the cohesion policy, which is the ultimate policy of solidarity, but equally a policy for growth, economic convergence and job creation. </p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy has been able to adapt to the circumstances and has proved more necessary than ever in these times of austerity. It is a policy that serves both the beneficiary countries and the contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">In a third of the Member States, more than 50 % of public investment is cofinanced with cohesion policy funds. In some countries, the rate is as high as 75 %, or even 97 %. </p>
<p class="contents">These figures show just how important these policies are. Without Structural Funds, these countries – especially most of the new Member States – will not be able to guarantee jobs or press ahead with their fiscal consolidation or structural reforms. </p>
<p class="contents">However, these policies also benefit the contributing countries, and specifically the largest contributors to the budget, whose companies in turn benefit from considerable investment opportunities. </p>
<p class="contents">In many cases, there is clear evidence that more than 50 % of the Structural Funds allocated to cohesion countries flow back to the economies of the major contributing countries, because it is the companies in these countries that are able to carry out large infrastructure projects and provide the necessary technology. This really is a win-win policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy is not just a policy for the poorest Members: according to the Treaties, it is a policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion for the entire European Union. It is a goal for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget of the European Union allows us to have genuinely common policies. As a result of the synergies achieved in this way, we can make savings while safeguarding the integrity of the single market. This is true of agriculture, for example, where 27 different national policies would be a lot more expensive than one common agriculture policy. Have we really thought about what would happen if there were no common agriculture policy? If we had market fragmentation in Europe as a result of 27 different national agricultural policies?</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP has always proved adaptable to new socioeconomic challenges, and is even now undergoing further reform. Europe needs a strong, up-to-date, competitive, innovative and green CAP more than ever, to meet the European public’s demands for food supplies and a healthy lifestyle, but also to help combat climate change and contribute to the sustainable management of our natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who say – and some do – that we must scale down our proposal because the Community budget must contribute to the vast fiscal consolidation effort under way in Europe, I say: ‘that is exactly what we are doing’. Pooling expenditure in our common policies represents added value and hence real savings, and it benefits, first and foremost, the European taxpayer. </p>
<p class="contents">To be quite clear, opposing this budget will not advance the cause of fiscal consolidation. It will, in fact, hamper it by sacrificing expenditure that brings greater synergies and efficiency, and promises greater returns. The European budget allows us to create a real European space that is much more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Sharing costs enables us to develop other projects, too, such as the free movement of knowledge, which we call the ‘fifth freedom’. This is how we will achieve better results in the key areas of education and research, which are vital to a competitive Europe that can maintain or establish its leadership in the sectors of the future. </p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly what we are proposing in our ‘Erasmus for All’ programme, which will cost less than 2 % of the total budget but will make a huge difference to millions of young Europeans who will be able to study, train and work in another country. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also what we are proposing in the Horizon 2020 programme, to ensure that Europe remains a place of innovation and spectacular scientific breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="contents">A group of Nobel Prize winners in the sciences and winners of the Fields medal for mathematics have signed a joint petition, which they presented to me recently in Brussels. This petition, which was launched by 44 European Nobel laureates and six Fields medallists and has already collected the signatures of over 130 000 European scientists, predominantly young researchers, reminds us that a euro invested in research and innovation, which brings together the very best talent at European level, will often have a greater impact than a euro spent at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">These researchers and scientists applaud the globally recognised success of the European Research Council set up by the European Union. At a time when the European Union is starting to attract the best researchers in the world and young European researchers are deciding to stay in Europe, the worst thing that Europe could do would be to cut off the fuel to the jet engine of European research and innovation just as the plane is taking off.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget also allows the Member States to finance projects that they would not be able to fund themselves, such as the large pan-European networks needed to ‘connect’ Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You are familiar with our proposal for the Connecting Europe Facility to promote interconnected trans-European networks in transport, energy and digital technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of Europe’s leading CEOs, whose vision is European and global, not parochial and mean-spirited, have signed a letter calling for the budget to support this Facility. Why? Because they know perfectly well that without the European budget there would be no lever to carry out this investment in the infrastructure that is essential to the Europe we envisage. </p>
<p class="contents">There are also areas where, by pooling our powers, we can achieve better results, for example in justice and security, in the smooth running of the Schengen area, and in the fight against illegal immigration. Things cannot go on as they are now. Whenever there is a very serious problem of illegal immigration, people look to Europe and ask what Europe is doing about it. As we all very well know, however, Europe does not have the resources to tackle this problem unless we share national powers in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are proposing, therefore, is better spending to achieve targeted results in our main priority areas. Some people are calling for cuts on all sides, on the grounds that it will not really make any difference to Europe. However, I can assure you that what might be a small amount for Europe as a whole can make an enormous difference to some of our policies and some of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What does each billion cut from the Horizon 2020 programme mean? It means 4 000 small and medium-sized enterprises deprived of financing for innovation to create jobs and growth; and 600 top researchers and their teams who will no longer be able to carry out their work, work upon which our future prosperity depends. It means, for example, the end of the Innovative Medicines Initiative in the health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">A small percentage cut for ‘Connecting Europe’ spells the end of European leadership in transport. It means abandoning our CO<span class="sub">2</span> reduction projects, such as the carbon capture and storage project, and dropping our plans to develop connections re-linking Eastern Europe with Western Europe. If we make cuts, even small ones, to the already relatively modest culture budget, we will forfeit job creation in a key sector and stifle European creativity at a time when this is more vital than ever.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Making cuts to the Commission’s proposal to create a Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived might not have a major impact on the overall amount, but it will make a dramatic difference to the 116 million Europeans, including 25 million children, facing poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, how do you explain to the people of Europe that when there are summits in Brussels to find hundreds of billions of euros to save the banks, we reach an agreement, but when it comes to a few million to help the poor, the negative voices outnumber the positive ones? What are they to make of that? </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we call into question the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund when there are unacceptable levels of unemployment in Europe, we will deprive millions of unemployed people of the chance to train and find work. We will also do away with one of the most innovative instruments for providing social support when companies relocate to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A few thousandths of a percentage cut to European Development Fund and humanitarian aid is a matter of life and death for the world’s most vulnerable people, because these are not just figures, but real people’s lives. Such a move would go against our values, but also our interests. I repeat: I am not just talking generally about values and interests here, I am talking about real people. For example, I recently visited a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan where UNICEF’s Executive Director told me that without European Union aid none of those young girls and boys would have access to education at all. The girls I saw there were studying in tents. Their towns had been destroyed by the Assad regime. They are pouring across the borders in their hundreds of thousands and Europe is there to help. Are we going to cut back our efforts now in the face of such tragedies?</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Mr President, you hosted the President of Haiti here in Strasbourg. I also had the opportunity to receive him in Brussels. On behalf of the Haitian people, he thanked Europe, which, in spite of its economic difficulties, has not forgotten Haiti, a country completely devastated by the earthquake that killed over 300 000 of its people. He thanked Europe for giving Haiti’s children hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In Africa, where we Europeans have a special responsibility, and in many other countries of the world, too, Europe cannot renege on its commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the Europe I believe in, that we all believe in: an open, caring Europe, a Europe that is not about to turn its back on the rest of the world!</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, giving the European Union the budget it deserves means giving ourselves the possibility of rebuilding the economy on new foundations. It also means keeping our promise that spending will be mobilised for growth and jobs, competitiveness and convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission remains committed to its initial proposal. The Union budget must genuinely support our growth agenda, and I am pleased to see that, in general, our proposals are backed by this Parliament and by a majority of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 November, I joined Parliament’s President at a summit of the Friends of Cohesion in the European Parliament in Brussels. It was organised jointly by the Prime Minister of Poland and the Prime Minister of Portugal and was attended by representatives of 16 governments, the social partners, BUSINESSEUROPE and the European Trade Union Confederation. The social partners, which do not always agree, are in agreement on this. They are pushing for the EU budget not to be cut as it is essential for growth. The message from them was clear and unanimous. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why I called on the ‘friends of cohesion’ and the friends of ‘better spending’ to unite in a grand European coalition of the ‘friends of growth’. The greatest risk I see today is that the cuts will damage those forward-looking areas that are essential for growth. There is a paradox here: it is precisely because of certain demands by the ‘better spending’ group that we are busy cutting the overall budget, which in all likelihood will most jeopardise those policies that look to the future and enhance competitiveness. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not deny that the better spending agenda is crucial, and I have said as much to the cohesion countries, too. I am a fan of cohesion, but I am also a fan of better spending. Let us be frank: we must be critical of some types of European spending that have not always brought added value as far as competitiveness is concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why we want to align cohesion policy with the Europe 2020 objectives for sustainable, intelligent growth, not just any form of growth. For this reason – and I know this is not very popular in certain quarters, but I have to say it – we are in favour of macroeconomic conditionalities in this area. We must align our various policies within the framework of the efforts being made for better economic governance. It is thus essential that our investment is efficient. The added value of every single euro is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I do wonder, nonetheless, whether those who would also like to make deep cuts in administrative expenditure are really concerned about efficiency, in the sense of wanting to make the best possible use of the resources available, or whether their real aim is to weaken the institutions like the Commission and the Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A swingeing cut in expenditure that represents less than 6 % of the budget would have only a minimal effect on the overall savings being sought. We need – and this has to be said – an independent civil service in Europe, a high-calibre civil service to draft laws and develop projects to serve Europe as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, let me add two further points. First, the Commission is fighting for appropriate flexibility. It must be possible to adapt the budget, over the years, to changes in the economic situation. The contributions must therefore be real money, not virtual resources, particularly when we are currently facing a crisis in certain Member States that need to be able to make investment not in 2020 but in 2014, under the new European budget and even before that under the budgets for 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission reiterates its proposal for a system of own resources that is closer to the rules of the Treaty, which state that the Union budget should be financed from own resources. It is important that in the next few days the European Council indicates its willingness to proceed in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thing, finally, ladies and gentlemen, is that we all work together towards these objectives, in a spirit of loyal cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, negotiation is all about making compromises. The Commission will go to the meeting of the European Council with this in mind, but we must remember that we need constructive compromises, compromises that strengthen Europe, not help to destroy it. Everyone has a role to play in this. What is important is that we have a budget that acts as a real catalyst for growth and job creation. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the Heads of State or Government meeting in Brussels to listen to the voices of the Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, who remind us that the future of Europe depends on research and innovation. Listen to the voices of Erasmus students, who want the best possible education. Listen to the voices of the regions, business organisations and trade unions in their own countries, who tell us how essential investment is for recovery and growth. Listen to the voices of entrepreneurs, who are waiting for investment in infrastructure to connect Europe by means of transport, energy and digital technology. Listen to the voices of the people queuing at food banks, who cannot understand why, in this current social crisis, so many countries offer so little hope to the poor. Listen to the voices of the unemployed, who look to Europe to offer better prospects for the future. Listen to the voices of our international partners, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental organisations, who are asking that Europe remain engaged in the world, committed to development aid and to providing leadership in the fight against climate change and for sustainable development. Listen to the voices of children throughout the world, who say that without the European Union they would be without hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the European governments to listen to the voice of this democratically elected Parliament, which represents Europe’s citizens. I urge them to listen so that we can build a stronger Europe, a Europe of growth and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’.</p>
<p class="contents">At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together. </p>
<p class="contents">The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.</p>

This is the question which appears to be uppermost in the minds of the European governments today. It is a shameful ‘race to the bottom’, with no discussion of the tasks on the European Union’s agenda. It is as if the European budget were a zero-sum game: what I give to you, I lose, and what you win, I lose. </p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of companies from the net contributors operating in the cohesion countries, investing and creating jobs but also earning income, but this is conveniently ignored. It is not a zero-sum game, it is a united Europe to which we should be committed. It is a Europe with a specific agenda to fulfil. The President has pointed out that we should not only be talking numbers, we should also talking tasks, and I am grateful to him for that. That is what the Commission President has done. Mr Barroso, I encourage you to maintain your fighting spirit! If you keep fighting, we will have you firmly on our side and then, together, we will achieve a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask the Council this. What about Europe’s numerous young unemployed? How are they supposed to manage without Europe’s assistance? Is that the message we want to send out to them? Should we scale down successful programmes like Erasmus? Is that how we should prepare for the mobility that is required? Should research funding, which is already in short supply, be cut back even further? Is that our contribution to competitiveness? Should a European budgetary straitjacket now be introduced in parallel to the national budget restraint and the credit crunch? Let me make the point that we did not create the debt; it was the individual Member States that did that. Is this our contribution to growth? </p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso has already mentioned international solidarity, and especially our solidarity towards neighbouring countries. Are these concepts merely empty words? I would ask the foreign ministers to remain silent next time if they are not prepared to follow their words with action and financial assistance. </p>
<p class="contents">Have we set excessively high targets for development cooperation? We said that this is a policy area that Europe can now deal with, so national budgets can be reduced, but now cuts are being called for at the European level as well. That is the policy approach being advocated here. It is a policy that lacks courage. Yes, we need to make savings, but why are we not seeing the heads of government making savings in relation to the establishment of the European patent court, for example? Apparently, the court now needs three separate sites! What is more, Mr Cameron, the economiser-in-chief, is determined to host one of these sites in London! That has nothing to do with restraint!</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we not generating funds where there is scope to do so, for example through more efficient measures to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance? The approach adopted here is one of extreme caution, but if tackled properly, it would yield enough funding for the European and the national budgets. </p>
<p class="contents">We should not confuse thriftiness with a lack of courage. In the European Parliament, we – my group and many fellow Members – are prepared to make savings. However, we also have the courage to commit to the tasks that lie ahead. We are not simply making demands; we want to play our part. That is not always popular here in the House, but we have the courage to do so. Let me say this to the members of the Council: we also have the courage to say ‘no’ when we are presented with bad compromises. We are prepared to vote for compromises, but not bad ones. The Council needs to understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much more that I would like to say about the budget, but in response to recent events, I would also like to touch upon an issue which is causing us grave concern and which, perhaps, has an – albeit indirect – connection with the budget, namely the situation in Gaza. I think we would all be willing to contribute larger sums of money from our budgets if this helped to offer the people in Palestine, especially in the Gaza Strip, a brighter future, indeed, any future at all. </p>
<p class="contents">We would all like to see Israel pursuing policies which give more scope and leeway to the Gaza Strip and release it from the present stranglehold. However, let me make one thing very clear, and I say this quite deliberately: Hamas must stop targeting civilians in Israel at last. This is not helping the people of Gaza, it does not promote peace, and it does not give us Europeans any possibility of bringing influence to bear on Israel and encouraging it to pursue different policies at last, and by that I mean policies which would be beneficial to people in this region. </p>
<p class="contents">We want to help the people in the region, and international aid and the assistance from the European Union are essential here. Every day, we see new conflicts emerging in the world around us, and then these same heads of government and foreign ministers want to make cuts. Let me say this: I hope that the Egyptians will have the chance to help build peace, and by that I mean peace in the region, where peace is so urgently needed. That would also give Europe the opportunity to bring influence to bear, together with Egypt, and encourage Israel to pursue policies which give fresh prospects to the people of Palestine. However, Hamas should abandon its senseless policy of targeting civilians. That is something we cannot tolerate. That should be the clear message sent out from this sitting of the European Parliament today. </p>

Yes, we do want to use our budgetary resources so that whatever we build actually remains standing over the long term.

<p class="contents">It is important to make that clear, but we should not draw a veil over the other aspect. For me, that means sending a clear signal to Hamas.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span>– Mr President, six years ago Tony Blair, who was then the President of the Council, when presenting the multiannual financial framework for 2006–2012 said in this House ‘never again must we repeat the negotiations on this framework in the same way’. But here we are again still talking about the same budget, a budget of more or less 1 % of Europe’s GDP, and we are still dealing with reluctant Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">The only difference now is that Mr Blair has been replaced by Mr Cameron and that the Labour Party is led now by Mr Edward Miliband who a few weeks ago – for purely populist reasons – made a coalition with the Europhobes of the Conservative Party to make a deal on the EU budget even more difficult, if not impossible. So there we are for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not talk about the details of this budget, but let me be very blunt: the whole debate on a little bit more or a little bit less than 1 % of the European GDP is completely ridiculous. First of all, the budgets of Member States like Germany and France are eight to 10 times bigger than the European budget. In recent years they have increased faster than the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget is EUR 140 billion. Do you know what the total budgets of all the Member States of the European Union are? EUR 6 300 billion, EUR 6.3 trillion, that is 50 times bigger than the European budget of EUR 140 billion. The daily contribution of citizens to the European budget is 67 cents a day; that is less than a cup of coffee or, for Mr Callanan, less than a cup of tea.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the United States, the federal budget is 24 % of GDP. Switzerland is a confederation and has a budget of 12 % of GDP, and we cannot agree on 1 %. The European budget is smaller than the budget of smaller Member States like Belgium or Austria. I have the latest figures here: between 2000 and 2010 national budgets in the EU increased by 62 %, that is more or less twice as much as the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to make a real federal European Union, which we will need to do for tomorrow, the least we can say is that 1 % will not be enough in the future. It is a good starting point, but it cannot be the endgame for the future if we want to really tackle the problems. If we want to overcome the euro crisis or if we want to have a general union, we will need more.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, cuts in the European budget are seen in many of our Member States, and certainly in Britain, as the way to solve their budgetary problems. But the opposite is true. A strong European budget is the only way to overcome the budgetary problems of the Member States: pooling money at European level instead of wasting money at the national level. We have to be very firm on this, and politically this Parliament has to be ready to block a deal if it does not correspond to what was proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we are also dealing with a sovereign debt crisis, a political crisis, an institutional crisis, and, increasingly, a crisis in the public’s acceptance of the European Union as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the next common budget for 2014-2020 so crucial for the future of Europe’s citizens? The answer is this: because it must express something that hopefully still exists, namely the shared European will to build a better future; in other words, a European commitment or a <span class="italic">volonté générale européenne</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">From my perspective, David Cameron has simply got it wrong. His logic is that the United Kingdom must make savings, so Europe must do so too, and to the same extent. However, this shows a complete failure to understand that there must be joint investment if we want to invest sustainably in the coming years and genuinely invest in the future. China, India and Brazil will not stand and wait. We have to act together if we genuinely want to assert our citizens’ interests. It is also a false argument, because the fact is that during the period from 2007 to 2013, the European budget grew by just 1.95 %, compared with much larger increases in all the national budgets. This is disproportionate if we genuinely want to press ahead with resolute European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate a point made by previous speakers. We are not acting out of egotistical institutional self-interest. This is not about more money for its own sake. It is about securing the additional funding that we need to offer our citizens a better future. It is about generating new competitiveness in the European Union, and ensuring that there is no repetition of the mistakes made in the past, with the bubbles in Spain and elsewhere. It is about genuine and sustainable growth. It is about research and development. It is about sustainable, future-oriented investment. It is about combating youth unemployment, supporting the transformation of our energy systems, promoting technologies and products that reduce our carbon footprint, supporting organic farming, refurbishing the existing building stock, developing the literacy skills of many people in Europe, and investing in our creative industries, which often create more jobs than other sectors. It is about education, education, education, so it is about Erasmus, but it is also about the European film industry, for example. I mention this because we have the award of the LUX Prize later.</p>
<p class="contents">When Chancellor Merkel spoke to us two weeks ago, she made the following error in my view. She said that 27 Member States had agreed, jointly, to invest 3 % in research and development. This same lady is the leader of a coalition of net contributors in the Council, and their proposals to the Cyprus Presidency include a full 12 % reduction in R&amp;D. This is political schizophrenia! This is not coherence; it is blindness towards the future. The European Parliament rejects this policy and these proposals from Cyprus and Chancellor Merkel, and does so by a large majority!</p>
<p class="contents">We must show that we are resolute in our commitment to shared investment. Of course, we need to answer the question of where the funds should come from, if not from contributions based on GDP, which, as Mr Verhofstadt has reiterated, is no longer a viable model. It causes major conflicts and results in an approach to negotiations which, in essence, aims to push everything down to the lowest level. That is why the introduction of the financial transaction tax and other new sources of own resources is crucially important. It will give us more political autonomy, more shared interests, and is also a justice issue. The banks must contribute to covering the costs of the crisis. We cannot simply carry on pumping money into the banks. They must take on a share of social responsibility and contribute to the European budget. That is why Commissioner Lewandoski’s proposal, his model for the financial transaction tax – with two-thirds going to the European budget, and one-third to the national budgets – is a very good model and creates positive incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we must combat tax avoidance because Europe’s citizens rightly regard it as extremely unfair if those who are unwilling to pay, including the wealthy in Greece, are not pursued and made to pay their share. That is something that we should no longer accept. This is a social justice issue and we need to take action here.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is this. We are only willing to support a genuine agreement if the level of funding is truly in line with what is needed to perform our future agenda, and if there is more flexibility within the budget, as well as genuine own resources. If the Council does not show substantial movement here, we are prepared to say no, and we will do so – let me say it again – not out of egotistical self-interest but in the interests of Europe’s citizens!</p>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there is a substantial need for reform in our agricultural policy.

We reject the knee-jerk response of most of the people in this Chamber that the solution to every problem that we have in Member States is somehow ‘more Europe’. So, increasingly, does public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to President Barroso that he and many other people in this Chamber have argued that the EU budget is there to promote economic growth. We have heard a lot of glib talk from all sides of this Chamber that it is an investment budget. If it was, perhaps on this side of the House we might support more bits of it, because nobody actually believes that it is an investment budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is an investment budget, how come 40 % of it is still spent on subsidies for farmers? What about the 6 % of the budget that is for administration costs? That is not about investment for growth either. Eight Member States – not just the UK – wrote to President Barroso saying that the EUR 2 billion cost of pensions for EU civil servants in the future was unaffordable and that reform was required. You completely ignored that letter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, how can you insist – and how can the rest of you insist – that we need more spending and more money at an EU level? Five per cent of the existing budget, according to the Court of Auditors, is either spent illegally or irregularly – something like EUR 5 billion. If that money was accounted for properly, if the Commission got its expenditure controls in place, then that would take up almost all of the increase that you are all asking for.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us ask about some of the existing projects. Is that all money well spent? How has doubling the number of EU agencies in the last eight years affected growth across Europe? What about the new ECB building in Frankfurt that cost several hundred million euros? How is that going to contribute to more growth in Greece? And what about our presence here in Strasbourg? That costs EUR 200 million a year. How is that contributing to growth in Member States? It is not, of course. Nobody seriously believes that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the EU is not short of money. It just spends the money that it has very, very badly. Let us be quite clear about this. To meet your demands for more spending, virtually every contributing Member State is going to have to borrow that extra money. They are going to have to cut their public expenditure in order to send more money to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely unsustainable, it is unhelpful, and many Member States will not stand for it. Can you seriously, in all good conscience, ask those Member States to borrow that extra money to make cuts at home so that we can all spend more money here in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the EU to spend the money that it already has better so that it creates growth in national economies. Instead of demanding yet more money, why not take the time to go through the existing budget, line by line, asking yourself whether this item of expenditure really results in more economic growth in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just Conservatives who are saying these things, Mr Swoboda. Even some of the socialists, I am pleased to say, are starting to see the light. The UK socialists actually want a cut in the budget, not just a freeze, which is Mr Cameron’s position. They voted in the House of Commons for a cut. And what about your great, latter-day socialist hero, President Hollande? He fought an election – remember that? – on an end to austerity. What is he saying now? He said last week that ‘we must be ready to do better by spending less’. That is the great socialist hero that you tell us is setting an example for the rest of Europe to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a word about new Member States. I think that enlargement has been one of the EU’s great success stories. I think that we have to accept that it will cost more money to support those Member States whose infrastructure was neglected in their communist past. That is why I believe that cohesion spending for new Member States should be maintained, even within an overall freeze or a cut in the multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to do that is through budgetary reform, so that cohesion policy is limited to helping those countries that need it most. It is ridiculous that 40 % of current structural and cohesion funding goes to the EU’s richest countries. Countries like my own should be freed to support our poor regions ourselves without funnelling the money through the inefficient mechanism of the EU budget. I agree with the proposals put forward by our previous socialist government that cohesion policy should be repatriated to the richer Member States and that money only be used to fund the poorer Member States who deserve that spending.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a bit of an optimist. I believe that a better budget – not just a bigger budget – is still achievable in the summit this week. I hope that Member States, with good grace and goodwill, will sit down and agree that we need better EU spending and not just more EU spending.</p>

If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’. No, I am not making it up.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the British public are angry at the fleets of chauffeur-driven cars, at the extravagant buildings and the never-ending travelling circus that is the European Parliament. We pay GBP 53 million a day to be a member of this organisation for no benefit whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cameron, when you come back from this Brussels summit, why do you not accept my challenge and let us have a proper full debate on Britain and whether it is worth staying a member of this Union or not. The last opinion polls over the weekend show that, by a majority of two to one, the British people now want us to leave this Union and not to pay you a penny piece.</p>

In my view, given the critical situation facing the European Union, what you are doing is simply engaging in smear tactics. I think it is unworthy of the House that speeches of this nature are being delivered here, when we have so little opportunity to rein you in.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that you are genuinely representing the interests of the citizens of the United Kingdom when you unleash this kind of attack on the European Union and ultimately indulge in nothing more than nationalistic rhetoric and smear tactics. </p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry, but from my perspective, the situation is far too serious for that. Today, I heard a speech by Mr Barroso which I could actually agree with in many respects for the first time, although I noted the undertone, namely that this was a speech born out of desperation. It was a speech delivered against the backdrop of what is likely to happen at the summit over the last few days. Will our political leaders finally realise that they are the ones who are responsible for the functioning and, indeed, the survival and the future of the European Union, and that they need to find some common ground and take the important decisions that are needed?</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that what has been submitted to us as the proposals for the budget, for the multiannual financial framework, will not help to strengthen the Union’s cohesion. The fact is that the current proposals are all based on drastic budget cuts. You are wrong when you say that what is being demanded here is an increase. Ultimately, what the Commission is additionally proposing merely balances out the extra tasks that have been assigned to the European Union and the challenges that the European Union is prepared to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, no more money is being spent on administration or, indeed, on anything else, and it is quite simply a false argument to claim, as you do every time, that we need to make savings and focus on better spending first and foremost. If there are no resources available for better spending, your arguments fall wide of the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask you this: how is the European Union meant to continue its campaign against poverty and social exclusion in future, for example, if the current proposals for the European budget for 2014-2020 already envisage a reduction in the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, as they most certainly do? In de facto terms, this is a cut. You cannot simply say that what happens during the crisis in the European Union leaves you cold, when more and more people are falling into abject poverty and their livelihoods are at risk. You cannot say, ‘Oh well, Great Britain is 10 times more important to us’ in the belief that you can prevent this crisis from impacting on the most deprived people in your country as well. At that point, you will find that you are relying on European solidarity once again: and that means the solidarity that you are dragging through the mud today. Let me make that very clear. </p>
<p class="contents">I urge you – and I urge the German Government as well – to abandon this position, which erodes solidarity, and to give up these blocking tactics. By its actions, the Council is turning itself into a useless institution, and it will destroy the European Union unless different positions are adopted here at last, and by that I mean positions which have nothing to with narrow-minded, mean-spirited and nationalistic interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public opinion should know that the EU budget is always balanced without deficit. Member States make cuts in order to prevent or curtail deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this budget is, all but for six percent of administrative costs, a growth budget. Funds for agriculture, cohesion, research and innovation and Erasmus, are destined to be returned to the Member States with added value. It is hypocritical to talk about growth and, at the same time, target these guaranteed growth funds. Those who at least speak of more Europe must see this antithesis. This is the first message for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message has to do with the image of Europe. All the disappointment of the European citizens because of the euro crisis cannot withstand an impasse on the budget in the multiannual financial framework. All governments that believe in Europe must realise that neither can the friends of cohesion get as much aid as they would have wished, nor can the net contributors insist on the cuts they initially planned. As always, consensus must prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Parliament reserves this right, provided for in the Treaties, if governments have abandoned any consideration of the common good fenced behind respective national interests.

The budget corresponds to only about 2 % of European public expenditure; it has been falling as a proportion of the Member States’ economies for years and contrary to what Mr Callanan and Mr Farage believe, the main criticism from the Court of Auditors is not against the European institutions but on how EU money is handled by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States who fight for cuts are the strongest ones; the ones who can pay if they feel that the Union is worth defending. No, it is not about money; this is a fight over the European model and the future of Europe. The reason why we Social Democrats, together with a huge majority of Parliament, defend the budget even in times of crisis is that the budget is the most significant expression of our fundamental policies. It is about European and even global solidarity. It is about creating a European added value and the basic idea that the growth we are striving for is not just any growth but is based on the principle of economic, social and environmental sustainability, is about green jobs and smart and inclusive growth.</p>
<p class="contents">These are fundamental things which will not be funded without the European Union. Let me mention just a few examples. Who will fund the completion of the single market including a modern cross-border transport energy and digital infrastructure if not the EU budget? Who will start breaking the vicious circle of austerity if we do not do it together? Who will provide the contribution to the innovative financial instruments including project bonds for funding investments? I mean, with all the restrictions on national budgets, on banks and financial institutions, only the European Union can do it. How can we respect our commitment to funding the Millennium Development Goals if not through the EU budget?</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that Member States under pressure will not even fulfil their commitments to allocate 0.7 % of GNI to development aid. We need the European Union for that. Against the background of new devastating research on the effects of climate change no Member State is big enough to mitigate climate change on its own. We must do it together and the European Union is the major global actor in this field. Even if some of us do not like common agricultural policies we must ask: who will finance the greening of agriculture and the greening of fisheries and the more sustainable development of those policies if we do not do it together? So this is not about money; it is about giving the European Union the chance to finally realise the role we all agreed on in the Lisbon Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore run the risk that, during the negotiations in the coming days, we will de-prioritise common, forward-thinking investment in research, education, transport and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most exciting proposals that the Commission has come up with is a fund for investment in transport and energy, the Connecting Europe facility. I think it is important to defend this newly-created investment opportunity. Mr Daul has mentioned that the Baltic States have good railway links to Moscow. They clearly should have, because we will not have a railway that links them to the rest of Europe if there is no money in the Connecting Europe facility.</p>
<p class="contents">The resources side of things risks becoming even more Byzantine and complicated than it is at present, and we do not need that. We need in the future to have a simple, fair and transparent system for the EU’s own resources, without any special rules and rebates, and for its part my group will place a very, very great amount of emphasis on having a binding plan for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore up to all of us to continue to move forward. However, the budgetary proposals from the Cypriot Presidency and the President of the Council for the period 2014-2020 will do nothing but stop this progress in its tracks and backpedal, which would be disastrous for our future.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the crisis, Parliament proposed maintaining the 2007-2013 budget amounts, only increasing them for the foreseeable effects of the new elements in the next budget period: accession of a 28<span class="sup">th</span> Member States and application of the new EU competences following on from the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed a lower amount, based on the current budget amounts, arguing that the savings imposed by the economic situation had to be used to finance the extension of the Union’s tasks. That proposal is compatible with the European idea, given that we have to tighten our belts because of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposals by the Cypriot Presidency and then Mr Herman Van Rompuy completely contradict the very principle of moving forward with European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This conciliation is Eurosceptic because in the Council there is a political surrender to the blackmail of the most Eurosceptic countries. Our position in this Parliament is simple, however. Since Mr Cameron is threatening to use his right of veto, we would point out that the European Parliament also has a right of veto <span class="italic">in fine</span> on the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not hesitate to ask our parliamentary colleagues to use that right of veto to obstruct the Council’s political resignation. Negotiations are starting. No one should forget that these are negotiations between 28 partners and that the European Parliament will have the last word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The article is entitled ‘The European Parliament pours more money into celebrating itself’ and it appeared two days ago. So if anyone here wants to talk about the budget, it should first of all be the European Parliament which sets an example and shows that it knows how to make savings, when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to be credible, please let us stop our eternal travelling between Brussels and Strasbourg and save EUR 200 million annually, let us abandon the absurd projects, like the monument to ideological propaganda called the House of European History, and save another EUR 50 million. Let us abolish the European Parliament Information Offices in all the Member States’ capital cities, I do not know why they are there. I do not know why we have an Information Office in Washington. Perhaps we think we are a little bit like the American Congress? You can see that, if we take these steps, money will be saved. This is what we are talking about when we say we want <span class="italic">better spending</span>. Instead of setting an example, we hear Mr Daul, we hear Mr Verhofstadt, calling for confrontation, looking for conflict and looking for someone to accuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the way forward. If Parliament were to block any agreement, it would only make a fool of itself and I think that our reputation with the public is already bad enough, without agreeing to anything like that. Mr Schulz, if you are a responsible President of the European Parliament, you will not go down the road of confrontation, you will go down the road of compromise, try to find agreement and help the European Parliament not to make a fool of itself and set out on the journey proposed by, for example, Mr Daul or Mr Verhofstadt, because that is a journey to nowhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget is about choices, in particular policy choices. We want choices that involve cohesion and solidarity. Although the following issues have already been mentioned several times, they are worth repeating: what will become of the Erasmus Programme? What will become of scientific research? What will become of investment to create jobs, if the Council’s proposal is adopted? What will become of the funds to support the poorest and most vulnerable in Europe? I must also ask: where in all this is the courage to resolutely implement a financial transactions tax? Where is the courage to ditch economic macro-conditionality and the restrictions of the Fiscal Compact? At a time when we need more and better Europe, our governments are effectively digging the grave of the Europe that they claim to be defending. For the sake of the present and future, the citizens of Europe will never forgive us if this Parliament and the Commission yield to this Council proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the heads of state will meet to discuss the budget for the coming years. That decision is rightly theirs too, it is not a decision for Parliament or the Commission. The Member States foot the bills, so they also take the decisions. It is important to reiterate that, as most of those here forget it sometimes. I would like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Mavroyiannis, who has made a good start on expenditure restraint.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, the Netherlands, wants to do more though and is prepared to use its veto if more substantial cuts are not made to the proposed multiannual budget. Similar messages are coming out from the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Austria. Luckily we have that veto, because if the citizens were left to the mercy of the Commission and Parliament, this unbridled spending of their money would simply carry on night and day. The proposals made by Mr Mavroyiannis and Mr Van Rompuy are a start, but we could shave several tens of billions more off the budget. The situation where the north-west pays and the south-east squanders the money must be consigned to the past. This completely misplaced solidarity must stop as soon as possible. Certain countries clearly need to learn that when it comes to budgets it is not about solidarity, but solidity.</p>
<p class="contents">On another point, Mr Swoboda, not a cent more should go to Gaza and Hamas, whose aim is to destroy Israel. Let the government of Gaza look after its own people for once, instead of European citizens having to pay for the rockets that threaten that state’s independence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Building on the Cyprus Presidency’s negotiating boxes, President Van Rompuy has now presented a negotiating box, so we have some movement, but in a direction which follows the Council’s logic, namely that further cuts are the simplest and the only solution, without sufficient regard for the consequences and without adequate consideration of the proposals that we have made. This is a shame, to say the least, and is increasingly looking like a missed opportunity for an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me clarify, if I may: we are in favour of better spending as well. We are in favour of structural reforms and, in the interim report, we make very specific proposals on this issue, because it is essential to talk about synergies and the avoidance of duplication in our work, but it is also essential to discuss aspects of subsidiarity intensively and try to establish clarity. Unfortunately, though, there are some Member States that regard the European budget as nothing but a cancerous tumour. As a result, many of the accusations being made lack any substance or rationale, and this is poisoning everything. If the European budget for 2008-2013 increased by 1.95 % annually, then we are doing very well: the figure for Germany was close to 2.5 % per annum, for France, it was almost 2.8 %, the figure for the Netherlands was 2.8 %, for Austria it was almost 3 %, Sweden was close to 2.9 %, and 2.5 % for the United Kingdom. We can certainly hold our own in the competition for stability and serious budget policies. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have delivered a good speech, but I urge you to remain steadfast in the meeting with the European Council. Do not let them soften you up! I would like to voice a plea to the European Council. Please do not waste this opportunity to make proposals to Parliament that we can support with an absolute majority. Please give the Cypriot Presidency an adequate and flexible negotiating mandate so that we can achieve a sensible result by the end of the year, and by that I mean a result which takes our priorities on board. Let us be clear: as it stands, the Van Rompuy proposal is not a solution and will not secure the support of the European Parliament. In enhancing these negotiating boxes, please do not try to palm us off with token gestures! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That position has nothing in common with what was subsequently proposed by the Presidency, and with Mr Van Rompuy’s position in particular. It is unacceptable for the European Parliament in its present form. Once again we are witnessing the European Council turning the discussion on the budget into an exercise in accounting, into a zero-sum game in which one has to win and another has to lose. This is not what the European budget is about. What Parliament is fighting for is an instrument for policies that are already determined. Who has determined these policies? The European Council itself. The same leaders who are now refusing to provide the finances to implement them. Who took the decision in June for a Compact for Growth and Jobs, which was supposed to be supported with EUR 150 billion? European leaders. Who took the decision and told young people that they will have more opportunities for free movement and training in Europe? European leaders. Who is promising developing countries that if they open their markets they will receive additional assistance? European leaders. Who is committing to fighting climate change? European leaders. We have made enough commitments. Their implementation, however, requires the corresponding budget. Therefore, when we talk about the budget we have to talk about the policies that have already been decided.</p>
<p class="contents">Here the English Conservatives, our colleagues, are concerned about English taxpayers and rightly so. Do they tell British taxpayers, however, how much English universities earn from the mobility of young people? How much English businesses gain from the common market, from common infrastructure? How many British researchers and scientists take part in common European projects? How many British companies spend public investment from the European budget? This is the other side of the truth that taxpayers should also be told. Let us really ask our regions, those in the developed, in the less developed, and in the most under-developed regions; if there are no European funds there are no public investments. That is a fact. If we limit them even further that would mean that the European budget does not solve the economic crisis but actually aggravates it. We do not want the European budget to be a procyclical measure. Furthermore, Parliament is equally opposed to it, i.e. to the macroeconomic conditionality that some Member States seek. Let us ask the non-governmental organisations working in the developing countries how many jobs are created in Europe and how much European companies themselves profit from the assistance for growth we give to developing countries. That is the other side of the coin.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must take a decision on the European Council decision. I believe that if the European Council does not take into consideration our demands, there is no way that we could support such a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negotiations in the past were all extremely difficult too, but we always managed to find a compromise. Parliament has always adopted very reasonable positions. The problem, I think, is always with the Council. In the previous period and in the period we are in now, we have always made very clear agreements with the Council on better implementation of the budget. We have made agreements on accounting for the expenditure. The Court of Auditors is really taking things too far by issuing negative statements of assurance all the time. Most of these agreements have not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">We also made clear agreements about flexibility in the budget in the last period, something that Parliament finds necessary again this time. The Council has not complied with most of the agreements on flexibility. One of the things we need is to strengthen this in the new budget. It is so ridiculous that money is paid back to the Member States every year, and the Member States then complain that the bills that come in are far too high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words about the Council proposal. It is very much reduced; it is certainly better than the British proposal, but in relation to the Commission proposal, it is lower in all cases, even though – as we heard – the European budget only represents 2 % of the Member States’ spending. Is proposing that they give even less really going to take the strain off the national budgets? By giving less, will the national budgets really be better off?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course not! It is far from being the case, and will be even less so when we make progress on own resources. In this case, the Council will have to explain to the European citizens what projects can be supported when we have to make cuts across the board. It will have to explain that the Europe 2020 strategy is perhaps only window dressing, that research and innovation are a luxury, that economic regeneration in our regions will have to cope with fewer resources for cohesion. Good luck explaining all of that!</p>
<p class="contents">Good luck, too, explaining to the Europeans who still believe in the European project that that is how we are going to finance solidarity with the East, which we must do. Good luck explaining how we are going to finance solidarity with southern Europe, which we must do. Good luck to the net contributors as well! Do you think that the northern countries will behave better because of this reduction? Of course they will not. They all have an interest in seeing an improvement in the economies of their neighbouring countries. Indeed, it seems that British employers and European employers realised this at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p class="contents">You can ask a great deal of Parliament and we have done a huge amount of work in the Committee on Budget to really try to get a good, solid proposal. We want to be flexible, to revisit certain things, but you cannot ask us to go below the Commission’s proposal. Parliament will say no to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council also has to be aware of the fact that, although there will be 27 of them at the discussions and they have to reach an agreement, there is a 28<span class="sup">th</span> partner here, which is not prepared to accept a proposal that is lower than the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To what extent there will be investment in our shared development, in rapid growth for the European Union, and to what extent it will be a budget of stagnation, a budget that reinforces the differences between individual European Union Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable, ladies and gentlemen, that we should be talking today about potential cuts to the budget, about the budget amount. That is natural and entirely justified. However, far less attention is being paid, here and in the public sphere, to how the proposals on the negotiating table could prevent, weaken and restrict the future absorption of EU funding by European Union Member States. I am talking, here, about the end to VAT eligibility, about macro-economic conditionality, which will determine the absorption of EU funding. I am talking about capping, about the system of net corrections for projects, which means that, contrary to what is stated in the current financial perspective, future projects not subject to European Union supervision will be rejected by Brussels and have their funding returned to the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must ask ourselves today whether the restrictive arrangements and rules included in the negotiating proposals that will be discussed tomorrow in Brussels do not simply serve to restrict the future absorption of EU funding under the new financial perspective. If that is the case, both new and old Member States should seriously consider substantially toning down these proposals and, failing that, countries such as Poland should simply exercise their right of veto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, we all know where we stand today. Budgeting is not a field where the EU can claim success.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we putting more money into agricultural funding that amounts, at present, to over 40 % of the budget? We are paying for farmers not to grow food, although the market is there. Have the billions paid out in structural funds to countries like Greece, Portugal or Spain stemmed the crisis there? No, they have not. If there was a serious will to use the budget to develop Europe’s economy, a major rethink would have taken place many years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, every year we are asked to top up the same old budget lines. The EU budget for the 2014-2020 period should be reduced drastically to allow Member States to decide where they want to put their taxpayers’ money. The UK should not only veto an increase, but should demand a significant reduction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) nuclear fusion project and the European satellite system programmes, including the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Galileo navigation systems are expensive projects, but, as I repeatedly say in this forum, even accepting the need for targeted expenditure of European money, I do not fully understand why we cannot recognise the need for budget financing for key investment programmes. Why do we cast doubt on our credibility and the Union’s undertakings towards its partners? If we do not, despite all the difficulties, support these exceptional projects now, it may be that we shall never take the vital step, never have the opportunity again. In my view, ITER, GMES and Galileo might make a contribution to solving the energy problems in Europe and have the potential to provide much needed employment.

Do you want to reduce everything to a minimum and freeze the future? And is this the same Europe that will supposedly be relaunched with Mr Van Rompuy’s document on integration? Where is the consistency between Mr Van Rompuy’s two policy documents? Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions?</p>
<p class="contents">These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent.

Why? Because our socialists, our Scottish Nationalists and our Green colleagues engaged in a crass act of political cross-dressing by joining the Eurosceptic UKIP camp and voting for deeper cuts in that vote. Can I say to them I think you need to be careful who you climb into bed with? You could be the ushers who unwittingly took the UK through the exit door.</p>

They reflect the tough economic times our constituents are facing on a daily basis and they could be the basis of an agreement. However, I am deeply disappointed at Mr Van Rompuy’s plans reduce Parliament’s flexibility to manage the budget more effectively. Parliament has made it crystal clear to the Council that a tougher budget must go hand in hand with greater flexibility, not less, a genuine mid-term review and prioritising spending on the EU 2020 objectives.

As we meet here today in Strasbourg, Baltic farmers who have gathered for a meeting in Brussels say that Europe is insulting us and taking us for fools by allocating us payments that are four times lower. How long can this go on? We talk about a level playing field in all resolutions and directives so let us finally create one.</p>
<p class="contents">Lithuania undertook to decommission the nuclear power plant and has done so. The European Union undertook to finance its decommissioning but has not done this fully. Three times less money than is needed is to be earmarked for the decommissioning of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant until 2017, while the further decommissioning, which may last until 2029 at the earliest, is not to be financed. I would like to stress that this is clear backsliding from the Treaty of Accession and the provisions contained in its Protocol No 4. In legal terms this may be seen as a violation of the Treaty of Accession.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the various tasks on the agenda have also been correctly and precisely identified. On the other hand, there is this competition, as I think Mr Swoboda called it, among the Member States to see who can save the most. I am not entirely sure whether this is the right way forward or the right kind of rhetoric at this difficult, indeed critical time. I could stand here and give a speech explaining why all this is important. However, I believe that we also have a responsibility to consider how we can find some common ground. What is the best way of moving forward so that we can reach an agreement, ideally in the next few days? The fact is that if European policy-makers fail to reach agreement at such a critical time, this will not only determine whether we have enough funds flowing into our budget. It will also have a wider impact on the markets, politics, and other countries. That is why I believe there is no alternative: we must give some thought to the steps that we need to take to move towards some common ground. </p>
<p class="contents">President Schulz said at the start that Parliament is showing movement on this issue and will continue to do so. It was a brief comment but in my view, it was a very clever one. The resolution before us shows that we are already thinking about how we can move towards common ground. It is not the case that all our spending in every area is essential and must be maintained at all costs. As with the national parliaments, there is bound to be some leeway. Questions like ‘how much’ and ‘which items’ are the really interesting questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer not to argue about the amount of money we receive and whether this should be a bit more or a bit less. I would prefer to discuss which tasks should be on the agenda and how much money we will need for them. Which tasks could be dispensed with, perhaps? Which processes can we look at critically? Is it always the right way forward for the stakeholders concerned – I am thinking of the agricultural sector, for example – if we simply hand out more cash and impose more conditions? It might, perhaps, be more sensible to impose fewer conditions, for this could result in more sparing use of funds in one area or another as well. </p>
<p class="contents">A compromise means that both sides have to show some movement. We will consider where we can make some concessions. It is not just about austerity in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children </p>
<p class="contents">The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists.

<p class="contents">Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise.

The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are no longer any resources for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or food aid for the most deprived.

<p class="contents">Yes, it is an unquestionable fact that we are facing a crisis. However, many – the vast majority – would say that, if we are going to survive this crisis, we will not do it alone. We must act together, we must achieve a synergy effect, we must strengthen our Union, we must have more Europe in order to be able to tackle the crisis effectively. I would point out to Mr Mavroyiannis that we cannot have more Europe or a stronger European Union for less money. That is simply not possible. Mr Kasoulides made this point earlier, as did the Polish Prime Minister at the European People’s Party Congress in Bucharest. More Europe means more money. How should that money be spent? President Barroso has talked about that. The EU budget is an investment budget that can deliver more jobs and economic growth and help those areas lagging behind, in particular the new Member States – countries like Poland. Poland serves as an example of just how effectively this money can be used; of how European assistance can generate economic growth and jobs and help the European economy – not only the Polish economy, but the European economy as well. That is why I call on Mr Mavroyiannis (and, through him, on President Van Rompuy) to accept that there is no more room for cuts. Meanwhile, I would like to congratulate President Barroso on his outstanding speech today and to urge him to defend the budget presented by the Commission – a good budget – with the same passion, determination and persistence at the summit tomorrow and the day after. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is that really what David Cameron wants? Does he really want to relegate Britain to the second division? Well, if that is what he wants, he has almost achieved it; and for what? Does he really think that it is in the British interest? Of course he does not, but rather he is fearful of taking on those in his party who would head us to the exit door.

That is why it is crucial to preserve it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a strong budget and a substantial budget because it is the only lever we have to invest at European level in growth and because it is also the only instruments we have to reduce inequalities between Member States, between regions, between European citizens, and I am thinking, in particular, of the most deprived among us.</p>
<p class="contents">I, therefore, believe that our Parliament has two battles ahead of it: the first is to obtain a budget that responds to the challenges, which are enormous in the current situation; the second – which is at least as important – is to ensure that in future the European budget is no longer a simple variable in the adjustments of the national budgets. We, in the European Parliament, must make every effort to establish an own resource for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President, that this can be recognised and that the Commission’s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council’s proposal goes in the opposite direction. The European Union does not have a deficit or public debt, yet this budget makes it impossible to fulfil the ambitions laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is unfair, it is completely unsupportive, it will increase inequalities and it reflects European fatigue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is bad news for the cohesion policy and, in particular, for the so-called transition regions. It is bad news for the future of the common agricultural policy, which is the heart and soul of the European project and which has an economic, a social and an environmental dimension. However, without money and without resources, not only can there be no common agricultural policy, there can be no reform of it either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a blow to Europe’s future development and cooperation aid abroad, which shows Europe’s best side in the fight to reduce poverty. It is bad news for the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ and for the trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks. It will also curb our ambitions in the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, parliamentarism was first introduced to determine budgets and taxes. That is precisely why this Parliament has the duty to tell the Council in no uncertain terms that it either changes its proposal or this Parliament will have to vote against a budget that makes Europe look bad at the worst possible time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Willmott – I see that she has gone – has a cheek to talk about smashing alliances when her party has sabotaged the chance of rallying round a sensible call for restraint in the EU budget in the form of a freeze.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever fine speeches Mr Ed Miliband now makes, the fact is that British Labour’s hypocrisy has made the situation of British pro-Europeans infinitely worse. It is politically impossible to argue to EU citizens under pressure and losing their jobs that the EU budget should rise. So a freeze is the EU-friendly policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But there must be more flexibility, better targeting of spending for innovation and growth, rather than farm subsidies, and a mid-term review when, hopefully, economies are doing better.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, these have caused difficulty and diminished the democratic dimension of the budget adoption. The MFF approval procedure and codecision oppose rather than complement one another. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Council does not respect the Treaty and proposes elements that should be subject to codecision. The Council and the European Parliament became blocked in the codecision procedure as there were no negotiations on the resources needed to implement European policies. The rotating European Council Presidency submitted one proposal and the President of the Council of the European Union another. This state of affairs and these proposals both undermine the Commission’s proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">In this period of crisis, the Member States are increasing national budget allocations for investment and job creation. This must be mirrored in the European budget, 94 % of which is allocated for investment. The Member States that are net contributors know that one euro invested in one region of Europe will bring benefits in other regions of the Union. Given that public funds were used for the financial bailout, public funds must also be used to support European policies that stimulate economic growth and job creation, and, by implication, financial prosperity. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council of the European Union adopted the Europe 2020 strategy with national and EU targets. The same Council must also ensure an adequate budget to meet these targets. I believe that the members of the Council are hesitating between a populist attitude, whereby they cut budgets, and a push for development, which ensures that the funds will return to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of promoting economic growth and creating jobs, crisis management led to recession and record-breaking unemployment levels. So too, now, the planned large-scale reductions in the Union’s budget would cause further deterioration and widen the development gap. Some policy priorities need to be considered: it is important that the resources in the European Social Fund remain intact so that we can mitigate the serious social and labour market impact of the crisis. We must abide by our values and ensure that there are resources for common refugee policy, for integration of migrants, for supporting fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination. This is all about making a choice: either we put the principle of solidarity into practice and bridge the development gap, or we let the development gap widen further.

In 2011, most of them voted in favour of a draft financial perspective, submitted after a year of budgetary work, which took into account Europe’s traditional policies and new policies, and which provided adequate financing for the European agenda for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, the Commission then presented a very adequate, if less ambitious, proposal, which at that stage took into account the Member States’ wish to reduce as far as possible their national contribution to the common budget. After that, the proposals from Cyprus and Mr Van Rompuy went from bad to worse, with a noticeable downward trend.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, just as the European Council is beginning, we are EUR 100 billion below the European Parliament’s proposal and EUR 75 billion below the Commission’s proposal. With such a precedent, the multiannual financial framework that might emerge from Brussels this week is going to reflect some very worrying realities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that the EU budget is a financial burden, not an instrument of economic policy. The Council refuses to analyse EU spending from the perspective of its European added value. That added value does not exist with this proposal. The Council is sacrificing agriculture and the cohesion policy to a simple calculation of the national net balances. The Horizon 2020 programme will again be worthless without sufficient funding: it will follow the path of the Lisbon strategy. With this proposal, the Council is giving in to the pressure of one Member State whose ambition is outside the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the report on the Cohesion Fund, I must say that the logic behind some of the statements and the proposal of President Van Rompuy is simply shocking. On the one hand, he states that the cohesion policy aims to reduce disparities, but in his proposals, we note the following, which contradict this: a substantial reduction in the cohesion budget, a reduction in the cofinancing rates for the least developed regions of the European Union and, more surprisingly, punishment of the regions with a weaker absorption rate, and, alongside all these, the macroeconomic conditionalities constantly opposed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy and the Council must understand that we cannot forgo the word ‘solidarity’ in Europe and that the European Union cannot exist with a rich, selfish centre and a poor periphery. I would like to remind President Van Rompuy about the role of the cohesion policy and, more importantly, the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator.

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Reducing cohesion support would only make matters worse because it would aggravate economic and social tensions, further undermine political stability and reduce confidence in the institutions of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to cite the example of Hungary, Mr President. Over the past two and a half years the Hungarian government and Hungarian citizens have made strenuous efforts to ensure that the country can at last free itself from the excessive deficit procedure and avoid the risk of having its cohesion funds suspended. As the European Commission’s recent country report confirms, the Hungarian government’s successful crisis management programme has enabled Hungary, for the first time since its accession to the EU, to keep its budget deficit below 3 % for three years running. This result is a success both for the Hungarian people and for Europe. Hungary can at last escape from the blind alley down which previous governments had led it. To do this, however, it also needs the cohesion resources.</p>

Its position is directly opposed to that of the Bureau and to President Van Rompuy’s text. In a time of crisis and austerity programmes in the Member States, the EU multiannual budget may prove to be simultaneously realistic and ambitious, supporting the 2020 strategy, employment, student mobility, research and science, and hence Europe’s position in an extremely competitive world. Mr President, anyone who sets targets must also find the means to achieve them. How can the European leadership deceive itself? How can it adopt an attitude that supports a return to inward-looking nationalism? The European budget must express not only solidarity but also the preservation of the European perspective, because Europe cannot advance into the future on autopilot. Europe needs new endeavours, serious corrections to the mistaken choices of the past, and a genuine unity. Community funding needs to be coordinated at the level of objectives and, therefore, at the level of results. Whether some people like it or not, Europe, whatever its shortcomings, cannot become just a free trade area. A fair compromise, then, on the issue of the multiannual budget will give European citizens a breathing space, because they need real solidarity. The Council must back down immediately and accept the positions expressed today in Parliament, and also those of the Commission, because both bodies are willing to reach a fair compromise for the sake of the citizens, which will strengthen the values of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is the point, when we need growth in Europe, of freezing or even reducing the size of an efficient investment instrument complementing national efforts at a time when the objective is to complete the single market and to increase the competitiveness of all European regions to the North, to the South, to the East and to the West? I believe that it is cohesion policy itself that would get us out of this real, but also psychological, crisis. What is the point in crippling it? What is the point in dividing into friends of cohesion policy and friends of good spending? They both go together. There are government leaders who bravely announce that the multiannual financial framework must be frozen until 2020. Would they have the same courage to declare before their electorate that they will also freeze their national budgets until 2020? Of course it is more popular and more populist to cripple the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We declare that we want growth and jobs, a competitive economy, scientific research and innovations, and yet we purposefully limit the very instruments that achieve them. We are therefore guaranteeing the certain failure of the Europe 2020 objectives, which was, in fact, what happened with the Lisbon Strategy. Do we want to allow it to happen again? The world around us is not waiting. Ladies and gentlemen, government leaders, do not leave the central pillar of solidarity in the European Union, namely the cohesion policy, in such a state that it is unable to fulfil its objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question to be asked is therefore whether we want the European Union to make the difference in this crisis situation or whether we want to aggravate the crisis. Most of the European countries are currently making huge efforts in their public finances so that they can exit the crisis in a competitive position enabling the European Union and its countries to truly compete on a global level. However, it is clear that, without investment, there can be no growth and no exit from this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union insists on these radical cuts, particularly in cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy, those countries which are making a huge effort will not grow. As a result, this plan for the European Union, which we have accepted in every country, namely good accounts with prospects of growth and competitiveness, will fail. The only substantial instrument available to achieve this goal is precisely the multiannual financial framework. As a result, if we want the European Union to succeed and its policy to stand as an example to other countries, we must secure the right budget for the financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it has shown very clearly that you really represent European citizens. We participated in many rounds of negotiations. It is not only the two major EU institutions which support the proposal for a modern and a good European budget, but also scientists, students, businessmen and industrialists support a modern European budget. Therefore I think the debate today was very important because it reconfirms this attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to react to some of the myths, which I heard again this morning and which are so misleading and so damaging to the European image.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the notion that national budgets are being cut. There are cuts only in the five Member States which are on the programme. So what is being cut in the Member States? Excessive deficits. I think we have to speak about the figures but, to be fair to each other, we have to use them correctly. I think that Mr Böge in his statement was very precise about that. The budgets in 22 Member States are actually growing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at budget developments over the longer period, from 2000 to 2011, only two Member States have slower-growing budgets than the EU budget. If we take the example of the UK, in that case the budget grew twice as fast as the budget of the European Union. And let us remind ourselves that in 2000 there were only 15 of us. Now we are 27 and very soon we will be 28.</p>
<p class="contents">Then of course there is the issue of errors. I think that it is very important that we do not confuse errors with fraud or abuse. Only 0.2 % of the EU budget is actually investigated and you know very well that the Commission has clean books and a clean budget. Where is there a problem? With improper spending in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I am very glad that yesterday in the General Affairs Council we approved the new approach to the way in which we control and spend the EU budget. We are introducing the possibility of net corrections, so I believe that we should also increase the discipline in how the money is spent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to some of the ridiculous projects which have been mentioned here, let us not assume that they are automatically paid for. More than EUR 1.5 billion worth of projects are very carefully studied and we do not pay for anything which is not in accordance with EU laws and EU rules.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the EU staff – and I have had quite intense discussions on this over the last couple of weeks – we have 55 000 EU officials, which include those in the Council, the European Parliament, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the European External Action Service, delegations abroad, agencies and the two Committees we have in Brussels. So how does this compare with the administrations abroad? They are comparable with the City Council in Birmingham or the City Council of Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we compare the size of the staff of the Commission? I had a discussion on this yesterday with my British friends. One department in the UK, the Department for Public Works and Pensions, is three times bigger than the whole Commission with 98 000 people. Of course we can distinguish the roles of the civil servants in this or that institution, but the fact is that this is one department for one country and we have a Commission which has to serve, already now, 28 countries. Therefore I think we have to keep the figures in proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of pensions, the first thing to say is that EU officials are paying the highest contribution rates in Europe and they are, of course, paying towards their pensions in a system which was developed and proposed by the Member States. They are paying the pensions into the EU budget under the promise that when they reach pensionable age they will get their pension. If there were a pension fund – it was abolished by the Member States – today we would have a pension fund of EUR 35 billion to cover future pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the argument that we did not react to austerity, here again I would like to remind Members that, since 2009, the Commission has followed zero growth with regard to staffing. How have we reacted to austerity? We continued with a proposal of a five % cut with a staff which will have to cover this cut by longer working hours – which would be among the longest in the European Union – without a pay adjustment. We have reacted by introducing the possibility for possibly the longest working life in the EU, namely introducing a pension age of 65 with the possibility to work to 67 and the European Parliament is suggesting 70. Is this not – I would say – a reaction to austerity? I think it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that we are under time constraints, so allow me to conclude by saying that we very much value your support. We are of course ready to engage and we will look for the compromise. But you will also understand that we have to fight for Europe, for the citizens and for a good modern EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know it is only by working together that we will deliver a good and sustainable budget for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken note of the positions expressed during this debate; we are going to convey them to the President of the European Council and through the Council to our Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Far be it for me to challenge or question the intentions of MEPs, albeit diverse and conflicting at times, or for that matter the intentions of this House as a whole. I was particularly heartened about the reminder of the role of the EU budget and the role of Europe in the world and of Heading 4, because indeed we do not live in a glass house.</p>
<p class="contents">However, an agreement on the MFF can only be the synthesis of a shared vision and ambition considering the dire economic realities we are facing. Certainly we should not lower the level of ambition in a way which would deprive us of the means to move forward together honouring our values: quality of life, social cohesion, a redefinition of the notion of modernity and what kind of competitiveness we want; what kind of society we want; what kind of community we want.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the antithesis mentioned by my mentor, Mr Kasoulides, real as it is, there might also be differing views on how to best achieve agreed and coordinated, sought-after results. Nobody in the Council questions Erasmus, help for SMEs, culture, education, research and development. Even with the proposed reductions, there is a substantial increase in comparison with the current period.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not come with a butcher’s cleaver to cut because we enjoy cutting. It is a difficult and painful situation. Let us credit each other with good intentions. Let us credit each other with being good Europeans even if we disagree on the role, the scope and the ambit of the European Union and what should be done at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us try together – but please in a pragmatic way with respect and dignity – to move the limits of what is possible and the quality of our spending, of our policies, of our actions, of our programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Some tell us that we are a weak Presidency because we have upheld these values. We will not change. We will continue to have the same ethical approach assuming fully our responsibility with modesty yet ambition; trying to bring about a big catalyst of change. However, we do not force or impose. This is our role; we are honest brokers. This is our mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Please be conscious that when Member States contributing more than two-thirds of the budget and representing more than half of the EU population are asking for reductions, we cannot just ignore them. What we need is just more persuasion. This is the only way.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed we all – Member States and of course this House as well – have the right of veto. But veto is just the right to pull the plug from the bottom of the boat we are all in, with the certainty that the boat will sink. Therefore, let us replace the threat of veto and the vicious circle with a virtuous one and embark on this by definition cathartic exercise, sticking together in adversity and coming out of it stronger and better off and, at the end of the day, bequeathing a better Europe to future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are, first and foremost, Cyprus’s representative and the representative of the Member States.

However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me make one thing clear: pragmatism and real-world conditions require a larger budget for the European Union, especially for the programmes to combat poverty and social exclusion. It is not acceptable that even the EUR 2.5 billion earmarked for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived could be further reduced by the Member States to just EUR 2 billion or even rejected outright. We must recognise that due to the crisis, the situation of many people in the Member States has worsened and we all have a responsibility to act in solidarity here. That must the first priority for the negotiations next week as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The prerequisite, from my perspective, is that the Council finally accepts that the EUR 9 billion shortfall in the 2012 budget should be signed off and not carried forward to next year, and that no further shortfalls from 2012 should be carried forward to the next Financial Framework, as this would further reduce the total amount available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Farage, let us be honest about it. You are a member of the Committee on Fisheries, for example, and you are never there, never! In 2011, no attendance. In 2012, no attendance. It is fantastic what you are doing. You come here saying that the salaries that are paid are a scandal, and you pay yourself a salary without doing any work in your own committee: that is the reality of the European Union today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You can laugh. I hope that maybe this can be sent out on the BBC this evening, and on all the other private television channels in Britain, showing how you are in fact cheating your own citizens here, all the time, three years in a row already. I think it has to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that Mr Alain Lamassoure is right. This Union, if it wants to become a real federal union, needs own resources; it needs in fact its own income, and that is the big battle now. We shall do it together and, if necessary, without you, Mr Farage.</p>

My comments concern a gentleman who has much more responsibility but who is not present in the chamber today; indeed, he is conspicuous by his absence at so many of our sittings. This gentleman has made a budget proposal and yet he is not willing to come here to defend it. Why is Mr Van Rompuy absent? I have nothing against Mr Mavroyiannis. He is a very pleasant and patient person, but Mr Van Rompuy should be here to defend his budget and his budget cuts. That is important, and would be a crucial debate!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am sure that as always, you will present our views very effectively but it would be very useful to have a direct confrontation for once.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and final comment is this. I know that many leaders and governments are now spreading the rumour that failure to reach agreement at the summit is a crisis for Europe. Let me say this: an agreement on the wrong terms is a crisis for Europe. A budget which cannot fulfil the tasks the EU has set itself is a crisis for Europe. A budget that we cannot endorse is a crisis for Europe. The heads of state and government should not constantly act as if their failure to reach agreement would precipitate a crisis. The crisis will occur if the basis for their agreement is the wrong one, meaning that we cannot fulfil our agenda. I already see one threat looming – and I would like to give you my backing once again, Mr President, also in your statements to the Council – namely that some countries will be mollified by the funding for agriculture and others by the cohesion funding, leaving no room in the European budget for growth and reforms. The danger is that all the countries and heads of government who want an efficient budget, a budget for growth and better spending will be bypassed and what we are left with is less spending. That is something that we cannot accept. That is not a course that will benefit Europe, and we must reject it. We must also send out a clear message that this type of budget will not secure the approval of the majority of Members of this House. </p>

We are willing to compromise. However, there are limits to our willingness to compromise. Of course, we know that shortfalls in the management of the European budget must be resolutely addressed by the Commission and the Member States. We must get this under control. We want to achieve a result in the time available, but we do not want a result at any price. Quality must take precedence over timetabling.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it very clear at this juncture that the proposal made by Mr Van Rompuy, as a concept, is certainly not capable of securing majority support in the House.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">More far-reaching ideas that apparently exist, which involve further cuts and reductions in programmes that offer European added value, are doomed to failure. Nor is it acceptable to say that we will achieve reductions of EUR 75 billion +/– 25 or whatever, and a few months later we come along with a proposal for a euro-facility. If this is the way forward and is under discussion, then in the interests of the unity of the European budget, it should be included in the European budget. Anything else would outsource the core of the European Union and ultimately weaken it. That is not something that any of us can seriously want. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore add my own voice to Mr Swoboda’s. We want an agreement and we expect the European Council, in the event of an agreement being reached, to grant the Cyprus Presidency a mandate that is an adequate basis for flexible and open-ended negotiations with the European Parliament with a view to achieving a result in the coming weeks. If no suitable proposals are forthcoming, a poor, indeed an extremely poor offer from the European Council will be much worse for the European Parliament than the safety nets granted to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. We will not fall through the safety net! This is not a crisis! We would simply find ourselves working with different and quite possibly better figures.</p>

The approach taken by the President of the Council, namely further cutting the money for certain Member States and least-favoured regions, while increasing the lump sum for Germany and the Netherlands and doing nothing about the United Kingdom rebate, is wholly unacceptable. By cutting funds for less-developed regions, budgets, and financing and pre-financing rates, the structural funds are being indiscriminately penalised, despite having already been adversely affected by the Stability and Growth Pact. They are robbing the poor to buy the approval of the rich in a wretched accounting logic, which has become the focal point of the next Union budget. Without money, the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform cannot happen. We cannot ask our farmers to endure more greening, more liberalisation and more international competition, and then reward them with drastic cuts in the CAP. Without money, the necessary increase in internal convergence between our Member States and our regions will be impossible, bearing in mind that it would be irresponsible to further increase the internal divergences in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most severe and probably the most damaging element of this proposal is the significant reduction in funds for cohesion policy. Such a proposal is completely unacceptable because in future it would be particularly damaging for the European Union as a family of states. The substance of cohesion policy is to align the level of development of all EU regions, thus the Council proposal to reduce these funds, which would be particularly detrimental to the regions that are currently the least developed, completely negates the substance of cohesion policy and would lead to a so-called two-speed Europe. The second highly criticised proposal by the Council is to reduce spending on agriculture. It is particularly hard to welcome the Council’s proposed extension of the transition period during which direct payments have to be harmonised for all EU Member States. Finally, the money that the Council currently plans to grant for the decommissioning of three nuclear power plants and specifically Lithuania’s nuclear power plant. First of all, the estimated funds are totally inadequate for the decommissioning of this facility. Secondly, the suspension of support in 2017 is completely unacceptable. Support must be provided over the period of at least the whole of the new financial perspective. Otherwise an undue burden would be imposed on Lithuania, which it really would be incapable of financing from its national budget, and other vitally important areas administered by the state would suffer as a result.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a discussion about what we want Europe to be: whether we are going down the road of greater integration and solidarity between rich and poor or whether we view our relationships solely in terms of money. Give just what you have to. If I contribute to the budget, what is in it for me? In this context, I can understand the division of states into friends of cohesion and friends of better spending. We can see in the Czech Republic where the policy of cuts is leading and I do not want Europe to go the same way. The European budget amounts to just 1 % of all the Member States’ budgets and 94 % of it goes back into projects in the Member States. We have the opportunity at a European level to support activities leading to growth and to reducing unemployment or activities which exceed the capabilities of individual states, such as transport links.

We cannot aim for greater economic, social and territorial cohesion, deeper market integration and economic growth, and, at the same time, cut the budgetary lines meant to sustain these.

It is important to increase funding for employment, education, training, mobility, youth and social inclusion. Social inclusion of young Europeans has to be mainstreamed and prioritised in all relevant policies financed from the EU budget. Youth-related instruments, such as the Youth Guarantee, have to be proposed by the European Commission. The necessary funding for Cohesion policy (structural funds and cohesion fund) should remain available for all regions and maintained at least at 2007-13 level. 25 % of the overall funding for cohesion policy should be allocated to ESF (European Social Fund) to promote employability and social investment. 20 % of ESF funding should be set aside for promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. European Globalisation Fund shall be continued and upgraded as in instrument to help all categories of workers to re-enter the labour market and acquire new skills. Also, an adequate support for achieving the EU 2020 targets and Union objectives for climate, energy, resource-efficiency and biodiversity should be provided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Council there is wide division on this subject. Parliament believes that the next financial perspective should be guided by the Europe 2020 strategy to help relaunch the economy, create jobs and growth, and promote cohesion and solidarity. The EU budget is a budget for investment, given that only 6 % is destined for administrative expenses. It has recognised added value and an important leverage effect in terms of public investment and the creation of wealth and jobs. Accordingly, at a time of recession, it makes no sense to reduce it. It would be an even greater mistake to reduce the MFF amount at the cost of cohesion policy, which would clearly show a lack of solidarity with the poorest regions and Member States. Many seem to forget that cohesion policy consists of the European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund, and therefore contributes towards smart growth, research, capacity building and, at its heart, sound expenditure. For example, in Portugal around two-thirds of cohesion policy funds are used for smart growth. These difficult times demand courage, solidarity and a strategic vision on the part of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Council is not a direct party to the negotiations, but the Council is guided by political agreement on key questions of politics! When we speak of the MMF, we are talking about the projection of our political priorities for a given period into financial terms. These negotiations are about more than just money. The MMF sets the budgetary discipline and ensures that expenditure is incurred systematically and in accordance with our political objectives. We know that the EU budget is a key instrument in overcoming the current crisis and an expression of solidarity within the EU. Correct determination of the financial priorities will have a positive impact on growth and employment. A marked increase will be needed in the financing of projects aimed at increasing competitiveness, supporting small and medium size enterprises, supporting research and innovation, investment aimed at job creation and support for measures to combat climate change. But let us not forget that the negotiations on the MMF should be completed as quickly as possible, definitely by the end of 2012. Only this will allow us to make a smooth transition from one financial period to the next. If we want to be able to start to implement these programmes from January 2014, political agreement must be reached at least eighteen months before the Framework enters into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cohesion policy is one of the genuine success stories in the history of the EU, but you will destroy it if you continue down this path. However, I also agree with Mr Farage that the previous Hungarian Socialist government’s use of Community funds to support canine fitness programmes is unacceptable.

While the European Commission proposed a EUR 1.025 billion budget for the next seven-year period, the latest proposal from the Council, issued by Herman Van Rompuy, suggested cutting the Commission proposal by EUR 80 billion. The European Parliament has made its position clear on many occasions. We want a long-term budget that will allow growth, investment, flexibility and transparency, in order to allow the EU to tackle future challenges and unforeseen needs. A reduced budget will only put EU policies in jeopardy and damage the EU in the long run. On the eve of the Council meeting I wish to remind the Council that the Parliament’s approval is needed for any agreement on the MFF, and we will be ready to use our veto if our position is not taken into consideration. Lastly, I should like to underline to the Council that failing to compromise and reach an agreement on the MFF sends bad signals to foreign investors, to economic markets, and certainly to EU citizens whose socio-economic interests are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How do we expect the EU to keep its commitments to development and the promotion of human rights with such large cuts in the European development fund? We are at a turning point of the European construction. We are faced with two choices.

For its economic and political power to continue to grow, it needs to be underpinned by a budget which promotes solidarity among the different Member States and generations and creates synergies between different policy areas, while at the same time enhancing competitiveness. I deplore all political attempts to use the budget to weaken or bring an end to the European Union. In order to sustain a united Europe, the next seven-year budget must therefore contain the points listed below. Every budget heading must ensure that the goals and commitments set out within it are fully covered, without taking resources away from other budget headings. Any budget cuts must be spread evenly across the various headings. Cohesion must be geared towards ensuring that freedom of movement is not a necessity driven by despair, but something freely chosen. The budget must enable the cohesion countries to catch up effectively, without trying to delude them. It must not call into question the European social model. It must clearly highlight the priorities. In the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the key issues here are a uniform and flexible budget, the European Stability Mechanism, and political agreement on the own resources issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The greatness of the current Member State leaders will therefore be measured by their ability or otherwise to reach an acceptable compromise.

All those threatening to use their veto should consider whether the lack of agreement does not, in fact, harm the interests and expectations of their own voters.

Member States whose leaders are insisting on freezing or reducing the amount of MFF tend to ignore the fact that during the recent past national budgets have grown several times faster than the EU budget. Freezing the EU budget will demonstrate both hypocrisy and irresponsibility for 2020 priorities which cannot be realized without increasing the MFF, not reducing it. The EU is based first of all on the principle of mutual solidarity. Estonia still has lower pensions than Greeks. Even so, it is contributing to the rescue operation to help Greece out of the crisis. However, solidarity can work only both ways. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania still have their infrastructures designed for relations with the Soviet Union, not with Europe.

Of course, it will not be free of charge. This must entail the use of the appropriate instruments which are, or will be, available. These undoubtedly include the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020, which should be used to fulfil the Strategy 2020. Unfortunately, negotiations on the MFF have recently got stuck and there has been a certain split among Member States. The group dominated by ‘net contributors’ is demanding cuts in the MFF. If such cuts are implemented, the MFF will shift to a level of about EUR 973 billion, which would mean a fall of EUR 20 billion in comparison with the current MFF at 2011 prices. I am therefore a fan of the second group (‘the friends of cohesion’), which supports the Commission’s original proposal, because I consider the MFF to be the key instrument in overcoming the crisis. If the cuts are implemented, there would be a reduction in competitiveness, growth and employment in the EU. In order to overcome the budget uncertainties, it is essential that the negotiations between institutions are completed as quickly as possible. Any further obstructions will unnecessarily increase the tension during negotiations, rather than effectively resolving the future of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the deepening cuts in the area of cohesion policy are a source of worry. I do not understand why the Council consistently discriminates against this expenditure, in spite of its unquestioned success in boosting investment and growth in the regions that most need it. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposed cuts to the common agricultural policy raise questions about the sense of imposing new burdens on farmers. If we expect them to apply advanced greening practices, we must also ensure that the payments related to these practices are sufficiently high. Otherwise, we will create a situation whereby farmers may lose all incentive to meet environmental criteria in return for diminishing direct payments. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the proposed cuts to the second pillar of the CAP are unacceptable. Rural areas throughout Europe are in urgent need of development, and not just in terms of agricultural production or environmental protection. Second-pillar CAP financing is relied upon by all inhabitants of rural areas, who require modernised infrastructure, specialist health care and investment in education, recreation, tourism and sport. This is essential if we are to halt the damaging trend of migration from villages to towns. In the light of the above considerations, Parliament should firmly oppose any cuts in these budget areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is strange that Parliament is regarded more and more as some sort of necessary evil. It is only listened to reluctantly and under duress.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a sustainable operating model from the perspective of European democracy. The multiannual financial framework is not a show of strength between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a strong budget that can be used to respond to the social pressures, increased unemployment and reduced competitiveness caused by the crisis. This means that more money is needed, and it should be aimed at measures that increase growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Even this week, there is a group of demonstrators standing in front of Parliament, demanding work and social justice. Why has the social dimension of the crisis been forgotten? The European Union is in the prime position for financing projects and programmes to increase growth and investment all over Europe. Without growth and investment, no new jobs will be created. The current line of savings will only increase social inequality and displacement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the worst-off and socially most vulnerable sectors of society that are hit the hardest by unrealistic objectives. Thanks to the crisis, 25 million citizens have remained out of work in the EU, 5.5 million of them young people. It seems unbelievable that the equation of this social crisis could be solved merely by making the austerity programmes even more stringent. Discord and blame do not help to create a budget agreement, nor do they help to polish the tarnished image of the EU among citizens. A resolute, logical and credible economic policy is needed now. A balanced budget policy is needed, as well as sufficient active stimulation. Europe and Europeans need jobs, investment and growth now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a consumption budget. Investment in the attainment of the European Union’s common goals and the fulfilment of its obligations provides considerable added value to Europe’s nations as a whole. However, the budget must be sufficient to attain these goals. Particular emphasis should be placed on investment in cohesion policy, agriculture, research and education, which are vital cornerstones for the EU’s growth. At the moment it is clear that the European Council’s approach is precluding growth. If we cannot ensure or even plan to ensure that the ambitious goals of the Europe 2020 strategy will be achieved through the EU multiannual budget, both the European Council and the Presidency ought to be honest and say as much. Let us avoid the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy, where people by and large persisted in speaking about it, while already knowing that its goals would not be achieved. One of the EU’s values is solidarity. I hope that the promises that have been made to the Baltic States will materialise in concrete actions. Actions speak louder than words. To conclude: the only way in which we will be able to emerge from the crisis in time is to invest in a targeted way and with sufficient resources in our joint growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we understand the financial restraints and the rationalisation efforts which the Member States are making, the cuts proposed in the European Council’s draft conclusions are unacceptable. As regards cohesion policy, the proposals made by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, for cuts amounting to EUR 29.5 billion in relation to the Commission’s proposal, represent the fourth round of cuts since that proposal was presented. The same 27 countries which in June unanimously decided on the need for investment, are now competing to see who will propose the biggest cuts in what is purely an investment budget, the European budget. We therefore continue to maintain that we need an ambitious European budget, capable of financing the priorities of the European Union, and that this cannot possibly be achieved with cuts.

The proposal involves a budget cut of EUR 81 billion (EUR 74.5 billion in the multiannual financial framework and EUR 6.2 billion in other budget lines). I am wholly against the proposal presented by the President of the Council as it advocates a reduction of approximately EUR 30 billion in cohesion policy funds and another EUR 25 billion in agriculture and rural development funds. These are two European policies which significantly benefit Portugal and the Portuguese people, and I cannot therefore agree to a drastic reduction in their financial envelope. As I have already done in the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development and in various other forums on this issue, I continue to firmly reject the 48 % reduction in the specific additional allocation for the outermost and sparsely populated regions. Only with an increased budget can the European Union invest in growth and jobs, thus helping to overcome the severe economic and crisis that we are experiencing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is struggling to tackle the crisis and the Member States are more divided than ever, certainly when it comes to the new multiannual budget. An ambitious agreement is nonetheless supremely important for the future of the Union, because the budget is the only solidarity mechanism that we have in the Union and that solidarity mechanism is under pressure. Net payers are no longer willing to foot the bill for countries that are struggling, which puts the future of the whole European construction at risk. The financial crisis is undermining the whole solidarity mechanism. It is ironic that it is those countries above all who think that we should cut spending ‘together’, who want to prevent Member States from acting out of real solidarity with each other. Cutting spending together is alright, building something up together is not. That is why it is essential that the Union has its own funds at its disposal. Otherwise solidarity within the EU will simply come under more and more pressure. That is the only way we will be able to draft a European budget with sufficient funds to invest in sustainable growth and jobs.

We must not get confused over the debate: it is not a matter of deciding which programmes are to be cut, but what future we want for our Union. Too often, we hear that the European budget was an expenditure budget, when in reality it is an investment budget, a strategic instrument to support intelligent, inclusive and sustainable growth. I must emphasise one point: the Connecting Europe Facility and its transport dimension. We know that the transport sector is a lever for growth and competitiveness and a key source of employment. Yes, Parliament has asked for a large budget for it, but I would actually describe it as ambitious. Our House will be extremely vigilant, even if our hopes are in vain, in the negotiations over the next couple of days in the European Council, which must not forget that the European Parliament will have its say. It will thus be able to say yes, or say no if the proposal on the table is not satisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to the impression given by this debate, and despite the impassioned statements made on both sides, the Council and Commission positions do not substantially differ. There is less than 0.2 % of EU gross national income between them. The clear message is therefore that, in a Europe of inequalities and divergence, the funds for economic and social cohesion are going to be cut! This message is in line with the established practice of this European Union: robbing the poor to give to the rich. On the one hand, they want to extend and deepen integration and the single market, by ensuring new and better conditions for the colonisation of markets by the net beneficiaries of the single market. On the other hand, these same net beneficiaries want to squeeze the budget, particularly the cohesion lines – which are the best way of minimising the divergence between our economies – while, however, safeguarding in relative terms those lines from which they hope to secure more resources. This is a path that cannot be accepted by all those – such as Portugal – who will suffer as a result, and severely so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
