<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Pierre Jouyet, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. − (FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council fully acknowledges the vital importance of taking appropriate measures with a view to improving the situation of the Roma and of promoting their fundamental rights, as this House requested in its resolution of 31 January.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, real progress has been made under the French Presidency in the areas of non-discrimination and inclusion and, in this context, it has been possible to take account of the situation of the Roma, not least within the package on the Social Agenda, as it was presented by Commissioner Špidla on 2 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the package presented by the Commission is to give fresh impetus to policies to combat poverty, exclusion and discrimination affecting the most vulnerable groups, and, from this point of view, the proposals that were made by the Commission and that take stock of the existing instruments, which help ensure the greater inclusion of the Roma population, truly are a very good contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Council regrets that the Member States were unable to agree as one on a package relating to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, in financial terms. I also wished to say this on the occasion of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European summit on the Roma was held on 16 September. It was supported by the President of the Commission and by the French Presidency of the European Union. The declaration that was adopted underlines the Member States’ responsibilities with a view to ensuring the meaningful inclusion of the Roma, by laying emphasis on the strengthening of people’s individual rights and on the importance of the participation of Roma organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">A second equality summit was held on 29 and 30 September 2008. During this summit we emphasised the problems with which the Roma population is all too often faced, be it in terms of access to education, jobs or vocational training, as well as access to other goods and services, and this enabled us to see how to act more effectively to combat the discrimination suffered by this population.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased with the inclusion of the situation of the Roma within the European Union and will ensure that this is one of the priorities of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency recently produced some draft conclusions relating to the specific situation of the Roma. These conclusions will be submitted to the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers and the General Affairs and External Relations Council next Monday and Tuesday. I shall give your Committee on Foreign Affairs an account of them on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft conclusions call on the Commission and the Member States to take account of the situation of the Roma in the design and implementation of policies on the protection of fundamental rights, in the policy on combating poverty and discrimination, in policies on gender equality and in those on access to education, housing, health care, jobs, the law and culture. In these draft conclusions we call for the Commission and the Member States to identify tangible actions for 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in view, provision is also made for better use of the Structural Funds. It is for this reason that the Council invites the Commission to present it, in 2010, with a report on the progress made, to continue discussions and to organise the necessary exchanges with the Roma organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wished to say to this House, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">– (CS)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first European summit on the Roma, which took place in Brussels on 16 September, was of fundamental importance for the partnership between the main actors in this area. It involved the participation of more than 500 senior representatives of EU bodies, Member States and non-governmental organisations and it was a reflection of our renewed determination to increase efforts to confront the social exclusion of Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a clear message that the overall aim must be to integrate the Roma fully into the economic, social and cultural life of Europe and to ensure equal opportunities for everyone in the EU, including Roma. Civil society must be fully engaged in this partnership. It follows from this that the Roma must participate in proposing, implementing and monitoring policies which apply to them. The Commission therefore welcomes the contribution made to the summit by non-governmental organisations, for example the declaration from the EU Roma Policy Coalition. Unprecedented progress has been achieved this year on Roma integration through the combined efforts of the EU and the Member States and through cooperation founded on mutual trust and good will.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Commission the most important conclusions of the summit were: the undertaking to promote the individual rights of Roma men, women and children; an acknowledgement of the fact that the EU and the Member States have a shared responsibility to support Roma integration in their different spheres of activity; an acknowledgement that the EU must support the Member States in carrying out their policies via coordination and financial support from the structural funds; a consensus that it is necessary to support culturally sensitive approaches focused on Roma which will promote their integration into the mainstream in terms of education, employment and communities without excluding other similarly disadvantaged members of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also gave a clear message at the summit that it will take all essential steps within its sphere of activity towards improving the situation of Roma and that it would ensure that they are able to make full use of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. The Commission will not hesitate to intervene where there is a breach of Community law, and that includes fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the conclusions of the summit, President Barroso and I have proposed the creation of a platform for Roma inclusion. This would provide a framework for bilateral meetings at a high level so that, for example, financial instruments supporting the policies of cohesion and rural development may be better targeted at Roma integration. In addition to this, the platform would constitute a concrete fulfilment of the Commission’s promise to make the instruments and policies of the Community more effective and to report on results achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the conclusions from the June meeting of the European Council, the Member States should now evaluate progress to date and increase their efforts towards full Roma integration. The Commission will of course support the Member States. Apart from this, the Commission is looking forward to the meeting of the Council for General Affairs on 8 December, at which proposals will be debated in respect of the conclusions on Roma integration.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that this process has now nevertheless ground to a halt. According to the European Parliament and non-governmental organisations, professional monitoring and European Community oversight are needed, for although the Member States have indicated in the plans submitted to the European Union their intention to integrate the Roma living within their borders, their nationally adopted budgets and the results to date do not support these declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">The individual projects financed from EU sources have not yielded striking results. The exclusion of European Roma from the economy and from housing, their lack of access to quality education, the troubling health care indicators have not improved but rather deteriorated, and continue to weaken Europe’s social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional efforts are needed that are much more comprehensive than the project-based approaches to date, and they must address both Roma and non-Roma society in order to develop the areas mentioned in a way that transcends parties and cycles. A fundamental condition for the success of these efforts is that future presidencies also commit themselves to the joint European actions prepared under the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for immediate measures to be taken aimed at gaining acceptance for the Roma and harnessing their economic capacity in the service of European development. From the start of the cohesion policy until the enlargement of 2004, there were some successes, but to have to wait three more decades is far too long. This situation requires nothing less than crisis measures. The Roma ghettoes can only be eliminated by the reintegration of their several thousand inhabitants into the labour market, and by maximum use of new and undeveloped areas of the economy – such as renewable and alternative energy or environmental protection – and the creation of quality integrated education.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roma’s own identity, their national identity deriving from their home country and their social and economic identity must be strengthened simultaneously. The inclusion of a EUR 5 million pilot project in the 2009 budget guarantees that we can talk about this issue, but the process must not stop there. Instead of bilateral meetings, we need an EU strategy that can create new elements, legal foundations and potential sanctions as well as monetary mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past year, it has become clear that more needs to be done in this area, primarily by the Member States, but also by the European Union. The Council will soon be addressing this subject again. This alone is a sign that our Heads of Government set great political store by effective policy, with good reason, to counter discrimination of the Roma and their social and economic exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is also high on the Commission’s agenda. In September, it organised the first Roma Summit, in which representatives of the Member States, the Commission itself and in particular representatives of the Roma civil society were given the opportunity to make recommendations regarding European Roma policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the European Roma strategy, a high-level political meeting should be an annual fixture with a view to checking progress on policy, exchanging positive experiences, but also – should this prove necessary – sounding critical notes. I hope that the Commissioner can commit to this today.</p>
<p class="contents">More needs to be done, though. This is why the European Council has to set the Commission a clear and specific task to develop a broad, strategic and long-term policy framework in a bid to break the vicious circle of exclusion in which generations of European Roma are trapped.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to wait any longer with policy proposals. It is obvious what needs to be done: countless studies and policy recommendations have mapped out the bottlenecks. The resolutions of the European Parliament give a clear and specific summary of possible policy initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Education, housing, employment and health were identified as four priority areas in which material and human resources were to be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission statement we have just heard is not a very convincing statement, and I must say honestly it reminded me eerily of the propaganda statements of Eastern European socialist dictatorships. As in those days, so today we hear of nothing but success, development and other positive messages, while in reality the Roma are still living in camps and ghettoes, are daily confronted by humiliation, discrimination and in the worst case by racist attacks, as a result of which nearly 30 thousand Roma from Italy alone are wandering across the territory of the European Union seeking a home at last in one of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am holding in my hand a letter from Vice-President Barrot dated 6 November, in which he assures me and four of my fellow Members that – and I quote – ‘regarding the EU Roma strategy we can be sure that he will work closely with Commissioner Špidla to see that it meets the expectations of Roma non-governmental organisations’. However, there is no mention of a strategy, but only of a Roma integration platform. How can this be explained?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the European Roma summit, I have heard only criticism from the non-governmental organisations of the fact that they expected far more from this historic summit, and that they were not included in the preparations. But I will go even further: it is still not clear how the Berlusconi government has reported to the European Commission on the results of the fingerprinting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must call a spade a spade. We have a problem with the Roma, and this is that they are strongly rejected in most societies to varying degrees. Italy was mentioned, the Czech Republic and Romania are familiar with examples of real pogroms, racist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation the European Union should do one thing, namely, give the Roma the status of a European minority. In other words, official recognition is the first step towards combating exclusion. Secondly, we should then develop a strategy with the Roma which must, however, comprise two parts. A strategy for the Roma who are settled, and a strategy for the Roma who travel around. For the travellers cannot be made to settle by force or those who are settled made to travel. It is a difficult problem. I was responsible for Roma in Frankfurt for six years and I know how difficult the day-to-day work is.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fundamental problem is – and that is why what has been said about the organisation is also correct: if we do not establish structures with the representatives of Roma organisations, we will fail because we will always talk paternalistically about their problems and not try to solve their problems together with them – including their objections. We talk about schools, for example. However, there are Roma families who do not want to send their children to school, and others who do want to send them to school. These are different problems. I therefore agree that we should stop giving such positive status reports as ‘We are concerned’ and ‘We have programmes’ and so on, when we know that it does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">In short: firstly acknowledge the problem more clearly and secondly integrate the Roma organisations into the process more radically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand the pragmatic approach free of any political and ideological implications, an approach – as President Barroso said at the summit held in Brussels on 16 September – which needs all leaders to be involved, without exclusion, from the Roma community to the public authorities, headed by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies on Roma certainly come under the remit of Member States, but it is a good thing that they are finally being coordinated at Community level. Good practices should be coordinated and the use of funds be monitored on a regular basis. How many resources have been squandered over the last few years? How many opportunities have been lost? Looking at the real situation and taking account of proper exceptions, the budget is unfortunately in deficit. Too many funds have not been used, too many have been wasted on measures and projects which have produced no results. If we want to be serious about this, we cannot pretend that this has not happened. In this respect, we can really say: ‘whoever is without sin, cast the first stone’. The Commission has produced a useful document for Member States. Everyone must now do their bit, starting off by relentlessly combating every form of racism and discrimination and advocating serious integration policies, which will primarily have three priority areas: education, vaccinations and health care, as well as professional training and work start programmes, also using micro-credit funds.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should ask the Roma people to assume their responsibilities. Just let me give you an example. We must absolutely stop tolerating Roma parents forcing their children to beg, taking them out of educational activities to do so. Exploitation and illegal activities cannot be tolerated at all in any form. It is only by combining solidarity, integration and respect for regulations that we can find the right strategy for resolving these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They can, of course, be further denigrated by claiming that it is their own fault, whereas it is precisely their educational, housing, health and employment situation that resembles that of the developing world. Without immediate, concentrated and targeted external assistance, these 10–12 million people have no chance to break out of their poverty and exclusion. This degree of social exclusion impedes the basic fulfilment of the Roma’s human dignity and equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is already several decades past the time when it could contemplate from a distance the fact that alongside such great economic potential, there could be such large numbers of people on its territory living from generation to generation in social exclusion.

<p class="contents">Of course, Member States also have their responsibility concerning Roma in terms of non-discrimination, social inclusion and affirmative local measures. But these responsibilities should be seen as having a subsidiary character. When the Commission emphasises that the main responsibility lies with the Member States, in fact it refuses to undertake its natural responsibilities and goes back to a model which has been proven to be inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We must establish, we must create, a European public space for Roma, a mechanism for effective participation of Roma in policymaking and policy implementation. Without that we cannot really solve the problem. We cannot have a real strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority of Roma in Europe live in poor social conditions and the problems they struggle with have remained unchanged for years; the chief of these are the problems of social exclusion, lack of employment, school segregation and the multiple disadvantages faced by Roma women.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of economic crisis in Europe, it is easy to seek a scapegoat among the representatives of the most vulnerable social groups, and hence violent actions against the Roma are multiplying, targeting innocent people with attacks that have had fatal consequences on more than one occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a situation, the solution is not to collect fingerprints in an ethnically discriminatory manner, or to form law enforcement bodies or militias whose actions are intended to instil fear in decent people in order to frighten them away. The real answer is a European Roma strategy, built on five areas: education, employment, housing, health and active participation in society on the part of the Roma. Without such a European Roma policy, there can be no national Roma policy either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself live in a Slovak region where Roma make up around 10% of the population. Thanks to this, I am intimately familiar with their specific socially disadvantaged situation. The main responsibility lies on the shoulders of local self-government representatives, who are often left alone to deal with very complex issues, related primarily to employment, as a consequence of the Roma population’s low level of education.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to find balanced solutions, we must involve in the dialogue first and foremost representatives of the Roma minority who are intimately familiar with the problems of this community. Only then can our solutions be effective. The European Social Fund is the most important instrument for people’s integration into the labour market. I call on the Member States to ensure that excessive administrative obstacles do not discourage NGOs and local self-governments from seeking European Social Fund funding for projects which assist in the effective resolution of the Roma issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of the often discussed problem concerning the Roma community, we still have not found the most apt solutions which would lead to their lasting integration into society. In my opinion, this applies for all Member States. The base cause continues to be the ethnocentricity of the problem. It is as if we have ‘ethnicised’ the social problems of the Roma and treated these as problems solely belonging to a separate ethnic group. We need to change approach. Yes, an overwhelming section of Roma are poor and do not have access to shelter and adequate education, however these problems do not apply only to them. The combination of these social problems into one separate, ethnic one leads to open discrimination. Because of this, their integration has become more complicated, more intensive and solving their problems has become more difficult. Therefore it is important that we implement a policy for the protection of individual rights and that we have a base instrument: subsidisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bulgaria we have a large number of problems which we associate with the Roma and this has driven us to introduce steps for the preparation of a framework programme to resolve the social preconditions causing their ethnic discrimination. We offer an exchange of positions on the base elements of the framework programme with other Member States to whom this is a problem of considerable extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why did we all adopt this resolution in the plenary here in January? There was a good reason for it. The resolution stated, among other things, that we are in favour of a Roma unit within the Commission, a European Roma strategy, a general approach involving cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, as well as a Roma to Roma approach, as developed by the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe). Nothing has come of it, except a summit meeting where there was even more talk without cooperation from, or with, the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that the Roma community, with whom I have enjoyed ten years of close cooperation, was extremely disappointed with the result. I am sorry, Commissioner Špidla, that I cannot enthuse about your platform, which is yet another forum for debate, albeit at high level, in the framework of bilateral meetings. We have done plenty of talking. If there is anything we need, it is action.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently read an article that started with the words: we are about to have a bloodbath.

What I have taken from it is that, as many of you have emphasised, the Roma as a group are disadvantaged, and are very vulnerable to poverty, discrimination and racist attacks. That has been said, and unfortunately it is true, as many of you have emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Severin, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Mohácsi all quite rightly said, it is also clear that we must not harbour false optimism, and that the strategy will be extremely difficult to implement. As you stressed, in our daily work, we need to make a distinction between those who have become sedentary and those who remain nomadic. They are not the same thing: their practices and living conditions are not the same. In day-to-day practice, even though we really want to help, it truly is very difficult in reality. We must not fall prey to naïve optimism: we need to take determined, ongoing action, and I would say to you, Mr Severin, that the fact that the work of the Council in this area was initiated by Romania is also a good sign and that the fact that the Council has taken up this issue at the behest of your countrymen is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we need to be aware that we have a long road ahead of us: we need to be clear about that, as you have been. I think that the only possible response is, as has been said, to set up structures and associations. That is what we are trying to do, but it is, indeed, extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, as you have underlined, it is vital that we take a European approach to this, not least because it is very much a cross-border problem, not at all a purely national one. It is also obvious, though – and I am saying this for the Commission and in relation to the comments made – that we have to be quite clear about the fact that the Member States also have specific responsibilities in this matter. We can only take legislative initiatives at European level if they fall under the competences granted to the Union in the Treaties today. We must – and I would say this both to Mrs Angelilli and to Mrs Járóka – also take real action at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, therefore, I think that, this year, we have seen a growing recognition of the phenomenon – even if, as you will admit, it has been too slow. I am not sure if we need to follow up on what has been said, and on what basis we can do so, regarding the problem of minorities. Moreover, the Council must continue its work and, above all, the Member States’ actions and the measures actually taken both at national and local level must be stepped up, because the current situation is inhumane and unacceptable. We also need to recognise, though, that this really is a very complex problem in practice. Many thanks for your comments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is pushing for the Member States to tackle this in a culturally sensitive way, taking account of the special needs of the Roma but at the same time striving to give them access to the mainstream, to education, the labour market and housing. The Commission, however, cannot pretend that it is able to represent the Member States in this area, as this would be not only ineffective but also unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is clearly a need to redouble our efforts but, despite the fact that we are still far from achieving our goal, it is clear that things are beginning to move, since the first European forum on the Roma in itself marks a change. The fact that the Roma question is being taken up by the European Union and that this will now be a regular issue at the highest levels also marks a change. If we can get the Roma platform up and running efficiently we will have established a proper foundation from which we will be able to monitor developments, provide suggestions and provide far better policy coordination than has hitherto been the case.

<p class="contents">An initial step towards this would be to create a policy for promoting education for Roma. This policy has to be handled not only by the state, but also by non-governmental organisations which no longer need to make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination, but to educate ethnic groups. This solution is not only based on making the public authorities face up to their responsibilities, but the Roma communities as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the causes of unemployment which Roma face are due to illiteracy, a lack of education and professional qualifications, not to mention a lack of access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">Educational reform for this ethnic group can be carried out in three ways: reducing the level of illiteracy, ensuring studies are completed, and professional specialisation and reconversion. This reform needs to respect Roma’s specific culture and traditions, while also linking the education system to the values of European culture and civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I invite the Commission to draw up a single plan for integrating Roma at European level, based on cooperation between existing inter-governmental and NGO projects. This also includes projects involving representatives from educational institutions.
