<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome this resolution which highlights the declining political situation in Cambodia. The situation must be rectified before the country holds its general elections in July.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we as democrats welcome these elections, they will be meaningless if political activists continue to be intimidated and harassed. The reports that the voter registration process is unfair and undemocratic are of grave concern and must be followed up by real action.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution we urge the Cambodian authorities to allow for free and fair elections, allow freedom of expression, freedom of the media and religious freedom and more. But in reality we have to work harder to exert pressure on the authorities to make these changes. The European Union has to work in liaison with UN and other international organisations on the ground to monitor events and to try to find solutions before the country loses all hope of holding free and democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently freedom of expression is being trampled by the Cambodian authorities. The outbreak of violence which occurred in Phnom Penh is a reaction to a Thai actress's comments that Angkor Wat should be returned to Thailand. This must be condemned. So far the authorities' solution to the violence in Phnom Penh has been to arrest the journalists that broke the news story and to close borders with its Thai neighbours. Furthermore, Cambodia's only independent radio station was closed with the charge of inciting riots. The Cambodian Government reacted to the anti-Thai feeling amongst its population by expelling hundreds of Thais from the country. Such abuses of freedom and clear displays of xenophobia must be stopped now.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this resolution and I call on the European Union as a whole to maintain its vigilance on the situation in Cambodia, and to do everything within its means to secure democratic elections in the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cambodia, despite the promising future that could have been predicted at one time, is becoming dangerously subject to the influence of an authoritarian junta, similar to those in the neighbouring countries of Laos and Burma. Whereas democracy defuses wars, the juxtaposition of despotic regimes here represents a dangerous threat to this entire Asian sub-region. How else can we interpret the crisis that has developed between Cambodia and Thailand, which has led to the devastation of the Thai embassy and Thai possessions in Cambodia and the closure of ground borders between the two countries? This border conflict reflects what takes place on a daily basis in Cambodian society, which is a mosaic of different ethnic groups and cultural and religious diversity and has been harshly and deliberately weakened by the putschist leader, Hun Sen. State violence and all kinds of persecution have recently led to the assassination of Mr Om Radsady, presidential adviser to the national assembly, in the street.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must use the many channels available in order to stabilise this country, and the entire region as well, especially at election time. Let us not forget that Cambodia is the main recipient of aid in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On-going tensions with Thailand and an atmosphere of political intimidation are characterising the run-up to the general elections of 27 July. The draft resolution before us is therefore opportune.</p>
<p class="contents">The religious situation in Cambodia is also giving cause for concern, which is remarkable, as up to now the country has distinguished itself in a positive sense from its neighbours Laos and Vietnam as far as religious freedom is concerned. Still the Christian churches are worried as conflicts between Buddhists and Christians are on the increase. New guidelines from the Ministry of Religious Affairs also threaten to make serious inroads on the freedom enjoyed by Christians to practice their religion in public, provide Christian schooling or build new churches. The resolution rightly asks the Cambodian Government to withdraw these guidelines. I sincerely hope that the Council and the Commission will actively support this appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution contains another appeal to the Cambodian authorities that also meets with my complete approval. They must take all necessary measures to curb the abuse of children. Sadly trafficking in women and children is <span class="italic">in any case</span> an increasing problem in Cambodia. Insiders stress that the national government could do more about this. The US shares this view. Their ambassador gave the Cambodian Government this warning very recently: less aid if they fail to address this. Especially at this time of transatlantic drifting apart, Brussels must form a united front with Washington on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, we have campaigned for the freedom of the Cambodian people, even after the Khmer Rouge had been replaced by the Vietnamese occupation, and, even when the situation appeared as hopeless as it did in the struggle against the regime imposed by the Khmer Rouge, we kept on supporting the human rights of the Cambodians.</p>
<p class="contents">We did this in close collaboration with Son San, a grand old man of Cambodian democracy, who was a frequent visitor to this House. What is even more disturbing is that the current deterioration in the situation follows signs of hope in the shape of last year's local elections, which provided a firm basis, at least in the most general terms, for the beginnings of democracy, which can be established only from the ground upwards, that is, out of local communities, in many of which – fortunately enough – it is actually growing.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes matters even worse is that repression from the centre outwards, that is, on the part of the government, is currently on the increase. This is linked to the regime's fear of democratic movements and of opposition; it has to do with the instability resulting from the unresolved issue of succession to the throne, and with many conflicts along ethnic and religious lines, on which point I have to say, in response to Mr Belder, that these conflicts are not just between Christians and Buddhists, but believers, Buddhist and Christian alike, are being persecuted, and we have to stand up for both of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I want to make it clear that, whilst our cooperation agreement with Cambodia was a step in the right direction, it was a pledge of our confidence, and such a pledge is justified only if the developments initiated by the United Nations, along with the rule of law and the beginnings of democracy, continue without interference. If, however, the elections on 27 July are taken as an occasion for putting leaders of the opposition in fear of their lives and limbs, and intimidating religious groups and ethnic minorities, then that is a lamentable development presaging a fearful backlash, and something that we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">So ‘yes’ to cooperation and to support for the fledgling democracy, but we also have to make it clear to our Cambodian partners that, if they jeopardise their democracy, they are also putting the European Union's cooperation at risk.</p>

I would like to remind you that of all the countries that the European Union gives financial support to, Cambodia receives the most support per head of population.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am very concerned about the human rights situation in Cambodia. We all know that practices such as torture of prisoners, the involvement of the army and police in trafficking of women and children and excessive pre-trial detention are commonplace. I have in mind particularly recent reports about the murder of Om Radsady, the ex-chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Cambodian Parliament, the threats against Princess Vacheahra, the present chair of this Committee, and the continuing violation of the rights of the opposition parties, especially the party of Sam Rainsy and the accusations against him over the responsibility for the attack on the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the light of these events I would urge that the aid to Cambodia from the European Union must not be allowed to be unconditional and that our representatives in Phnom Penh must put explicit pressure on the Cambodian Government to make every effort to improve the human rights situation in their country. With a view to the coming elections, the European Union must also press for guarantees of free, fair and democratic elections and of the safety of the various opposition leaders, otherwise, then the European Union must indeed immediately revoke its cooperation agreement with Cambodia. It would be completely incredible if the European Union, that is always so tough on improving human rights and promoting democracy everywhere in the world, were to give such enormous amounts in financial aid to a country that cannot guarantee either one of these things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the fact that the worst has been avoided over the past few weeks is due to the actions of the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Patten’s actions. Two weeks ago, I went to Phnom Penh. There, I received a dressing-down from Union ambassadors and the Commission representative who considered that the concerns I expressed, together with Mr Maaten and others, when Mr Sam Rainsy was forced to take refuge in the American consulate, to be exaggerated. A few days later, the sister of King Norodom Sihanouk was very seriously threatened by the prime minister and, two days later, Mr Om Radsady, whom I had met with Prince Ranariddh, was assassinated.</p>
<p class="contents">I think or, at least, I hope, that these events will subsequently have given the EU representatives in Phnom Penh pause for thought. It is strange that, here in Brussels or Strasbourg, we should have a more accurate perception of the problems and dangers that threaten a democratic process than people living in Phnom Penh. I believe we should also question all the cooperation projects we manage and the financial sum they represent. I think that this affects the kind of relations that representatives from our countries or our bodies can enjoy in Cambodia, with the vast number of cocktail parties and meetings with local VIPs.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation remains extremely worrying. I believe that our resolution is sound, and I would thank the authors for that. I feel that the threat to cancel the cooperation agreement, because that is precisely what we are talking about, is extremely important. It is a signal that can be heard by the authorities in Phnom Penh to encourage them to continue with the electoral process until July. I do not, however, believe that that will be enough, and with regard to the electoral observation mission, I believe that the ball is currently in Parliament’s court. The Commission has made proposals to appoint the head of this electoral observation mission. I do not think Parliament should allow a single day to pass before responding to the Commission’s invitation and appointing the head of the observation mission as soon as possible, so that they can go to Cambodia without delay, go there frequently and monitor the entire process from now until July. This person must not be merely a witness to the vote count at election time.</p>
<p class="contents">The most crucial game is now being played over access to the media, 95% of which are controlled by the authorities in Phnom Penh. This electoral mission will therefore have to wrestle with the authorities in Phnom Penh. I call upon the competent persons in Parliament to ensure that a strong-willed person is appointed and sent to Phnom Penh as soon as possible</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is entirely of one mind with Parliament in its view that the recent violent deaths of many Cambodian politicians, which a number of Members have mentioned, give cause for grave concern. The Commission very much hopes that the political climate will not deteriorate still further at a time when preparations are being made for Cambodia's forthcoming parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also gives voice to the hope that the investigation mounted by the royal government into the background to the riots on 29 January this year will help make the country more stable. I am able to assure you that the Commission, in close consultation with the EU's Member States, is following further developments in Cambodia with close attention. The Commission is, moreover, concerned about the situation of the media in Cambodia. Free expression of opinion in the press is, admittedly, permitted, but the publicly owned media continue to be under government control to an immense degree.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a point that has already been made by the EU committee that was sent to observe last year's local elections, and it has also been made by the Commission in its representations to the Cambodian authorities. A preparatory mission, led by the Commission and consisting of experts on elections and representatives of the Member States, was in Cambodia from 27 January to 4 February. It is on the basis of the information they brought back with them that a decision will be taken on whether, and if so how, to support the electoral process, and, above all, on whether sending an EU mission to observe the elections on 27 July makes sense, is advisable or, indeed, feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">All those in Cambodia with whom we have entered into dialogue have spoken in favour of the EU being involved in the electoral process and have expressed the view that the observers' mission at the time of last year's local elections had done a great deal to further a climate of confidence and transparency during the election process. The outcome of the preparatory mission, which drew attention both to positive and objectionable aspects of the preparations for the elections, led the EU Member States to endorse the Commission's recommendation that a mission be sent to observe the forthcoming elections. The Commission notes with satisfaction that Parliament has supported this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn now to the problem with the civil disabilities imposed on Christian associations. A decree of 14 January for the prevention of conflicts between individual religious groupings permitted – and I quote – ‘all activities connected with religious propaganda and proselytism, including the dissemination of notices and information brochures, only within religious institutions’.</p>
<p class="contents">Permission for such activities in public can, however, be obtained from the Ministry for Education and Religious Affairs. These provisions apply not only to Christians, but also to all religious bodies, and were introduced to reduce the risk of conflicts and clashes motivated by religion. In the absence of any in-depth legal analysis, it would appear that this decree, like other measures enacted to date by the Ministry for Education and Religious Affairs, does not necessarily constitute a violation either of the Declaration on Human Rights or of the Cambodian Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
