<p class="contents">It is safe to say that we are not in the enviable position of having the perfect <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Where we need freedom, we find recommendations, green papers and communications, yet where we need action – such as the completion of the single market – efforts are sidelined by delayed implementation and long-awaited follow-up reports. Too often, the added value achieved by taking action at the European level is lessened by heavy-handed obligations or ill-conceived provisions. These may originate at the incubation stage in the Commission and find themselves added during Parliament or Council readings or through gold plating in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is today still occasionally remarked to me that any legislation at the European level is automatically bad: either it imposes excessive or unnecessary burdens, or it removes power from national governments or local authorities, or it fulfils any number of other stereotypes used to describe European legislation. I do not believe that this is true. Laws crafted and adopted at the European level help companies across Europe and from beyond to establish themselves in the largest market in the world with some 500 million potential customers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased therefore to present my report today, which I view as the latest in a number of steps which Parliament has taken to drive forward the better law-making agenda. Within the report, I have made several key messages become clear. The Commission as initiator of legislation, the Council as colegislator and the Member States as implementers should all take on board initiatives which we ourselves as a Parliament have put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, concerning subsidiarity, I am very pleased to note that national parliaments have, for the very first time, been able to raise a yellow card procedure, which has hastened the withdrawal by the Commission of the Monti II proposal. It is encouraging that national parliaments have been able to finally take ownership of this avenue for expressing their views, but sadly it remains a difficult path to take successfully. All too often, Brussels is described as a distant and inaccessible bureaucracy, imposing rules from afar. It becomes an easy punchbag in domestic politics, where unwelcome decisions are disowned and cast as Brussels calamities, whilst positive achievements are reclaimed and touted as national triumphs.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur now for two reports on better law making, I am keenly aware also of internal problems faced throughout the institutions, for instance, concerning impact assessments. Partiality risks fatally undermining this process. I am constantly frustrated by impact assessments accompanying proposals which are clearly prepared to justify a certain policy choice. We must reject entirely policy-based evidence and insist on evidence-based policy making from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Essential in this regard is the Impact Assessment Board within the Commission. This is not sufficiently and robustly independent. We must also do our duty here in Parliament, and my report calls for systematic engagement by committees and MEPs with our new internal Impact Assessment Unit in order to aid the committees’ work of scrutinising proposals. I consider that this, in conjunction with the Commission’s routine presentation in their impact assessment at any initial exchange of views on legislative dossiers, would represent a significant step forward for evidence-based policy making in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, in cases where European regulations would adversely affect our smallest businesses excessively, legislation should be left to a more local level where national nuisances can be appropriately addressed. We should, however, look to go further, and I am pleased that Parliament is able to affirm its commitments towards extending exemptions beyond micro-entities to small and possibly medium-sized entities where this would be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that I have run out of time. I will reserve my remaining comments for the two minutes which I get after the debate has taken place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to comment on Parliament’s draft report on the 18th report on better legislation. First, allow me to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for its work in preparing this report. It is a welcome contribution to the smart regulation agenda, which the report acknowledges as a shared responsibility. It also highlights some very important issues concerning relations with national parliaments. The Commission will respond more formally to the report in due course but, for now, I would like to make a few general remarks on the smart regulation agenda, which remains a key priority for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First, your report correctly indicates that impact assessment is a core element of smart regulation. The European Court of Auditors and other independent studies found that the Commission’s impact assessment system compares favourably to other systems in the European Union. The Commission strives to continuously improve its impact assessment system, for instance, by providing services with further operational guidance on the assessment of specific impacts such as sector competitiveness, fundamental rights or SMEs. The President has reinforced the role of the Impact Assessment Board so that, in principle, a positive opinion from the IAB is needed before a proposal can be put forward for a Commission decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s initiative in setting up an Impact Assessment Directorate and, in particular, the renewed commitment of Parliament to carry out impact assessments prior to the adoption of substantive amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing to exchange views, share methodology and background to its assessments with the Parliament, as already agreed in the common approach to impact assessments. We should all bear in mind, of course, that an impact assessment is not an end in itself. It should lead to better policy at the end of the decision-making process and is a joint responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report rightly places considerable emphasis on the need to minimise regulatory burdens for business. The Commission has proposed measures to reduce the administrative burden by 33%. We invite Parliament and the Council to approve pending proposals rapidly to bridge the small remaining gap and so ensure that we reach the 25% reduction target by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that all future legislative proposals should be based on the premise that micro-enterprises, in particular, should be excluded from the scope of the proposed legislation, unless the proportionality of their being covered can be demonstrated. When they need to be covered, we should seek to find adapted solutions and lighter regimes for both micros and SMEs, and their impact should be analysed as an integral part of the impact assessment process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also strengthening the implementation of the Commission’s <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation policy. Now, all significant proposals must, in principle, be based on an evaluation of what is already in place. We are working on further developments to improve the way we do this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also focused on further improving implementation and consultation. The Commission will produce a scoreboard to show that proposals it has produced are having a significant impact on smaller business, to show what changes Parliament and Council adopt in the legislative procedure and how Member States implement the adopted regulatory measure, identifying best practice and any ‘gold plating’. The scoreboard will be updated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">A central element of the Commission’s approach is a strengthening of the involvement and consultation of small businesses in better law making. Conferences are already being held in Member States with small businesses and an EU-wide consultation process has been launched to identify the ‘Top Ten’ burdensome EU regulatory measures for review.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also strengthened the voice of stakeholders by extending the minimum period for public consultation from 8 weeks to 12 weeks, as of the beginning of this year. The Commission has also initiated a review of its consultation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a follow up to the 2010 Smart Regulation Communication, taking stock of the progress made and drawing lessons from experience, is planned for adoption around the end of this year. A 12-week public consultation was launched on 27 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report emphasises the importance of respect for the principle of subsidiarity when drawing up legislative proposals and stresses the importance of the participation of regional parliaments with legislative powers in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity issues are key aspects taken into account by the Commission when carrying out its impact assessments and on which the Impact Assessment Board focuses when scrutinising the quality of impact assessments. The Commission is fully committed to ensuring that in future, subsidiarity justifications are better reflected in the explanatory memorandum of its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning relations with national parliaments, let me reassure you that the Commission pays very close attention to the work of regional parliaments and even receives opinions directly from some of them. After all, we regularly encourage national parliaments to consult regional parliaments with legislative powers, where appropriate, in the process of subsidiarity scrutiny, as set out in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to making progress on smart regulation and looks forward to working with Parliament, the Council and the Member States to ensure effective delivery as a joint responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time, a sufficient number of the Member States’ national parliaments have taken the Commission to task for its interference in the competences of the Member States and thus brought down a European regulation. I am referring to Monti II, the proposed regulation on the exercising of fundamental social rights in the internal market. In my view and, above all, in view of the efforts to get out of the crisis through coming closer together and increased cooperation, this is an important instrument for democracy from both a political but also, in particular, from an economic point of view. Ultimately, we are all familiar with the discussions about the regulation of the financial markets – I only need mention the term supervision of the banks. Especially given this background, I believe that democratic legitimisation and parliamentary control by this House, but also by the national parliaments, are important instruments for democracy that are being actively promoted but which must also be explained to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I would like to raise in this debate is the section of the report dealing with reducing administrative burdens. Obviously we all want – in all groups – to provide a sound working environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, I would like to specifically emphasise that a general exception from European directives for SMEs is not appropriate. When it comes to rules governing health and worker protection, it is an absolute no-go, as these directives, after all, lay down rules governing minimum European standards. There cannot be exceptions here, either for micro-enterprises or SMEs. Quite on the contrary, the Member States can, and should, provide advanced protection for workers in their countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subsidiarity control mechanism which national parliaments have helps make the process more transparent. The majority of the Commission’s proposals have been adopted by national parliaments without any significant discussions taking place about subsidiarity. The only proper debates about the way to interpret subsidiarity have taken place between Parliament and the Council, ending up with a suitable balance being found between the responsibilities of the EU and those of Member States. In practical terms, it can be seen that implementing EU legislation is still a problem nationally, and I think that better communication between national parliaments and the European Parliament could improve this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report touches on a number of issues which are particularly important for Parliament. I should mention among these the need to revise the interinstitutional agreement on better law making, adopting legislation on SMEs and, last but not least, making further improvements for better law making.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I should mention that there were no disagreements in the Committee on Legal Affairs between the main political groups, thereby enabling a compromise to be reached which will help clarify the reversal of the burden of proof for certain groups of businesses, which is something I would thank the main report for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to focus during these couple of minutes on an aspect presented in the report concerning the fact that the Commission needs to be better at explaining and justifying the European added value in the legislative proposals it tables. I would like to emphasise that I am saying this as a committed federalist who would like to see more common decisions and activities at European level. At the same time, we must improve in terms of clarifying and explaining, in simple terms, this European added value in the EU’s work. This applies not only to contact with our citizens; we must also improve our dialogue and cooperation with colleagues throughout the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough that a few officials in the Commission and some Members of this House understand the purpose of the European added value in various proposals. We must get better at listening to citizens’ points of view and at explaining. This can then lead to a greater understanding of the intentions behind European legislation and, in some cases, also make it clear that we do not actually have sufficient grounds for legislating at European level. This is the context into which the whole issue of subsidiarity comes.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will now take these views on board. They are, in fact, particularly relevant on a day like today, the day after Mr Barroso’s speech in yesterday’s sitting. He noted something new, namely, that we need to have an important discussion about European added value and it must be conducted at all levels. In this process, I believe that Mr Karim’s report could be very helpful in clarifying not only the problems, but the solutions, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the European context, better legislation is an extremely important subject, especially because – and this is also the coverage in the media – European laws are viewed as extremely complicated, incomprehensible and difficult to follow and use. However, and I want to stress this very clearly at this juncture, that is, to a very large extent, also down to the implementation in the Member States. Experience of recent years shows, you see, that national problems that governments would otherwise not dare to regulate are often tacked on to European rules. Naturally, the result is that the legislation is overstretched, and it thus becomes incomprehensible. This is a significant and important factor. In this connection, when it comes to the implementation of Union law, we have to raise this element much more strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I find important – and the rapporteur concentrated very heavily on this – was the issue of impact assessments. I agree with him that political decisions should also be based on fact. At the end of the day, there can be no objection to that. That said, impact assessments can also be used to great political effect. I will illustrate with an example. When there was an impact assessment on the introduction of megatrucks, these enormous lorries, onto Europe’s roads, the Commission carried out an impact assessment, which predominantly looked into whether large enterprises would make more profits, rather than how much more public expenditure would be entailed. In other words, an impact assessment always depends on the criteria set for it. If we hide political convictions behind official impact assessments, we are not serving good law making well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider it a success that the report does not focus only on <span class="italic">ex ante</span> evaluations of the bureaucratic burden, but also re-emphasises <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation. In addition to the creation of new regulations based on impressions, completely irrelevant data and unrealistic evidence, one of the biggest sources of excessive regulation is the placing of further requirements above and beyond the directives by Member States themselves – so-called gold plating, as a previous speaker said. Significant reductions can be achieved in gold plating through <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there is much sense in the idea of granting regulatory offsetting, which would require that, in advance of new legislation generating new bureaucratic and administrative costs, ways be found of offsetting these costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by repeating the view which I always express here when we are debating this topic – the view that the Commission finds the European Parliament lacking as a strong partner in the fight against bureaucracy. We should therefore start thinking about setting up a European Parliamentary committee on eliminating the bureaucratic burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, we try to show the areas where there is still much to be done, and I hope that this information from the European Parliament is taken into account both by Parliament itself and by the other legislators, namely the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, however, the discussion has a special character, as we are speaking at a time of economic crisis and also of a crisis of faith in the possibility and even the sense of developing the European institutions, as well as a crisis of faith in the institutions’ effectiveness. Our task is to revive the work of the European Union and to make it more effective, and to rebuild trust in European law – law that is, after all, reflected in national legislation. It is this issue of cooperation with our national partners, with national parliaments and with regional parliaments that is absolutely central. An example of just how important this is was the first ever use of the yellow card procedure against the Commission regarding the Monti II Regulations as well as the behaviour of the European Parliament – quick and effective – which led to the Commission withdrawing this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key issue today concerns further reductions in the administrative burdens and barriers that make small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the driving force behind the European economy, look to us to make better laws so that they can function properly, freely and sensibly and create jobs, which is the most important way to combat the crisis. For this reason, I would like to thank Mr Karim and the other Members of the European Parliament for this year’s report, and I hope that its conclusions will soon be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As pointed out in this report, the modified legislative environment introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon needs to be better reflected in European legislation, as provided for in the smart regulation agenda. Better law making means simplified, smarter and more transparent legislation, taking into account Europe’s multilayered governance. In that regard, I believe the closer involvement of national and regional parliaments in our legislative process needs to be reinforced, especially in the light of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We have at our disposal very useful tools in relation to national contributions to EU law, such as the IPEX platform. However, the follow-up and the <span class="italic">ex post</span> control could, and should, be enhanced: firstly, through an improved statement from the Commission of the ground for its initiative (subsidiarity or proportionality), and secondly, through an extended timeframe for national parliaments to carry out subsidiarity checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to underline the urgent need for an update of the 2003 interinstitutional agreement on better law making, and I look forward to discussing the upcoming Commission progress report on the Smart Regulation agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yes, we should make international laws only where we actually need international laws; and, yes, where we make laws they should be clear and easy to understand. Yes, we need to think much harder about the consequences of our laws. Our impact assessments are not good enough, and then Parliament flings in amendments without thinking about the consequences. Yes, we need to work more closely with our national parliaments and, I would add, our local authorities, who often have to deal with our red tape. Yes, we must be aware of the burden of bureaucracy on our small companies and especially on micro-businesses – tiny businesses which, in many cases, should be excluded from much of our international law.</p>

It states in the first few paragraphs, I quote: ‘[The European Parliament] stresses that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality must be respected by the European institutions when legislating’. Unquote.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, my most fundamental comment on this report. First of all, what we need is not the new European treaty announced by Mr Barroso yesterday. No, in reality, what we need is a thorough review of where and how European policy is really useful and necessary and where it is not useful or necessary at all. We also need to look again at how many European institutions, how many European administrations and how many European rules and regulations are really useful and necessary and how many are not useful or necessary. If we did, we would, in my opinion, not just be making huge savings for the taxpayers, but also paying real respect to the principle of subsidiarity, a lot more respect than just treating the symptoms, which is what we seem to have been doomed to so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in reality, we are very far from that union of nation states which Mr Barroso advocated yesterday. One further comment. There seems to be a touch of euphoria about what we know as the ‘yellow card’ procedure. Let us be honest, we have hardly used it. It is merely a stopgap, an opportunity for national parliaments to have their say which, in reality, offers no opportunity at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced.</p>

<p class="contents">In the creation of European legislation, we must be guided by two fundamental principles of European Union law – the principle of subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality. I firmly believe that we must involve the national parliaments of the individual Member States in the European legislative process in a much more significant way, since they play an important role in monitoring the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">European institutions must also simplify and consolidate efforts in the area of better creation and simplification of EU legal regulations and also reduce the administrative and regulatory burden. Our goal is to ensure that European legislation is as close as possible to citizens and, in particular, that they understand it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also not forget the fact that subsidiarity may lead to an extension of the activities of the EU within the framework of its powers when circumstances so require and, conversely, to the action concerned being restricted or curtailed where it is no longer justified.

It is true that many EU laws are written in specialist language that is difficult to understand, and this makes it more difficult to appreciate the sense of decisions that are taken. This is, of course, partly justified by the nature of the law in question or by other factors which affect the final wording of a particular document.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report we are discussing today is an important step towards bringing the European Union closer to ordinary people. We need laws that are simple, transparent and can be understood by everyone, and we need a reduction in the regulatory burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. We must make the Commission and the Council aware of the fact that increasing the number of laws drafted in impenetrable and specialist language will not help to make the European Union more popular with its citizens. Finally, legislation adopted by European Union institutions should be based on facts, and should be verified and checked frequently to ensure it is effective and useful because, in the final analysis, the legislation is being created for EU citizens and it is they who should benefit from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is often talk of the growing deficit in this area, with some justification. Acting on the basis of treaties that are in force, both the European Parliament and national parliaments have an important role to play in the decision-making process. However, as can be seen from Mr Karim’s report, these rights are not always reflected in practice. It would appear from the rapporteur’s conclusions that the European Commission does not always abide by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality properly. According to national parliaments, this is sometimes evidenced by no justification being given, or only a partial justification, concerning the principle of subsidiarity in its initiatives. For this reason, greater weight should be given to the involvement of our national parliaments in the process of checking legislative proposals in the light of the above two principles.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, like the speakers before me, I would like to emphasise the urgent need for better controls – by our Chamber, too – of delegated and implementing acts that are issued, since important issues often escape democratic control through these procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are forgetting what von Pufendorf taught us, namely, that general laws should be few in number and they should be correctly understood. To that end, those who enact laws ought to be as clear as possible. Montesquieu always stressed that legal language must be precise and concise.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we must avoid using complex doublespeak, full of neologisms and unjustified linguistic borrowings, because it produces an evil web where traps lie in wait and arbitrariness resides. In this Parliament, we deal with complex subjects, but it is our obligation to ensure they are passed on to citizens in an accessible and comprehensible manner. It often happens that even legal professionals – judges and lawyers – despair at our texts.</p>

The former tries, with very limited success, to prevent competences being exercised at EU level if they could be more efficiently exercised at Member State level. Indeed, when can they not? The latter attempts to prevent legislation going beyond, and I quote: ‘what is necessary to achieve the objects of the Treaty’. It is a pity we cannot cut off the last seven words and stop at the word ‘necessary’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a third principle being applied during the legislative process for as long as we have to put up with EU legislation at all. I would call this principle the ‘cost-benefit rule’ which would require that the calculated benefit of all legislation when quantifiable was equal to or greater than the cost it imposed on business and the public. In December 2009, Open Europe published a list of the 100 most costly EU laws and calculated the cumulative cost by 2020 to be GBP 184 billion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that there is a very real need for reform of our processes. The greater involvement of national parliaments and parliamentarians is something that needs to be introduced in a streamlined way so that our legislation takes full account of local factors where it is necessary for them to be included, and indeed provides us with much greater scope to decide whether we actually need to legislate at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-compliance by some Member States, right the way through to gold plating by others, takes away the very reason for our existence. When we move forward with legislation – and we have a very heavy agenda in this Parliament regarding standardisation of processes – genuinely helpful measures become deeply unhelpful because they are applied in different ways. National parliaments today have the opportunity to be involved in our processes right from the outset. Therefore, hopefully, we take away their need sometimes to take those actions at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to micro-entities and SMEs, they are the backbone of the EU’s economy. We can all recall that in 2005, President Barroso stood in this very Chamber and spoke about the unnecessary burdens that had to be taken away from that section of our economy. I came to this Parliament eight years ago from a background in law, business and politics. I knew only too well the burdens placed on SMEs, sometimes unnecessarily. Even now, their biggest complaint of unnecessary burdens remains the same and it is justified.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to move this report today to ensure that people are aware that we are taking their grievances on board. The circumstances dictate that this work is required. With citizens still feeling we are too distant, national parliamentarians remaining ill-informed of our processes, and a breakdown in confidence in our ability to face the huge challenges our Union now has, we must look to see where we can reform and improve. Post-Lisbon, and prior to the steady march into the unknown as announced by President Barroso yesterday, the best we can do is behave in a way our people can support: reform and take our people with us. President Barroso’s vision of moving without the people, by diktat, is not fitting for a modern Union fit for purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not allow the Council to blur the clear distinction between delegated and implementing acts, and we therefore urge the Commission to ensure the proper application of the two relevant articles. The agreement between the three institutions primarily aims at the increased coordination of the legislative process, but we must not forget about the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality either. I would like to point out that according to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU only acts in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action can be better achieved at EU level than at national, regional or local level. It is therefore essential for Community institutions to enable national parliaments to scrutinise legislative proposals by ensuring that the Commission provides a comprehensive and detailed reasoning to decisions concerning subsidiarity and proportionality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
