<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The political situation in the Palestinian Territories is still determined by the progress of the peace process, Israeli actions and activities, and inter-Palestinian divisions.</p>
<p>The improvement of the situation requires, in the Council’s opinion, the fastest possible conclusion of a peace agreement which will allow the creation of a Palestinian State. In this respect, the diplomatic negotiations, held within the framework of the Annapolis process, have been able to lay down the bases for such agreement and the discussions, which involve all issues related to final status, must be pursued. The European Union invites the parties to respect the commitments they entered into as part of the Roadmap, especially, as a priority, a freeze on colonisation, including East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The European Union’s commitment to progress in the negotiations remains total. The Union encourages the Palestinian Authority to continue in its efforts, especially as regards security, in the framework of the implementation of the reform and development plan presented to the Paris Conference (17 December 2007).</p>
<p>The political situation in the Palestinian Territories is also marked by the separation of the West Bank and Gaza. The blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza has led to a critical humanitarian situation on the ground. The European Union calls for the opening of crossing points. The inter-Palestinian dialogue under the aegis of Egypt appears to be progressing. Egypt is currently engaged in a major effort to solve the Palestinian political crisis and to support Palestinian unity under President Abbas. The Council supports this move. The Union must be ready to support any government of national unity which will respect the PLO commitments and which will resolutely undertake negotiations with Israel.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0815"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of the political status of Somaliland has not been examined by the Council. Allow me, however, to offer the following analysis.</p>
<p>First, the international community has not recognised the self-proclaimed independence of this province of four million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Next, the future of this Somali province should be subject to an agreement with the Somali authorities. Should a movement supporting recognition of an independent Somaliland arise, it would be up to the African Union to take the initiative.</p>
<p>Regarding the changes in the province, we can welcome the progress made by the Somaliland regional authorities in the spheres of development and democracy. The European Union encourages these achievements by financial support for the Somaliland regional authorities in their efforts at democratisation (support for voter registration for the forthcoming presidential elections in 2009) and development (projects financed in the framework of the EDF).</p>
<p>The terrorist attacks of 29 October, however, which resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries, are very worrying. The Presidency immediately condemned these horrible attacks.</p>
<p>In this context, I must stress that the restoration of peace in Somalia remains a priority. To this end, we support the implementation of the Djibouti agreement, of 19 August 2008 and the 26 October agreement to cease hostilities between the Federal Transitional Government and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia. The relationship between the EU and the province of Somaliland falls within this framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0817"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is closely following the human rights situation in Iran. It is a situation which is constantly worsening.</p>
<p>Among the many human rights violations in this country, there can be numbered acts of intolerance or discrimination against people on the grounds of their religious persuasion, especially the imposition of restrictions on the freedom of religion or conviction and worship. In recent months, the pressure on members of religious minorities has intensified incessantly. The Presidency has thus been made aware of information about persecution, in various forms, of Christians, followers of Baha'i and Iranian Sunnis.</p>
<p>The situation of converts and apostates is also very worrying. The Iranian Parliament has, indeed, begun a review of the Criminal Code which could lead to apostasy being punishable by the death penalty. The Presidency considers, in its declaration of 26 September 2008, that if this law were adopted in future, it 'would constitute a serious assault on the freedom of religion or conviction, which includes the right to change religion and the right not to have any religion '. Such a law 'would violate article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, freely entered into by Iran', and would threaten the lives of a great many Iranians arrested over the last few months, without legal process, on the basis of their religious convictions.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Council is taking action. On the ground, the embassies of the Member States of the Union have made approaches to the Iranian authorities. We are determined firmly to remind Iran of its international human rights obligations, whenever necessary, whilst hoping that Iran will soon be ready to resume the dialogue with us on these questions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0822"></a>

<p>Identity theft has indeed increased. This worrying phenomenon is especially linked to the development of new technologies and the internet, which facilitates this type of offence.</p>
<p>The fight against cyber crime is one of the priorities of the French Presidency. In July, we presented the Council with a project to draw up a European plan against cyber crime.</p>
<p>This project aims, especially, at setting up a European platform to warn of offences and reinforce the fight against internet terrorist propaganda and recruitment. The plan is based on the conclusions of the European Council of November 2007 and on the Commission communication 'Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime', dated 22 May 2007'.</p>
<p>We also need to ask if the particular case of identity theft would justify the adoption of a regulation. At present, identity theft is not treated as a criminal offence by all Member States. It would be most useful if identity theft were to be made a criminal offence throughout Europe. However, it is up to the Commission, in the framework of it power to initiate legislation, to rule on this question. The Commission has announced that it will undertake consultations to determine if such a regulation is required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0824"></a>

<p>My proposal for a second and extended referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland details the possibility of having a constitutional referendum on Yes or No to the Lisbon Treaty, while on the same day holding consultative referenda on key opt-in/opt-out issues such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Security and Defence Policy. If, in the extended referendum, Irish voters were to opt out of either of the two areas cited above, the Irish Government could then seek a separate agreement at the European Council signed by all 27 Member States, similar to the Danes seeking the Edinburgh Agreement at the Council in December 1992 (which granted Denmark four exemptions to the Maastricht Treaty allowing them to ratify the treaty overall). With this plan, Member States who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty would not have to do so again. This extended plebiscite would offer the Irish electorate a choice as to the extent of the role they want to play within the EU.</p>

<p>Since the referendum, the Irish Government has been actively consulting, both at national level and with the other Member States, to propose a common path to follow. In particular, an intense debate in the Irish Parliament is under way.</p>
<p>As you know, at the European Council of 15-16 October, Prime Minister Brian Cowen presented his analysis of the results of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p>The Irish Government will continue its consultations with the aim of contributing to the creation of the possibility of resolving the situation. On this basis, the European Council agreed to return to this question at its December 2008 meeting, to define the elements of a solution and a common path to follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we should desist from any speculation about possible solutions.</p>
<p>However, as I said to your Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the fringe of the last plenary session, there is some urgency. The Treaty of Lisbon has an objective of helping the Union to act more effectively and more democratically.</p>
<p>Can we wait much longer? The crisis in Georgia proved the contrary. The same goes for the financial crisis. Besides, we have the 2009 deadlines and so the situation must be clarified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0826"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>I wish to say very clearly to Mr Higgins that Burma has most definitely not fallen out of the scope of international monitoring.</p>
<p>I will go further: amongst all the major players, the European Union is by far the most active in maintaining a constant pressure on the regime. For us, the current situation is absolutely unacceptable, and we are acting accordingly. The Council’s recent conclusions, adopted on 10 November, reiterate the European Union’s concern at the lack of noticeable progress in Burma.</p>
<p>What measures are we taking?</p>
<p>- First, we are maintaining our sanctions, although they are constantly being reviewed and refined. They only target the members of the regime and their families and we are doing all we can to avoid affecting the economy and the civilian population.</p>
<p>- However, we have a wider approach. The suffering of the Burmese people has not lessened: to state repression has been added the humanitarian catastrophe of cyclone Nargis, whose consequences remain very serious to this day.</p>
<p>Whilst we are not working alongside the Burmese Government to reconstruct the country, we are working with local NGOs who are independent of the regime in many spheres which are not subject to sanctions. The EU is thus active via numerous projects related to reconstruction and also, in the longer term, to basic education and medical prevention. </p>
<p>- Finally, the situation of the political prisoners, also raised by the honourable Member, remains equally unacceptable. Despite the recent release of a small number of them, their numbers have increased further. Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and nothing indicates that she will be released when this expires in November. Be assured that the European Union is constantly raising this issue at the highest level, for example during the ASEM summit in Beijing on 25 October and in the Council’s conclusions of Monday 10 November. The EU’s special envoy, Mr Fassino, whose mandate was renewed on 28 October, is also working incessantly with all of our partners to maintain international pressure on the Burmese authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0834"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Action Plan ‘An energy policy for Europe’ (2007-2009) was adopted by the European Council on 8-9 March 2007. This action plan notably asks the Member States and the Commission to define ‘the necessary technical, economic and regulatory framework to bring environmentally safe carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to deployment, if possible by 2020.’</p>
<p>On that occasion, the European Council welcomed ‘the Commission's intention to establish a mechanism to stimulate the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 demonstration plants of sustainable fossil fuel technologies in commercial power generation.’</p>
<p>In the framework of this action plan, the proposed directive on the geological storage of carbon is a key element in the climate/energy package. As with the other proposals in the package, we wish to arrive at an agreement at first reading of this text by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, the directive on the geological storage of carbon offers the necessary legal framework for committing to pilot demonstration projects. The Presidency hopes that the trialogues on this proposal, which started on 11 November, will allow us to progress quickly to an agreement on this text.</p>
<p>As you also know, the Presidency, in liaison with Parliament and the Commission, wishes to find a solution to allow financing of the projects, in compliance with the European Council’s commitments. To this end, the Council is examining, with the greatest attention, the innovative proposals for demonstrator financing from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment.</p>
<p>The SET plan approved last year also underlined Europe’s ambition to be a leader in the development of new energy technologies, of which CO2 capture and geological storage technologies clearly form part.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0836"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the Member’s concern with the fight against corruption in various Member States of the European Union. In this connection, the Council draws attention to the fact that many measures have already been taken at European Union level, such as Framework Decision 2003/568/JAI, relating to the fight against corruption in the private sector, and the European Convention of 26 May 1997, relating to the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of the Member States of the European Union, previously mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Council also places great importance on the efforts made at international level. Thus, the position taken by the EU Member States in the negotiation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> was the subject of coordination at Council level. The same goes for the participation of the EU Member States at the Conference of States party to the said convention.</p>
<p>As for the creation of a global mechanism to monitor the fight against corruption within the European Union, the Council is well aware of the need to avoid duplicating what has already been done in the international bodies.</p>
<p>The Council sets particular store by the work of GRECO (the Group of States against Corruption in the Council of Europe), which is performing a sterling task, including the assessment of national policies. In the resolution adopted on 14 April 2005, the Council ‘called on the Commission to consider all viable options, such as participation in the Council of Europe's GRECO (Group of States against Corruption) mechanism, or a mechanism to evaluate and monitor EU instruments, based on the development of a mutual evaluation and monitoring mechanism, avoiding any overlap or duplication’. The Council, then, excludes no option but asks the Commission to continue its deliberations.</p>
<p>Having said that, the most important point is that the measures be implemented in the Member States. It is the Commission which monitors the implementation of disputed actions. In this context, it is useful to mention the last report on the implementation of aforementioned Framework Decision 2003/568/JAI, dated 18 June 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is correct to point out that the Council, as the co-legislator with the European Parliament, adopted, on 18 December 2007, Directive 2007/65/CE ('Audiovisual Media Services Directive'), which updates the legal framework relating to television broadcasting and audiovisual media services in the EU, and that Article 3 of this directive prohibits the broadcast of programmes inciting hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>It appears that the programmes broadcast by Al-Aqsa, to which the honourable Member has drawn our attention, and which were received in the southern regions of the EU and transmitted via satellite equipment located on the territory of a Member State or belonging to this State, fall within the scope of the new directive and the previous directive, 'Television Without Frontiers'.</p>
<p>The Council understands that the Commission has brought this issue to the attention of the regulatory authority of the Member State under whose jurisdiction this broadcast falls, and that the regulatory authority of that State is examining the matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Council has confirmed its determination to meet the ambitious commitments on climate and energy policy it agreed in March 2007 and in March 2008. The European Council also made the invitation, 'bearing in mind the specific situation of each', to ensure 'a satisfactory, rigorously established cost-efficiency ratio'.</p>
<p>On this basis, work continues in the Council’s preparatory bodies. Significant progress has been made on a certain number of questions, but some issues, with a major economic or political impact, are still subject to intense debate within the Council. At the same time, the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the 'energy/climate change' legislative package began in November.</p>

<p>The Council has followed with attention and concern the recent developments in the political situation in Ukraine. The political crisis currently affecting the country is particularly regrettable in the context of the world financial crisis, which is weighing equally heavily on Ukraine, and given the new geopolitical situation created by the conflict in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Council has aired its concerned about the political crisis in Ukraine to the country’s leaders and authorities in EU-Ukraine meetings, including at the summit held on 9 September in Paris. At this summit, the leaders of the EU and Ukraine agreed that political stabilisation, constitutional reform and the consolidation of the rule of law are indispensable conditions for the pursuit of reforms in Ukraine and the deepening of the EU-Ukraine relationship. The summit participants also raised the strategic importance of this relationship and recognised that Ukraine, a European country, shares a common history and values with the countries of the European Union. The future progress of relations between the EU and Ukraine will be based on common values, especially those of democracy, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights and the rights of minorities.</p>
<p>At this summit, it was also decided that the new agreement, currently being negotiated between the European Union and Ukraine, will be an association agreement, which will leave the way open to other progressive developments in the relationship between the two parties. The negotiations on this agreement have progressed rapidly, the two parties working together in a highly constructive manner. This proves that, for Ukraine, rapprochement with the EU is a strategic priority, supported by all of the main political forces and a great majority of its citizens.</p>
<p>The European Union will continue to call on Ukraine’s leaders to find a solution to the current political crisis, based on compromise and respect for democratic principles. It reiterates the importance of respect for the rule of law, an independent judiciary and calls insistently for reform in this sphere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0860"></a>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific mandate – in the meaning of the honourable Member’s question – from the Council to act in the sphere of the trade in textile products. The current situation in this sphere is the result of a series of liberalisations carried out on three successive fronts. First, there was the dismantling of quotas and the end of other specific arrangements, like those in the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC); this agreement expired at the end of 2004. Secondly, other liberalisations were completed in the framework of bilateral agreements with third countries. Finally, the third part of this liberalisation concerns China more particularly. This phase was the subject of thorough negotiations over fifteen years which were consolidated in the provisions of China’s protocol of accession to the WTO in 2001. According to these provisions, from 1 January 2009, a specific basis for trade in textile products from China will no longer exist. With this in mind, the European Parliament, on 25 October 2001, approved China’s protocol of accession.</p>
<p>The 2008 introduction of a double checking system for Chinese textiles products resulted from an agreement with China, which does not wish to extend this system in 2009. Generally speaking, this question is the subject of very regular exchanges with the Commission in the Council’s commercial bodies.</p>
<p>More precisely, the Commission has reported on the situation at the request of the 133 Textiles Committee of 23 September. It presented the conclusion of its analysis to the 133 Committee substitutes on 10 October. It reported that significant increases had been observed in certain product categories, but the global level of imports from China remained stable and the community market was not threatened by the recorded increases. For the Commission, the current situation is in no way comparable with that of 2005, which ended in strong measures. The Commission concludes that there is no need to renew the provision for 2009 and has therefore made no proposals to this effect. It should be stressed, though, that the Council does not have a united position on this question of renewing the measures.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has prepared a notice for importers informing them of the transition process between the current system and the one which comes into force on 1 January.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the representatives of the textile industry, especially at Community level, have not requested an extension of the double checking measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 8 October 2008 the 29 year old militant Engin Çeber, a member of a left-wing organisation in Turkey, died after being savagely tortured in Metris prison in Istanbul. He had been arrested on 28 September together with three companions for distributing their organisation's magazine. This murder is the latest in a long series of other similar acts of criminal violence by the police and parastate paramilitary forces, for instance the shooting by policemen of 17 year-old Ferhat Gerçek for selling the same magazine on the street. He is now disabled for life.</p>

<p>(FR) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and which is not binding on either the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the November 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has been made aware of the tragic events around the death of Mr Çeber, to which the honourable Member refers, and for which the Turkish Minister for Justice has publicly apologised. The competent Turkish authorities have opened an official inquiry into the circumstances of this death and the Council expects this inquiry to be conducted rapidly and with total impartiality.</p>
<p>The Council has always attached great importance to the fight against torture and ill-treatment in Turkey. This question has been the subject of short-term priorities in the revised partnership for membership and has been raised regularly in political dialogue with Turkey, notably during the latest EC-Turkey Association Council in May 2008. The Commission’s recent progress report confirms that Turkey’s legal framework now includes a complete set of protections against these practices, but cases of ill-treatment continue to be reported and obviously constitute a source of concern. It is clear, then, that extra efforts must be agreed by the Turkish authorities to implement, in practice and at all levels, independent mechanisms to prevent torture and so guarantee the policy of 'zero tolerance'.</p>
<p>So that these independent mechanisms may be applied effectively, it is necessary to carry out more thorough inquiries into claims of human rights violations by members of the security forces. At the latest EC-Turkey Association Council, the EU also reminded Turkey that 'it is essential to ratify the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture'.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Council can assure the honourable Member that this question will continue to be monitored very closely and be raised with Turkey in all appropriate bodies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0872"></a>

<p>The development of the European Security and Defence Policy meets the expectations of Europe’s citizens and respects international law. Being a policy whereby the agreement of the participating States is required for operations of a military nature, democratic control in this case resides, in the first instance, with the national parliaments. The reinforcement of the role of the latter at national level is therefore a preferred route for improving the democratic control of the ESDP. It goes without saying that the European Parliament may also express its views under article 21 of the TEU. As for missions of a civilian nature, the European Parliament also plays an important role via the work of its Subcommittee on Security and Defence and the annual vote on the CFSP budget. As for the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is currently going through the procedure for ratification by the Member States, it is not up to the Council to comment on this subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0825"></a>

<p>(EN) Responsibility for ratification of Treaties lies with the Member States who sign them. However, analysis of the Irish referendum has confirmed once again that EU Member States and EU institutions need to work together to strengthen lines of communication between citizens and European policy makers. The EU needs to demonstrate not only what it has achieved and why this makes a real difference to citizens' lives, but also to explain the costs of non-action at European level.</p>
<p>Last week, during a visit to Ireland, the Vice-President of the Commission in charge with Institutional relations and communication strategy worked with the Irish authorities on developing a specific partnership with the Irish authorities to communicate on these issues together. Similar partnerships have been developed with a number of Member States. She is hopeful that a Memorandum of Understanding will be signed with the Irish very soon.</p>
<p>This approach to working together was recently enshrined at political level by the signature on 22 October by Commission, Parliament and Council, of a political agreement on Communicating Europe in Partnership.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed on a common partnership approach to communication. This will give a new boost to cooperation between the EU institutions based on three principles of planning, prioritisation and partnership. It establishes a useful inter-institutional mechanism to share information better, to plan together, centrally and at local level; to identify annually joint communication priorities as well as to cooperate between the communication departments of Member States and EU institutions.</p>
<p>The implementation of the political agreement in practice has already begun, with joint communication priorities for 2009 agreed for the first time ever: the European elections in 2009; energy and climate change and the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain. The Commission has been invited to report back on the implementation of the common communication priorities at the beginning of each year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0829"></a>

<p>(EN) The political declaration signed between the Commission, Parliament and Council on 22 October 2008 fosters cooperation among the European Parliament, Council of the European Union and the Commission on communication about Europe.</p>
<p>The institutions have agreed on a pragmatic partnership approach based on the annual selection of joint communication priorities and practical cooperation between their respective communication departments.</p>
<p>As such, the political declaration is a key instrument in the way to convince public opinion of the benefits of the European Union. This will be especially important in the coming months in the run up to the elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The declaration is not a response to the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, but the result of several years of work and negotiations. The Commission proposed an inter-institutional agreement on which this declaration is based in October 2007, and the idea of a framework for closer co-operation was first raised in the white paper on Communication Policy launched in February 2006.</p>
<p>Implementation has already started. The Commission Representations and the European Parliament Offices in the Member States will closely cooperate with the national administrations in order to organize activities around the selected common communication priorities in 2009 which are: the European elections; energy and climate change; the 20<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe; and sustaining growth, jobs and solidarity.</p>
<p>Concerning the Lisbon Treaty, the Member States are the signatories of the Treaty and have the responsibility for its ratification. The Commission is not part of any campaign for ratification in any Member State.</p>
<p>However, analysis of the referendum results demonstrated a lack of information on the European Union and its policies in Ireland. Therefore, the Commission intends to step up communication and information activities, in particular aimed at people who are less informed or interested in the European dimension of their daily life.

<p>(EN) The Commission is undertaking a series of major changes to make the European Union EUROPA website more user-friendly, navigable and interactive, in line with its policy document 'Communicating Europe via the Internet: engaging the citizens' adopted on 21 December 2007<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>An independent evaluation of the EUROPA website carried out for the Commission in 2007 concluded that most of the web visitors found the information they were looking for (85%). However, they also found that it took too long to find this information and that there was a need therefore to present it in a less complex and more coherent way.</p>
<p>The ongoing changes include both the revamping of the EU homepage and the homepage of the Commission and should be achieved by mid-2009. Definition of a new navigational structure will make the pages easier to read and ensure that they focus more on particular user groups (eg general public, business) and popular tasks (eg funding, events). Improvements will be tested on focus groups before the launch and users will be able to leave feedback and suggestions. An improved version of the search engine on the Commission homepage has already been launched. The EU press room has also been revamped.</p>
<p>The Commission has also improved its internal structure of cooperation. Directorate-General Communication works closely together with the internet editors of each of the Commission services in the framework of the network created as part of the Commission's new internet strategy. The work of this network focuses on improving individual websites of the Commission services and encouraging the exchange of good practice between editors.</p>
<p>Inter-institutional cooperation takes places on a regular basis through the inter-institutional internet committee (Comité éditorial interinstitutionel - CEIII). The committee deals with both technical and content matters and looks at ways of improving the experience of the user on the EU's websites. One area currently being explored is the possibility of having a common search feature for all institutions allowing users to retrieve information on EU affairs in an easier way.</p>
<p>At the CEIII meeting on 2 October 2008, the Parliament presented its new European elections website to be launched in January 2009. The Commission will reserve a prominent place for coverage on the EP elections on the EUROPA homepage, including links to the EP elections website.</p>
<p>Concerning ensuring that legislation can be easily and conveniently tracked throughout its evolution from draft to adoption, the Commission would like to stress the importance of the PRELEX webpages available on EUROPA<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which offers an exhaustive and appreciated information.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) CERN is an international organisation set up in 1954 to conduct research in Nuclear and Particle Physics. It conducts research under the auspices of the 20 member countries of the CERN Council, including 18 EU Member States and 2 Non-EU States. Those 20 countries jointly provide CERN's annual operation and investment budget. The EC has only an observer status in the CERN Council. It does not participate in the decision-making process and does not contribute to the annual budget.</p>
<p>Like any other research organisation, CERN has the possibility to participate in calls organised under the Community's Framework Programme for Research. CERN has participated in a number of calls under successive Framework Programmes, submitting joint proposals with various other European research organisations.</p>
<p>Under FP6 and FP7, the EC has so far provided about € 60 million to CERN for its participation in projects selected on the basis of competitive calls. These projects aim among others at the joint development of a European Grid computing infrastructure, at the joint development of future accelerator and detector design, or at joint training programmes for young researchers. These projects have indirectly also helped CERN in its efforts towards building the LHC collider.</p>
<p>The EC has learned that CERN has conducted an inquiry into the cause of the accident that occurred on September 19, 2008. CERN concludes that the cause of the incident was a faulty electrical connection between two of the accelerator’s magnets. This resulted in mechanical damage and release of helium from the magnet cold mass into the tunnel. CERN announced that they plan to restart the LHC in spring 2009. Further request for information about the causes of the accident and measures to be taken can best be obtained directly from the CERN Council and its Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) As a result of the efforts undertaken within the 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6, 2002-2006) in the field of translational cancer research (i.e. translating basic science results into clinical applications), 108 research projects are being supported for a global amount of € 485 million. These projects tackle, with a multidisciplinary approach, different issues relating to prevention, early diagnosis, understanding of cancer and identifying drug targets as well as therapeutic strategies and novel technology and palliative care<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the report of the EUROCAN+PLUS<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> feasibility study, presented at the European Parliament in February 2008, called for increased coordination and guidance of translational and clinical research, including management of networks and a platform of comprehensive cancer centres.</p>
<p>Pursuant to these efforts, the Specific Programme 'Cooperation' of the 7th Framework Programme for Research (FP7, 2007-2013), has - under the theme 'Health' - set a priority to further reinforce translational cancer research towards clinical applications and address fragmentation, taking into account the outcome of EUROCAN+PLUS and the recommendations of the European Council conclusions on 'Reducing the burden of cancer'<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> as well as the Parliament Resolution on 'Combating cancer in the enlarged European Union'<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the 2007 calls for proposals have addressed recommended research areas, such as screening, end-of-life care and fragmentation of research efforts regarding cancer registries through the ERA-NET scheme<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>For the next call for proposals of the Health theme, to be published in 2009, it is expected to further address fragmentation by stimulating the development of coordinated translational cancer research programmes in Europe and address rare and childhood cancers research, the latter building on an important portfolio of initiatives developed under FP6 (such as KidsCancerKinome, EET-Pipeline, Conticanet, Siopen-R-Net, etc.). This will be complemented by initiatives aimed at supporting off-patent medicines for paediatric use in a concerted effort with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA)<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is considering the future EU actions on cancer - European platform, to share best practices and support Member States in their efforts to tackle more efficiently cancer by bringing together the full range of stakeholders into a concerted action. The Commission has also just adopted proposals for a European strategy on rare diseases in general<a href="#defann_25_7" name="refann_25_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, and the cooperation and greater efficiency facilitated by those actions should also help to facilitate research in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The decision by the Sri Lankan Government for United Nations (UN) and international aid organisations to withdraw from the conflict area was based on security considerations. Following the withdrawal, the Commission and other humanitarian actors pressed for the establishment of a system of safe humanitarian convoys with food and other essential supplies to reach people in need in the Vanni. They also insisted on independent observers being allowed to accompany the convoys to ensure that supplies reach those in need without discrimination. Both sides to the conflict agreed. Four convoys travelling under the UN flag have now successfully reached the Vanni, both delivering much needed food from World Food Programme (WFP). Regular convoys are planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been allowed to continue their activities with international staff in the Vanni. ICRC plays a crucial role through having lines of communication with both parties to the conflict and also provides much needed assistance such as shelter and essential household items. The Commission will continue to support both ICRC and WFP operations. Funding to the two agencies in Sri Lanka in 2008 is currently €5.5 million. If necessary the Commission could consider the possibility of further humanitarian funding to these agencies later in the year.</p>
<p>It is clear however that more needs to be done in terms of ensuring that sufficient aid reaches the population in need. The Commission estimates that only around 45% of food needs are actually being met at this time. In addition there is an urgent need for shelter materials for the displaced people, given the approaching monsoon season The Commission will continue to argue for increased access to the Vanni, not only for UN agencies but also for those International non-governmental organisations who, were forced to withdraw in September, since these organisations play a key role in the provision of humanitarian relief.</p>
<p>In terms of ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected the Commission will continue to take every opportunity to remind both parties to the conflict of their obligations in this regard and to advocate for a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0804"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission implements the EU’s humanitarian aid via partners who are either international organisations or non-governmental organisations based in the EU. These humanitarian organisations are contractually responsible for managing humanitarian aid financed by the EU.</p>
<p>A set of inspection and monitoring systems has been introduced to ensure the correct implementation of the financed operations, at the various stages in the lifecycle of a humanitarian operations project. The main features are described below:</p>
<p>- Rigorous mechanisms of selection and quality control are introduced by the Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) signed with the European NGOs and the international organisations;</p>
<p>- The systems used to identify which actions are financed are based strictly on the real needs which have to be met;</p>
<p>- The projects are inspected by a worldwide network of field experts (technical assistants) working for the Commission. These Humanitarian Aid specialists are permanently in the field to facilitate and maximise the impact of the humanitarian operations financed by the Commission, in whatever country or region;</p>
<p>- The partners have to provide intermediate and final reports and justify their expenses;</p>
<p>- The Commission regularly assesses its humanitarian operations;</p>
<p>- The activities financed by the Commission and implemented by the humanitarian organisations are subject to financial audits carried out both at the headquarters of the Commission’s partners for finalised projects (every two years) and in the field for current projects. For example, the Commission has verified a third of the expenses claims submitted for humanitarian projects in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>At the start of September, subsequent to the lifting of the suspension of NGO field activities, which was ordered by the Government in June, the partners are reporting few access problems, and food distribution has been able to resume.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0816"></a>

<p>(FR) The European Consensus on Development underlines the crucial role of gender equality in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In its work on education, the Commission gives priority to the achievement of MDG 2 on universal primary education and MDG 3 on gender equality. Consequently, the sectoral programmes implemented with the partner countries pay equal attention to the participation of girls at all levels in the education system.</p>
<p>In Egypt, in the poorest regions, girls receive little schooling and have high dropout rates. These problems are addressed by the Girls’ Education Initiative, led by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM). This national plan, which focuses on primary education, has, as its principal objectives, the improvement of the quality of basic education for girls and facilitating their access thereto.</p>
<p>In other countries, such as Burkina Faso and Tanzania, the Commission is supporting the reform of the whole education sector, in coordination with the other funding providers. In parallel, the EC is undertaking a dialogue with the sector to influence certain choices and priorities and to assess the results of the reform via key indicators. Amongst these indicators may be cited, for Burkina, the 'Gross rate of female primary education' and the 'Number of literate females'. In Tanzania, the focus is on the number of female teachers and the creation of a school environment that promotes girls’ education.</p>
<p>A growing number of countries are receiving support which allows them to develop social protection programmes which, by distributing money or food to the most vulnerable families, mean that families do not have to consider the cost of educational opportunities for their daughters.</p>
<p>Finally, in its higher education mobility programmes (webpage on the Erasmus Mundus programme on external cooperation and on the future Mwalimu Julius Nyerere programme), the Commission has set itself the objective of 50% female recipients.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0831"></a>

<p>The EU remains by large the world's main donor of humanitarian aid funding and accounted for 46.8% of the global humanitarian aid contributions in 2007 (of which 13.7% funding from the EC and 33.1 % funding from Member States).</p>
<p>The amount of the humanitarian assistance provided by the Commission is defined in the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007-2013. The annual amount available for humanitarian aid is around € 750 million per year. These funds can be topped up from the Emergency Aid Reserve of around € 240 million a year in the case of unforeseen events occurring during the year. The conditions for mobilization of the Emergency Aid Reserve set out in the Inter-Institutional Agreement between the Parliament, Council and the Commission are quite strict and cover aid requirements of non-member countries following events which could not be foreseen when the budget was established. The amount of humanitarian assistance provided by the EC remained quite stable over recent years and with deference to rights of the budget authority, is likely to remain within the MFF.</p>
<p>In the year 2008 the funds available to the Humanitarian aid and the Food Aid budget line managed by the EC have been supplemented by € 180 million due to the increase in food, fuel and commodity prices, with funds, mainly, coming from the Emergency Aid Reserve.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Commissioner Louis Michel has on various occasions expressed his support for the transfer of sustainable energy generation technology to developing countries. This is crucial in the interests of environmental justice and as a part of the global approach to climate change. However, in practice certain mechanisms – such as intellectual property rights – are evidently delaying and/or preventing this transfer of sustainable technology to the South.</p>
<p>What action is the Commission taking, or proposing to take, to combat these obstacles in practice so as to ensure that this technology transfer actually gets started?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission recognises the importance of an intellectual property rights (IPR) system which operates appropriately in developing countries. This system is a necessary framework for promoting technology transfer, as commercial companies would be little inclined to transfer technology to countries where there are weak, poorly applied intellectual property rights regulations.</p>
<p>However, in a certain number of cases, the intellectual property rights regulations must take into account the concerns of developing countries, especially where patents increase the price of products essential to development. This is the case, for example, with medicines: the Commission has been at the forefront of international initiatives to provide developing countries with access to vital medicines at affordable prices.</p>
<p>That said, in the sustainable energy production sector (photovoltaic, biomass and wind power), there is no clear evidence that intellectual property rights have had a negative impact on development and technology transfer. The patents to the underlying technologies are long-expired and a number of patented products are competing, bringing down the cost of these technologies. There is also competition between the various technologies used to produce electricity. If companies in the developing countries wish to enter this field of new technologies as producers, they can obtain affordable operating licences. Companies in India and China, for example, have already entered the photovoltaic energy market. Perhaps in the biomass area, exclusive operating rights for the new biotechnologies might cause a problem. In practice, however, customs duty and other barriers to trade form greater obstacles.</p>
<p>In fact, many modern products or technologies are expensive not because of intellectual property rights but simply because of the complexity of the way they are produced, the high cost of materials and the high costs of installation and operation, often magnified by the lack of local skills. </p>
<p>This is why the Commission provides developing countries with major funds to promote the use of sustainable energy production technologies, especially via the ACP<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>-EU Energy Facility, launched in 2006. This is why the Facility, which covers all the sources of renewable energy, finances projects which go beyond the mere introduction of new technology and deal with issues of the skills needed to adapt, operate, maintain and propagate the technologies.</p>
<p>The facility should be replenished with almost EUR 200 million in the framework of the tenth European Development Fund (EDF). These funds will aim more particularly at renewable energy sources, thus allowing greater access at local level to sustainable energy supplies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) This issue of the effects of the current financial crisis on development cooperation is particularly relevant in light of the follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, taking place between 29 November and 2 December in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on 29 October 2008, the Commission published a communication entitled 'From financial crisis to recovery', which emphasises, among other things, the importance of sharing the benefits of sustainable growth and meeting the challenge of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>In Doha, one of the main issues in the conclusions the European Union plans to present is the firm reaffirmation of its commitment to increase the levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), to achieve a collective ODA of 0.56% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2010 and 0.7% of GDP by 2015. The Member States are drawing up rolling multi-annual indicative timetables to illustrate how they will achieve the ODA objective.</p>
<p>Despite the financial crisis, this commitment is not in question. On the contrary, in a time of crisis, it is very important to maintain the levels of ODA. Experience shows that reducing ODA has a direct correlation with increased levels of extremism and world instability.</p>
<p>Therefore, the EU, the biggest ODA donor with, in 2007, no less than USD 61.5 billion allocated, out of a world total of 104 billion, invites all the other donors to contribute development financing in an equitable manner, to increase their Official Development Assistance to the target 0.7% of GDP and urges all the other donors to draw up rolling multi-annual indicative timetables to illustrate how they will achieve these objectives.</p>
<p>Whilst ODA is the pillar of development, it is not the only solution. More work is needed on innovative sources of financing, especially related to implementation. The new challenges, particularly the reduction of and adaptation to climate change, food and energy security and financing needed to respond thereto, must be dealt with. Good economic and financial governance, including the fight against fraud, corruption and tax evasion, must be sustained and, finally, we must work on a real reform of the international financial system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0853"></a>

<p>(FR) The improvement of maternal health and maternal mortality has been a constant concern of the Commission in its work on health and development. Despite all our efforts, however, MDG 5 is probably the most difficult MDG to achieve. The European Union has doubled its efforts in 2008 to mark a real turning point in the international community’s actions to promote the MDGs and to set the objective of progressing from policy declarations to practical actions.</p>
<p>What is being done in practical terms?</p>
<p>The actions financed on the budget lines (European Development Fund (EDF) and General Budget) are designed to have lasting effects on the national health system policies. It is difficult to differentiate between the contributions of the EDF and the budget for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) which are usually dealt with as support to the health sector in general or which may be designated as priority sectors or, more often, in the wider framework of activities such as 'macro-economic support'. According to a (non exhaustive) inventory recently carried out by the Commission, in the framework of bilateral regional cooperation agreements between 2002 and 2008, around EUR 150 million was allocated to the financing of projects with a significant reproductive health component.</p>
<p>In the framework of the reproductive health thematic lines (2003-2006), over EUR 73 million was allocated to sexual and reproductive health and rights policies and actions in developing countries. </p>
<p>As for the tenth EDF, we are planning directly to support the health sector in 31 developing countries<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The countries benefitting from our activities have very high maternal mortality rates and extremely weak health systems. In addition, to make the aid more predictable, the Commission is introducing a new financial instrument, the so-called ‘MDG contract’, in a number of partner countries, in whose framework the budget support will be tied, in the long term, to the concrete results achieved in the MDGs. This makes it easier for governments to bear the recurrent costs relating to health systems, such as the salaries of medical staff, which is vital if one wishes to increase access to primary health care, including childbirth services, which is essential for MDG 5.</p>
<p>Despite everything, what is currently being done to improve maternal health is far from sufficient. Greater effort, therefore, is necessary if the situation is to be changed This is why the Council of the European Union adopted, on 24 June, the EU MDG Action Plan, in which the Commission and the Member States commit (amongst other things) to increase their support to the health sector in developing countries by an extra EUR 8 million by 2010 (of which EUR 6 million is allocated to Africa).</p>
<p>As for MDG 5, the EU MDG Action Plan mentions two major objectives to be achieved by 2010:</p>
<p>1) 21 million more births attended by qualified health staff</p>
<p>2) 50 million more women in Africa with access to modern contraceptives</p>
<p>Finally, we also have the ‘Investing in human resources’ Instrument in which EUR 44 million is allocated to the implementation of the Cairo agenda on reproductive health for 2009 and 2010. Part of these funds will be used to finance NGO projects in the partner countries.</p>
<p>The Commission does not plan to continue to make up for the 'decency gap' beyond 2008 by giving extra financing to the IPPF<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the UNFPA<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, due to the various instruments, explained above, already at its disposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The aviation sector has experienced extremely dynamic development in recent years, and aviation is becoming an increasingly important means of transport.</p>
<p>Given that aviation currently produces 3% of total CO2 emissions in Europe and this trend will continue to rise, consideration must be given to the introduction of a kerosene tax.</p>
<p>From the point of view of environment policy, it makes sense to levy a tax on aviation fuel, at least within the EU's borders. This is the only way of guaranteeing a more environmentally friendly approach to aviation fuel.</p>
<p>Other fossil fuels are also subject to tax, and the situation should be harmonised.</p>
<p>Even minor additional costs to passengers would produce added value for the environment, so that a light tax on kerosene would benefit both the environment and consumers.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission sets out its position with respect to taxation of aviation fuel in its 2005 Communication on Reducing the Climate Change Impact of Aviation<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This reaffirmed the Commission's preference for normalising the treatment of aviation fuel as soon as possible within the international legal framework governing aviation.</p>
<p>Under Council Directive 2003/96/EC<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Member States can already introduce fuel taxation for domestic flights. Subject to mutual agreement, fuel taxation can also be introduced for flights between two Member States under this Directive.</p>
<p>However, in practical terms, Member States face difficulties in taxing kerosene because doing so would introduce a competitive distortion between EU and non-EU airlines. This is because there are legally binding tax exemptions in bilateral air service agreements between Member States and non-EU countries. These make it difficult to apply fuel taxation on intra-Community routes where non-EU carriers have traffic rights and continue to enjoy tax exemptions under the relevant bilateral agreements.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively working to renegotiate the terms of these bilateral air services agreements with non-EU countries in order to open the possibility of taxing fuel supplied to EU and non-EU carriers on an equal basis. However, it is recognised that this process will inevitably take time. So far almost 450 bilateral agreements have been amended to this effect through negotiations with non-EU countries.</p>
<p>Given these difficulties, the wider application of energy taxes to aviation can not be relied upon as the key pillar of a strategy to combat the climate change impact of aviation in the short and medium term.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission has closely monitored last October’s shipping accidents involving the FEDRA and the TAWE. The Commission is especially pleased that all the sailors on the FEDRA were saved, despite the difficult weather conditions.</p>
<p>The services of the Commission, especially the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), part of the Directorate-General for the Environment in charge of civil defence, were in close contact with the Spanish and British authorities.</p>
<p>In response to requests from the Spanish authorities, satellite images were provided via the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to detect any oil pollution in the Bay of Algeciras. In addition, via the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), Spain decided to mobilise one of the anti-pollution vessels under contract to EMSA. This vessel, the BAHIA TRES, operating under the command of the Spanish authorities, was able to recover around 50 tonnes of oil.</p>
<p>More widely, the Commission points out that the European Union has introduced ambitious maritime safety and marine environment protection policies. The new initiatives in the third maritime safety package will bring major improvements, for example, in traffic monitoring and operator liability.</p>

<p>In October 2008 two Liberian-registered cargo ships were involved in accidents near the coasts of the Strait of Gibraltar. The worst was prevented by the helpful and effective action of the European Maritime Safety Agency. However, these repeated accidents, plus the growing transport of hazardous goods by sea, give renewed urgency to the issue of tightening the safety rules governing all the European Union’s sea straits and to the question of how to ensure these rules are respected. In particular, such straits and their approach routes should be classified as ‘Seveso areas’.</p>
<p>What specific measures does the Commission propose to take to enhance the safety of sea straits in the Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, ships enjoy the right of transit passage, which shall not be impeded, in international straits. This does not prevent States bordering the straits from taking measures to ensure safety at sea. Member States therefore monitor maritime traffic in the principal straits of the Union, such as Gibraltar, through maritime traffic services (MTS), to which shipping routes and ship’s log systems can be linked.</p>
<p>Within the European Union, since the Prestige accident, several steps have been taken to reinforce the battery of Community legislation on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships. Thus the implementation of Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system has led to improved monitoring of shipping and sharing of information between Member States concerning hazardous cargos.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission adopted a third package of seven measures on maritime safety in November 2005, in order to cement this work by bolstering the existing range of preventive measures, while at the same time developing procedures to ensure better responses to the consequences of accidents. In particular, this package includes a strengthening of the provisions relating to the monitoring of maritime traffic.</p>
<p>With regard to averting the risk of maritime pollution, the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in combating pollution caused by ships is a significant measure providing Member States with not inconsiderable operational assistance. For this purpose EMSA has formed the CleanSeaNet service.</p>
<p>The EU/ESA Kopernikus initiative supports an important improvement to the current CleanSeaNet oil spill monitoring activity. In the MARCOAST project the added oil spill movement hind- and forecast components will significantly help rescue work and tracing spill sources. These services will be carried over into the future Kopernikus programme to sustain them for a long term. From 2011 onwards the Kopernikus Sentinel 1 satellite missions will sustain crucial earth observation infrastructure by continuing monitoring after ESA's ENVISAT mission.</p>
<p>As regards classifying maritime straits and their approach routes as ‘Seveso zones’, the Seveso directive (Directive 96/82/EC) applies only to establishments where hazardous substances are present. The transport of hazardous substances by sea is excluded from the scope of the directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0849"></a>

What is the Commission doing to stop these calls for supranational State aid that risks creating protectionism?</p>

<p>(EN) In order to face the financial crisis, the Commission has assessed and approved the emergency rescue packages decided by Member States in favour of their financial institutions according to existing State aid rules in a very short period of time, with the aim to prevent negative spill-over effects from the financial sphere to the whole economy.</p>
<p>With a view to alleged risks, such as any move towards new State aid that would result in distortions of competition or more protectionism, the Commission wishes to recall that the current State aid framework will fully remain in force. Any measure proposed by Member States would therefore need to continue complying with this framework.</p>
<p>In this context, it should be noted that State aids granted to financial institutions within this framework are supposed to have a positive impact on other sectors, in the sense that they aim at stabilizing the financial relations between economic operators. This however cannot be understood as relaxing existing State aid rules and practices: Member States’ rescue aid packages for their financial markets were designed in a way so as to limit state intervention to the strict minimum and with special regards to Internal Market rules.</p>
<p>In that sense, the car industry is already benefitting indirectly via the state aid towards the banking sector. The continued application of the State aid rules will ensure that no undue distortions of competition are taking place. Every measure to be proposed to support this sector will have to comply with this: Either it does not constitute State aid in the first place, or it has to be State aid that complies with the existing rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0852"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission informs the honourable Member that in accordance with Article 149 of the EC Treaty the support for young children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties is a competence of the Member States.</p>
<p>However, within the Education and Training 2010–work programme the support for students with any kind of special educational needs is an integral part of all European initiatives and activities.</p>
<p>The 2006 Recommendation of the Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning (2006/962/EC) recommends Member States to ensure that appropriate provision is made for those who due to educational disadvantage – thus including learning difficulties - need particular support to fulfil their educational potential.</p>
<p>In its Communication on Improving the Quality of Teacher Education<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission stresses the need to equip teachers with skills to identify the specific needs of each individual learner, and respond to them by deploying a wide range of teaching strategies.</p>
<p>Both the Recommendation and the Communication are now followed up by expert groups through the Open Method of Coordination.</p>
<p>The annual reports 'Progress towards the Lisbon Objectives in Education and Training' provide Member States with comparable data on the provision for those students with Special Educational Needs.</p>
<p>The 2008 Commission Communication Improving Competences for the 21<span class="sup">st</span> Century: An Agenda for Cooperation on Schools<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> states that support for those with special needs implies, inter alia, re-thinking of policies for organising learning support, and collaboration between schools and other services. In that same document, the Commission proposes that future cooperation between Member States should focus on providing timely support and personalised learning approaches within mainstream schooling with students with special needs.</p>
<p>In 2009 the Commission will propose what concrete steps could be taken in the future, in the framework of the Open Method of Coordination, to address these issues.</p>
<p>In addition, Pupils with dyslexia or other learning difficulties are also able to benefit from Commission support programmes.</p>
<p>Within the Lifelong Learning Programme<a href="#defann_42_3" name="refann_42_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, it is clearly recognised that there is a need to widen access for those from disadvantaged groups and to address actively the special learning needs of those with disabilities in the implementation of all parts of the programme. Article 12 recognised also that in implementing the Programme, due regard shall be paid to making provision for learners with special needs, and in particular by helping to promote their integration into mainstream education and training.</p>
<p>In addition, among the various ICT-oriented research projects selected by the EC for receiving funding under the e-inclusion / e-accessibility topic for the last 15 years, initially in the TIDE initiative and since in the Framework Programmes 4, 5, 6 and now 7, the support to persons with learning difficulties in particular children and specifically with dyslexia has been regularly targeted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the Jean Monnet programme, the Commission supports the European Agency for the Development of Special Needs Education and works closely with it in order to help Member States to create adequate support systems for those with special needs, and, in particular, to promote their inclusion in mainstream settings.<a href="#defann_42_4" name="refann_42_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, equal access to education for persons with disabilities is also one of the priorities of the EU Disability Action Plan as referred to in the recent Communication on the situation of disabled persons in the European Union<a href="#defann_42_5" name="refann_42_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. This is fully in line with the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities that has been signed by the Community and all the Member States. Article 24 of the Convention contains clear obligations to realize the right to education of person with disabilities without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunities among others by ensuring an inclusive education system at all levels.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening (2003/878/EC) recognises that for breast, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer sufficient evidence exists to recommend population-based, organised screening in all EU Member States and high quality should be assured at all steps of the screening process.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively following development within cancer research and in particular the impact of population-based prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian screening on cancer mortality. It is true that screening tests are available for many types of cancers, but before introducing new screening tests their effectiveness has to be adequately evaluated and demonstrated.</p>
<p>By the end of November the Commission intends to present the first Report on the Implementation of the Council Recommendation. It will be based on the external Report<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> prepared by the European Cancer Network and the European Network for Information on Cancer, that was presented earlier in 2008 and shows that despite the efforts we are less then half way towards implementing the existing Council Recommendation. Slightly less than half of the population who should be covered by screening according to Recommendation actually are; and less than half of those examinations are performed as part of screening programmes meeting the stipulations of the Recommendation. Even with the current volume of activities, the current expenditure in human and financial resources is already considerable.</p>
<p>The scale of these resources and the challenge of maintaining an appropriate balance between benefits and harms of screening call for identifying appropriate and effective measures to assure the quality, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of current and future screening activities. Regular, systematic investigation, monitoring, evaluation and EU-wide status reporting on implementation of cancer screening programmes will continue to support exchange of information on successful developments and to identify weak points requiring improvement.</p>
<p>Finally the Commission is actively considering the future EU actions on cancer – in particular, the possibility of establishing a European platform, to share best practice and support Member States in their efforts to more efficiently tackle cancer by bringing together a full range of stakeholders into a common initiative with a common commitment to addressing cancer. This is also one of the priority initiatives of the European Commission for 2009. A brainstorming workshop was held on 29 October 2008 with invited stakeholders to discuss how to structure such a multi-stakeholder platform and to identify immediate areas and actions to be addressed within such a framework, including the area of cancer screenings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The International Maritime Organization, at its 58<span class="sup">th</span> Maritime Environment Protection Committee meeting (6-10 October 2008), adopted amendments to the legislation on air pollution from ships, MARPOL Annex VI. Pursuant to the amendment, the emission of oxides of sulphur will be reduced up to 93% in special control areas by 2015 and by 85% worldwide by 2020. Also the emissions of oxides of nitrogen will be reduced up to 80% in special areas from 2016. Unlike the successful adoption of measures to reduce air pollution, the IMO has made little progress on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes these amendments as they represent an important reduction of air pollution from ships that will significantly improve human health and the environment. Whilst ships are in general energy efficient, up to now little effort has been made to reduce air pollution and the MARPOL amendment will bridge an important part of the gap in environmental performance between ships and other modes of transport.</p>
<p>The newly agreed emission limits are goal based so ship operators will have the choice on how to comply with the new emission standards. To comply with the standards for oxides of sulphur, options include the use of low sulphur fuel or abatement technology; whilst for nitrogen oxides the options are either 'in engine' modifications or abatement technology.</p>
<p>As to the possible negative consequences for short sea shipping, the Commission will shortly commission a study on the economic impacts and possible negative modal shift, followed by a more extensive study that will also look at broader trade impacts.</p>

<p>(EN) According to Article 152(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, 'Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.' As a consequence, the adoption of rules governing rights and duties relating to healthcare organisation and financing is a national responsibility, provided, nevertheless, that such rules comply with general EC law, in particular on competition (such as rules on State aid) and the internal market.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is recalled that Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty foresees the non-application of EC rules if the application of such rules obstructs the performance of the services of general economic interest (hereinafter SGEI). In line with community case-law, Member States have a wide margin of discretion to classify services as being SGEI, and health services appear typically to fall under this category.</p>
<p>Moreover, in July 2005, the Commission adopted the SGEI 'package' in order to provide greater legal certainty for financing services of general economic interest by specifying the conditions under which the compensation to companies for the provision of public services is compatible with State aid rules. The SGEI package is composed of a 'Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation'<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and of a Commission decision 'on the application of Article 86(2) of the Treaty to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest'<span class="sup"> </span><a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The three conditions underscoring the compatibility of compensation for SGEI in the 'package' derive from Article 86(2) EC and namely are: clear public service definition; transparency and objectivity of the compensation; absence of over-compensation of the discharge of the public service.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2005 Commission decision, State aid compensating hospitals for the costs incurred in the provision of services of general economic interest entrusted to them benefits from derogation to the notification obligation under Article 88(3) EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) During the last two years, 350.000 employment posts have been lost in the textile and clothing sector which represents a decrease of 15% of the textile employment in Europe compared to 2005. The number of companies was reduced by 5% during the same period. This evolution results from a variety of factors, notably delocalisation and the restructuring process. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the honourable Member with a breakdown by Member States for the year 2008. For 2007 preliminary data on the number of enterprises and the number of persons employed are available from structural business statistics for a few Member States. 2006 is the latest year for which data from this source is available for all Member States with the exception of Malta. Preliminary data currently available indicate that the production has remained stable in the past two years.</p>
<p>On the second question, the Commission presumes that the honourable Member is referring to discussions which the Commission and the Member States have had in the run up to the end of the double checking surveillance system. During the discussions, there have been a variety of requests ranging from single checking surveillance to simple customs monitoring, with most Member States expressing themselves on the different options. Finally, the option of full liberalisation with a monitoring of the trade flows was taken as the way forward for 2009. Indeed the Commission will continue to follow closely the evolution of the actual trade statistics (Comext) and the customs data in 2009.</p>
<p>On import evolution from China in 2008<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> compared to 2007 and 2004, the statistics show that imports from China for the ten categories have increased on average by 50.8% in 2008 over 2007 (with increase variations for single categories from 11.1% for Category 115 to 105.9% for Category 5). Comparisons between 2008 and 2004 show an average increase of 305.6% (with increase variation from 104.9% for Category 2 to 545.1% for Category 6).</p>
<p>These figures should also be seen within the wider context of the total textiles and clothing imports both from all EU suppliers and from China. For both periods above, the increases are much more moderate. Total textiles and clothing imports from China increased by 6.6% in 2008 over 2007 and by 76.6% in 2008 over 2004. Total textiles and clothing imports from all EU suppliers including China increased by 1.8% in 2008 over 2007 and by 16.4% in 2008 over 2004. Moreover, imports in the ten categories from all suppliers including China have increased by a moderate 5.1% in 2008 over 2007 and by 29% in 2008 over 2004. All in all, it is in this context that the imports from China should be analysed.</p>
<p>As for 2009, China does not wish to continue the double checking surveillance system. At any rate, it is the Commission's view that the purpose of smooth transition in 2008 has been achieved. In 2009, close following of the evolution of the actual trade statistics (Comext) and the customs data will continue but textile trade needs now to be liberalised. Indeed after the extra years of protection since 2005, the EU industry has understood the need to enhance its competitiveness through restructuring and there are no objective reasons to continue to treat textile sector as special sector indefinitely. The question is not how to avoid 2005 in 2009; the question is the sector has to compete in a liberalized environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The policy of the EU and the Greek Government, based on the recent CAP reforms including those resulting from the CAP 'health check' and within the framework of the WTO agreements, has undermined the agricultural sector with devastating effects on small and medium-sized farms, while ensuring mouth-watering profits for big business. Prices for basic agricultural commodities in Greece have been driven through the floor. For example, prices have fallen to 12 cents per kilo for maize, 25 cents for cotton and less than 30 cents for durum wheat. The price of extra virgin oil has fallen to 2.37 Euros per kilo, which does not even cover the cost of production. With the agreement of the ND and Pasok Governments, EU farm subsidies for most products are no longer linked to production and have remained frozen at the 2000-2002 three-year average.</p>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member links the recent price decrease of certain agricultural products in Greece to the Commission's strategy towards further decoupling, and the recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. In fact, as all analyses, internal and external, demonstrate, these price developments are more related to world market developments and the adjustment of commodity prices to levels below the exceptional ones we have seen over the last year.</p>
<p>The Commission underlines that, while the recent price developments have had differential effects for farmers across the EU, the level of prices varied among products but still remained above the 2000-2003 average. Therefore the relevant price variations in Greece should be addressed within this context.</p>
<p>Even in times where both input prices and the prices farmers could get for their products have increased and farmers could achieve high incomes through the market, Commission has always pointed out that, while many farmers have been able to profit, others have been rather negatively affected because they were more vulnerable to increases in the prices of inputs.</p>
<p>What is important is that farmers are given clear signals far in advance that will enable them to plan their future activities. In the EU, this is guaranteed by allowing them to adjust their production to the signals markets give them and, simultaneously, providing them significant income support through decoupled direct payments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0869"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not aware of the case of police brutality in Greece which the honourable Member refers to.</p>
<p>Police systems in all EU Member States should be characterised by democratic control, respect of individual rights, transparency, integrity and responsibility to the public. The Commission therefore deeply regrets that the intervention of law enforcement authorities could possibly be linked to the death of one person.</p>
<p>Under the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the Commission has no general power to intervene in the field of fundamental rights or the day-to-day running of the national criminal justice systems.

For this reason, it is not possible for the Commission to take action on this matter.</p>
<p>If the alleged victims of police brutality are not satisfied with the answer given by the Greek courts and believe that their rights have been infringed, they may lodge a complaint with the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights (Council of Europe, 67075 Strasbourg-Cedex, France<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).

<p>The Greek Government, bowing to ongoing pressure from multinational retailers seeking to tighten their grip on the market, is pushing for the introduction of Sunday trading, a move which will make it impossible for small undertakings and the self-employed to compete and will drive them out of business. At the same time the multinational giants are seeking a wider deregulation of opening hours. The introduction of Sunday trading, together with already deregulated arrangements regarding opening hours, will give these companies unlimited freedom to further exploit their workers and further encroach upon the minimal amount of free time they are able to devote to leisure and social activities and their personal lives.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree with the proposed extension of opening hours and the erosion of the right to Sunday rest which has been won by workers? Does it not consider that such a move will simply serve to strengthen the market hold of multinationals, while having a devastating impact on thousands of workers, driving the self-employed out of business and resulting in the closure of thousands of small undertakings?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would recall that the Working Time Directive<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> guarantees the right to a minimum weekly rest period for all workers<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in the European Community. Under the Directive, all Member States must ensure that for each seven-day period, every worker is entitled to a minimum uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, Community labour law does not prescribe that the minimum weekly rest must be taken on a Sunday. The Directive<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>originally contained a sentence stating that the weekly rest period should, in principle, include Sunday. In its ruling in Case C-84/94<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, however, the Court of Justice annulled that sentence. It pointed out that the Working Time Directive was adopted as a health and safety directive, and held that the Council had acted outside its powers in including the provision on Sunday, since it had 'failed to explain why Sunday, as a weekly rest day, is more closely connected with the health and safety of workers than any other day of the week.'</p>
<p>This does not prevent the Member States from legislating on this point. In practice, the national legislation of many Member States<a href="#defann_51_5" name="refann_51_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> does provide for the weekly rest to be taken in principle on a Sunday, though exceptions from that principle may be permitted.</p>
<p>As regards retailing, as the honourable Member implies in his question, small independently owned shops may already open on Sundays. Thus to the extent that restrictions apply to Sunday trading in this sector they apply to supermarkets and larger stores only. Moreover, there are derogations offered to such stores notably when they are located in touristic areas. The Commission has no evidence to suggest that Sunday opening leads to the demise of small independent stores. Indeed it would refute the suggestion that the only chance for such stores to compete is to have access to Sunday opening when their larger competitors are closed since it would imply that small stores are fundamentally inefficient and therefore not in the consumer's interest which the Commission would wish to contest. The Commission will be reviewing this issue in its Communication on monitoring of the retail market that is due to be adopted in November 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission's views on prospects for the Eastern European countries and the Baltic States for the period 2009-2010 have been set out in its services' autumn forecast published on 3 November. The forecast is based on the assumption that the functioning of financial markets will resume only gradually in the coming months and that the negative effects of the crisis on the financial sector and on the broader economy will be persistent throughout the period 2009-2010.</p>
<p>Central and eastern European economies are obviously affected by the impact of global financial turmoil. However, the central European economies are on average expected to record more favourable growth rates than the EU-15 in 2009 and 2010, while the Baltic States are forecast to go through a sharp reversal of the high growth rates experienced in previous years. This is the result of a necessary correction - following a period of substantial overheating - which is being further amplified by the negative impact of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The boom phase in the Baltic States was associated with sizeable inflows of financing, both in terms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other forms of funding. A large part of this financing was channelled to the non-tradable sector. On the budgetary side, windfall revenue associated with the booming economy was largely directed towards higher expenditure, in a context where fiscal policy should, on the other hand, have been more restrictive, thereby also providing appropriate signals to market participants. Business and consumer confidence levels have now fallen to the lowest levels in a decade, while the authorities have little fiscal room to counter the adverse effects of the downturn.</p>
<p>The Commission has made a first contribution to the ongoing debate on how best to respond to the current crisis and its aftermath in the Communication 'From financial crisis to recovery: a European framework for action', issued 29 October. On 26 November the Commission will propose a more detailed EU recovery framework, under the umbrella of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. This framework will bring together a series of targeted short term initiatives designed to help counter adverse effects on the wider economy and adapting the medium to long term measures of the Lisbon strategy to take account of the crisis. On the basis of the framework, country-specific measures tailored to each country situation, will be proposed in December.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0877"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the economic impact of the possible presence of unapproved GMOs in feed imports.</p>
<p>For this reason the College instructed in May the services of the Commission to find a technical solution to the issue of low level presence of unauthorised GMOs.</p>
<p>In the period since the College discussion, the Commission services have invested in an intensive and constructive analysis of the situation. The aim was and still is very clear: finding the facts as well as an approach that would, at the same time, secure the sourcing of feed commodities and respect the zero-tolerance approach for unauthorised GMOs laid down in the EU legislation.</p>
<p>There are various technical and legal elements to consider before defining a technical measure able to meet these conditions. The Commission's services are to conclude their technical work which would allow the Commission to present a draft text.</p>
<p>In particular, experience has shown that the combined effect of asynchronous authorisations with diverging approaches to controls for the presence of unapproved GM events results in a climate of uncertainty for EU operators and thus in possible disruption of trade. A technical measure of harmonisation of controls could address the problem of traces of not yet approved GMOs, thus reducing the impact of asynchronous authorisations on feed import during the first phases of commercialisation of new GM events in Third Countries. It would not cover the possible contamination deriving from a wide commercial cultivation of a GM event not yet authorised in the EU.</p>
<p>Amongst the key factors is the difference in the duration of the GMO approval procedure between Third Countries and the EU, in combination with the lack of appropriate segregation mechanisms in exporting countries, and the global marketing strategies of the seed industry.</p>
<p>The efforts of the Commission to (quickly) process the authorisation of GM events (like the maize GA21 and the soybeans Liberty Link and Roundup Ready2) already approved in Third Countries in order to avoid trade disruption for the EU feed and livestock industry should also be recalled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, discussions with the European Food Safety Authority have already allowed efficiency gains in the duration of the authorisation procedure without compromising on the quality of the EFSA scientific assessment. The shortening of the preliminary phase of completeness check in the EFSA assessment is a good example. The future approval by a Commission Regulation of guidelines on the requirements for the scientific assessment of GM dossiers should further contribute to reducing the timeline for authorisation. This Regulation will precisely identify what is expected from the biotech applicants to prove that their products respect our high level standards of food safety and thus improve the quality of applications, thereby facilitating the assessment process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
