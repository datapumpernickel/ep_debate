<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are certainly keeping me busy today! But we now turn to an extremely grave matter. In this regard, I should like to give you the following information: in a few days" time, the negotiations on resolving the crisis in Kosovo will resume in France. At this stage I should like, on behalf of the presidency, to underline once again the European Union"s willingness to do all it can to bring the negotiation process begun in Rambouillet to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us would certainly have liked Rambouillet to have produced a more positive result. Unfortunately, an agreement was not signed, but nonetheless these negotiations were not in vain. They prepared the ground for both sides to give a written undertaking to continue this process, and that is an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Our particular thanks go to the co‐chairmen of the Conference, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and France, Mr Cook and Mr Védrine. I should also like to say how much I appreciated the tireless efforts made by the three leaders of the negotiations: the EU special envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch; the US special envoy, Christopher Hill; and the special envoy of the Russian Federation, Boris Mayorski.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only through the international community presenting a united front that it was possible to bring the belligerent parties to the negotiating table and to lay the foundations for a possible final peaceful settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the draft Rambouillet agreement achieves a fair balance between the interests of both sides. While respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it provides for substantial autonomy for Kosovo with a high degree of local self‐administration, legislative bodies and its own judiciary. Kosovo"s final status would then be determined three years later at an international conference.</p>
<p class="contents">An important matter, on which both parties still need to agree, is the military back‐up to be provided for civilian implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In their opening declaration at the Rambouillet talks, the Kosovar Albanians explicitly called for the rapid deployment of NATO troops, while the Belgrade side did at least say that it was prepared to discuss the scale and make‐up of an international presence to implement the agreement. That is a point on which a final agreement remains to be negotiated on 15 March. In the meantime, the moderate political movements of the Kosovar Albanians have stated that they are willing to sign the agreement. This is an encouraging sign and, above all, a warning sign to Belgrade not to stand in the way of a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, has just returned from a trip to Belgrade and Pristina, where, in his capacity as President‐in‐Office of the Council, he once again impressed on both sides the fact that they would be the first to suffer if the peace process begun in Rambouillet were to fail. The Kosovar Albanians would lose the opportunity for far‐reaching autonomy, safeguarded by international troops. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have to be prepared for increased international isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Mr Fischer reaffirmed the intention of the international community not to stand and watch if the belligerent parties refuse to cooperate. NATO"s threat is meant seriously and is still real, because this is about the people of Kosovo. They are the ones who are having to bear the burden of this conflict. Well over 200 000 refugees and displaced persons still do not dare to return home to their villages. The persistent local fighting and the Yugoslav army"s stepping‐up of training exercises in recent weeks have caused further waves of refugees into Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides have to show, in the interests of their people, that they are equal to the political responsibility resting on them. The international community is prepared to play its part. The European Union already signalled during the negotiations that it would be involved in implementing the agreement. This intention was confirmed by the General Affairs Council of 22 February 1999. The European Union will therefore take on a leading role. The Commission has said that it is prepared to host a donor conference at an early stage, so that the work of reconstruction can begin as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission"s initial assessment, the damage runs to around EUR 330 million. Houses which have been destroyed need to be repaired or rebuilt as swiftly as possible. Refugees and displaced persons must be able to return home quickly. Farmers need seed. All of this is a basic precondition for peaceful everyday life to resume in Kosovo and for the situation to stabilise and get back to normal. We know that the population will not be able to do this on its own and is dependent on our help. We are prepared to give it, provided that the leaders of the Kosovar Albanians and the leadership in Belgrade show sufficient courage and are sufficiently far‐sighted to accept the Contact Group"s proposals on 15 March.</p>
<p class="contents">In Rambouillet, a decisive step was taken towards reaching a peaceful settlement. I urge both sides to follow this road to the end on the basis of the compromises already reached, and to refrain from taking any measures which might put at risk what has been achieved so far. It is thanks to the international community"s determination and unity that the negotiations in Rambouillet have achieved some degree of success. The European Union has made a decisive contribution to this and it will continue – both at the forthcoming talks in Paris and in the possible implementation of the agreement – to play the role incumbent upon it, in order to maintain peace and stability on its south‐eastern border.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the President‐in‐Office, Mr Verheugen, has provided you with a complete summary of the present situation in Kosovo. There is no doubt that this is a crucial time and we hope that when the international community and the parties involved meet again on Monday in Paris, they will be able to sign an agreement, despite the news we have received of the recent clashes at the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also concerned at the recent news about the separation of men and women in the southern part of the region. As the President‐in‐Office already mentioned, Mr Fischer and my colleague Commissioner van den Broek visited Belgrade and Pristina on Monday, which is why I am standing in for the Commissioner today. Their aim was to put pressure on the parties to sign the Rambouillet agreement and arrange an international military presence to guarantee its application. The talks in Belgrade did not give rise to much optimism and the three delegations were warned that they should not underestimate the resolve of the international community. A meeting was also held in Pristina with the political leaders, who all expressed their support for the outcome of the Rambouillet Conference. The Commission hopes that the Kosovo Liberation Army will overcome its hesitation and sign the agreement. Some members of the KLA are perhaps suspicious of the fact that they will have to hand over their weapons when the agreement comes into force under international military supervision. But they must realise that it would be a grave mistake to delay or to reject the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the agreement, Kosovo"s autonomy must be established by promoting economic and social development in the region. The European Commission is naturally prepared to fulfill its obligations in this respect, and once the agreement has been signed, reconstruction will be our main priority. Measures have already been taken to assess the damage, and the results were analysed recently in Brussels with the international donor community. Although not all of Kosovo could be assessed, it is estimated that a minimum of EUR 350 million will be required for reconstruction work alone. As soon as the agreement is signed, the Commission will organise a meeting of donors with a view to raising the funds needed to cover the costs of reconstruction. The Commission itself will guarantee an adequate presence on the ground and it hopes to play a prominent and visible role in the reconstruction work. At the same time, the development of civil society in all its dimensions must be encouraged, and this is an objective to which the European Union hopes to contribute along with other international organisations such as the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore the Commission"s position on this important issue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I should like to fully endorse the picture presented and the views expressed by the presidency and the Commission on this matter. Our biggest problem is, of course, that for peace we need partners, but that we still only have two opponents who are hardly prepared to become real partners. It is also difficult to become a partner under pressure, but we have no alternative other than to exert this pressure on both the Serbian and the Kosovar‐Albanian sides.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Serbian side is concerned, and there is no need to waste words in passing<br />moral judgement on Milosevic and other Serb leaders, I just have one concern – and I do not know whether the presidency would like to comment on this – which is that the actions, in themselves perfectly understandable, of the High Representative Carlos Westendorp with regard to Republika Srpska, by being taken at this particular time, just a few days before the Conference reconvenes in Rambouillet, might harden the resolve of the Serbian side.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking here of the decision made in Brcko, but even more of the decisions on staffing concerning Poplasen, which ultimately also led to Dodic"s resignation, who is of course to some extent our ‘ally" on the Serbian side in Republika Srpska. That is a question I am asking myself. I hope that this has been well coordinated and well thought out.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Kosovar‐Albanian side is concerned, I should like once again to say loudly and clearly here that all of us who hold talks with liberation movements or resistance movements, whether it is the Kurds on the one hand or the Kosovar Albanians on the other, have a duty to insist that they adopt a peaceful, cooperative position, a position on the basis of which a compromise can be reached. I believe – as the Commissioner has also said – that some things have already started to happen: on the KLA side too, forces which are more willing to compromise have come to the fore, and I still say that if these resistance movements want the solidarity and support of the international community, then they too must be prepared to cooperate and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point which I should like to underline clearly once again, and which I would ask to be taken into account in the position we adopt at the talks in Rambouillet, is as follows: without military back‐up, the whole initiative does not make any sense, and it will be years – as we have of course also seen in Bosnia – before a real solution is reached here. Please, stand firm where the military back‐up for peace is concerned!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed Kosovo here four weeks ago, it was clear to those who know the facts that nothing tangible in terms of agreements would come out of Rambouillet. The fear that Milosevic is above all playing for time has, of course, proved to be well founded. The deadline"s being put back three times was also only to be expected. Milosevic knows our weaknesses, but he does not know how determined we are. This is now also true of the hardliners on the Albanian side. Despite Rambouillet and despite the agreement reached in October last year between Mr Holbrooke and Milosevic, Serb soldiers have, in the meantime, moved into Kosovo and are creating a gauntlet which has to be run to cross over into Macedonia and Albania. There are 4 500 new heavily armed soldiers on the Macedonian border and 1 500 on the Albanian border. This warlike activity is frightening the Albanians and of course putting them to flight, and we are standing by and watching, as is our wont. We are not doing anything; we are thinking about reconstruction, but I think that first we need to make sure that there are no refugees before we think about reconstruction and go grovelling in Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the inglorious Lord Owen – of whom we all still have painful memories from the war in Bosnia – puts in an appearance and makes the abstruse proposal actually to offer Milosevic compensation for Kosovo by separating Republika Srpska from the State of Bosnia, which is recognised under international law, and allowing him to annex it. As long as ideas of this kind lurk at the back of the mind of a good many negotiators, Milosevic will succeed in stalling us and keeping the source of the blaze, Kosovo, alight. He will continue to drive the Kosovar Albanians out; he is of course experienced in ethnic cleansing. And in the end there will simply be fewer Albanians in Kosovo, in whose minority rights no one will really be interested any more, still less in defending them.</p>
<p class="contents">That, then, is my realistic assessment of the situation and those are the reasons for my fears. But against my better judgement, I am still hoping for an agreement in Rambouillet and I have done all I can to influence the Albanians. Only it must be clear – as Mr Swoboda has already said – that there should be no agreement unless it includes military monitoring! Unless this is the case, any talk of reconstruction is likewise to no avail. I wish the negotiating parties, and above all the Europeans, who thank God are also sitting at the negotiating table, success with all my heart, because the implementation of the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia – and it has already been pointed out that this is, unfortunately, like trying to square the circle – would also be made easier if Milosevic were finally to consider his real duties as a Yugoslav politician and abandon his aim of a greater Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be better for everyone in the region, and in particular the Serbs, if Milosevic were at last forced, as indeed he should be, to answer for his war crimes in The Hague.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cars </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV) </span> Mr President, many people in Europe, not least in my own country, are opposed to the idea of too far‐reaching a process of Europeanisation. They are made uneasy by the prospect of national self‐esteem being replaced by a far stronger sense of European identity. The developments in the Balkans show just how wrong they are, and how important it is to ensure that the process of Europeanisation makes rapid progress in every European country, without exception.</p>
<p class="contents">We all possess our own national historical heritage. It helps us to retain our sense of identity in an ever‐expanding world, whether we be Bavarians or Germans, Gascons or Frenchmen, Smålanders or Swedes. In view of this we need a common European identity, based on a recognition of the freedom and equal worth of individuals – values that constitute Europe's most valuable contribution to the world community.</p>
<p class="contents">In our time, no area of Europe has had more ground to cover in this respect than the Balkan countries. They still retain the ethos of national self‐interest and intolerance which the European countries, thanks to a deeper level of cooperation, have managed to overcome, although the pace has sometimes been slow. It is both right and essential that Parliament and the EU as a whole should concentrate their efforts on reaching an agreement that will put an end to the bloodshed in Kosovo and pave the way for a lasting peace. As Liberals, we regard Rambouillet and the continuing negotiations as a step along that road. There is no call for an international military operation in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our commitment in the Balkans should go considerably further. We have to help the people to overcome their petty, narrow‐minded nationalism so that each race can see itself in a broader context than as exclusively Orthodox Serb in the case of the Serbs, or Albanian Muslim in the case of the Kosovans.</p>
<p class="contents">When the guns fall silent and the killing stops, then we will have to face the real challenge, namely to spread a sense of being European throughout the Balkan countries, in order to create a society characterised by tolerance and a recognition of the freedom and equal worth of individuals, so that in the future it will be possible for the people of the Balkans to be part of the wider European community.</p>

Firstly, it is our opinion that there can be no military solution to the problem in Kosovo. Secondly, because of their unilateral nature, the threats made by NATO, the USA and the European Union are simply helping to reinforce the most extreme elements and are making it more difficult to find a political solution. Thirdly, focusing attention on the acceptance of NATO troops by the new Yugoslavia underscores the priorities of NATO, which is pushing for military presence for its own geopolitical aims in the context of the new order of things. Fourthly, the solution that is going to be reached, leaving open the question of the independence of Kosovo, threatens to open up a Pandora"s box in the Balkan region and to embroil all the countries in that region. Finally, is it not perhaps hypocritical for us to speak about the Kosovar Albanians, who indeed need our support, while ignoring the fact that thousands of Kurdish refugees are facing expulsion in Turkey and we say nothing about this?</p>

We also support the presence of a peacekeeping force, should one be required, on condition that it complies with international law and has a mandate from the UN. However, it is clear that the really vital work will remain to be done once a peace treaty has been signed. In such a situation, a European civil peace corps, like the one decided on by Parliament on the basis of my report, could play a major role. There is also a need for a stability pact in the former Yugoslavia and south‐east Europe generally.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot help thinking of my own region, namely the Nordic countries, where during the last 200 years, in the wake of centuries of warfare, we have managed to find satisfactory ways of cooperating without damaging the sovereignty of the individual countries. During the past 200 years, some new Scandinavian states have come into existence, and in all probability there will be more in the future, just as has come about in the former Yugoslavia. The setting‐up of new states need not pose a threat to freedom, provided there are stable and close cooperation procedures in place.</p>

We continue to refuse to speak of the attackers and the attacked, placing the Kosovar Albanians and Mr Milosevic"s regime on the same footing and believing that they must reach a compromise. Yet we know very well that it is mainly Belgrade that is blocking progress. We know and must never forget that there have been thousands killed in Kosovo, that there are hundreds of thousands of refugees and that this tragedy was certainly not provoked by the so‐called Kosovar extremists, but was planned by Mr Milosevic, as has been established, both politically and legally, in reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that you will succeed in obtaining an agreement and that you will be able to implement it. But we also have serious doubts since we know that as long as that man is in Belgrade, there will be no peace for the Kosovars, nor any democracy for the Serbs. We will continue to be confronted with the threats of destabilisation, as we saw once again last week in Bosnia. Therefore, the structure you are building with so much skill, patience and imagination is a structure that is not founded on any real principle of democracy or the rule of law. It is a structure that ultimately simply serves to shore up this tyrant in Belgrade who has massacred in Bosnia and who has massacred in Kosovo, and who will continue to do so because his power rests on massacres, on the negation of democracy and on the negation of the rule of law. I have no illusions, but the Council must finally implement a common European policy and confront this problem of democracy in Belgrade and then clearly confront it in Kosovo too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank the President‐in‐Office of the Council for his statement. I have to say, however, that I cannot agree with Mrs Pack's negative view of what has been achieved so far. I believe there has been some considerable progress. But I recognise the point she is making that, until we get final agreement, we actually have nothing. Therefore the events of the next week or so are going to be crucial. We must have an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not as concerned as Mrs Pack and other speakers have been that there has been delay in the agreement. What we must try to get out of these negotiations is clearly an agreement that works and will be enforceable. The price for that is a few weeks' delay. After all that has gone on it is probably a price that is worth paying. But we have to keep to our principles here: firstly, we have to keep the contact group together and on board; we have to make sure there is full solidarity between EU Member States – any weakening by any one of the Member States will undermine the push for a final agreement; we have to recognise again that what we are talking about is autonomy for Kosovo while respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Also, we have to make it clear that we will not tolerate war crimes and other criminal activities and that we have the clear intention of bringing criminals to book once there is an agreement. We are not prepared to let people get away with some of the activities they have got away with in the past. We still very much need to push that message home in relation to Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, in disagreement with at least one speaker, that I do not believe this agreement will work without a military presence. We all have to recognise the sensitivity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to having foreign troops in its territory but, nonetheless, it will not work without a military presence. But we must not commit a single fighting man until we are sure we have a peace agreement. We must not endanger the lives of European or American troops without that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the European Community must be prepared to spend not a single penny on reconstruction until we are sure we have an agreement. When we are clear that we have agreement then we should push very hard to reconstruct Kosovo and, in particular, deal with the question of refugees and displaced persons. If we really want peace then the European Union has to be very proactive once there is agreement. But we have to have an agreement first.</p>

The real problem is Mr Milosevic, just as the problem in Iraq is Saddam Hussein. To make peace, you need two people: to wage war, one is sufficient. We should not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, that means two things: firstly, we need credibility on our side, and we need to demonstrate our credibility when we talk about democracy. In an international context, democracy is nothing other than peoples" right to self‐determination, which is something people love to talk about, but which, once they have won a war, they quickly forget. This has time and again proved to be a curse for humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should not labour under any illusions, and here I agree with Mr Titley: without a military presence, there will be no peace here. It is absolutely essential. It should not be prolonged indefinitely, but it must be there, it must be perceptible, and it must actually ensure that the commitments or promises signed up to are kept. We certainly do not want to shut out the Serbian people; Serbs are also Europeans and some day they too will have a right to belong to Europe, but that can only be the case under a genuinely civilised regime, and not under a totalitarian dictatorship, which is what Milosevic"s system is.</p>

It has come to be a kind of political cliff‐hanger, and in a few days" time we shall see the start of a new phase in the talks process. What will be the follow‐up to the conclusions of Rambouillet? That is the question which is naturally exercising people"s minds both here and elsewhere. The international clock is running, and which of the two parties will be the first to accept the Rambouillet conclusions? What steps will be taken against those who do not accept them? These are the most pressing questions at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovo Albanians appear to be close to accepting the conclusions, but Milosevic is still wrestling with the question of his sovereignty. Can he agree to having military forces in his Federal Republic? The Serbian presence in Kosovo has intensified, and that too is cause for concern. What is Milosevic"s aim here? These are questions which will have to be answered in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope is simply that the parties will accept the conclusions of Rambouillet. They contain the germ of a solution for the longer term, even though no one will be happy with every aspect of them. But it will not hurt anyone in the region to learn how to compromise. That has always been my group"s line in this conflict too. Unilateral solutions lead to unilateral consequences, so they are not real solutions. But if Rambouillet is step A, then step B has to be an international military presence. And that certainly has to be a longer‐term military presence. How are we to organise that? As a question, that is at least as interesting as the question of when Rambouillet will be concluded. What role will the European Union play in that?</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have to seize the opportunity to debate how the Amsterdam Treaty is to be implemented and how the European Union can play a part in this kind of area in future. That will doubtless require unanimity within the EU. And I hope unanimity will be maintained in the immediate future, because without it we shall not be able to play a meaningful role here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be prepared to enforce the Rambouillet agreement by military force if necessary, if the Serbs persist in rejecting it. But ultimately a political solution must of course be preferably to a military one.</p>

Regrettably the first signs do not augur well, not only because of the troops being deployed around Kosovo by the Serbian Government, but also because of an extremely disquieting episode, namely the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of certain KLA representatives, three of whom have been negotiators at Rambouillet. Clearly we cannot turn up with mere aspirations, but must have a proper policy demanding that the treaty be signed and not postponed indefinitely. I disagree with Mr Titley, who believes that an agreement must be reached, even if it takes time: more time means more deaths and a further deterioration in the situation. The deal must therefore be clinched immediately, and it must be a tough one with peace as its goal.</p>
<p class="contents">One question which must be addressed is the need for the members of the contact group to speak with a single voice, and for there to be close cooperation between the European Union and the USA so as to maintain a united front. We must not fall out of step, because Milosevic exploits any gaps to pursue his policy of procrastination in an effort to avoid the day of reckoning when harsh conclusions will be reached. What is also needed here is a broader view of the Balkan problem. The signing of an agreement cannot be the end of the matter: a more general plan is now needed to bring peace throughout the Balkans. A conference should be convened to this end, and I believe that the Council, under the German Presidency, could begin working in this direction.</p>

We have nothing better! Nevertheless, we are forced to realise that it has not been possible to square the circle. Milosevic is still refusing to allow a military intervention force in Kosovo, and the KLA is refusing to disarm and be satisfied with autonomy. The Kosovars" weakness, their political fragmentation, is Milosevic"s strength. You cannot help thinking that both sides have simply used the break in the negotiations to arm themselves for the forthcoming spring offensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The flurry of political activity, on the part of both the European presidency and the United States, has done nothing to change this. Once again, as has been the case so often before in the Balkans, this situation is exposing the weaknesses of the so‐called international community. NATO is, admittedly, still ready to give the order to go into action, but the credibility of the only western military alliance to remain intact has suffered in Kosovo, not only because of the jealousy which keeps on surfacing between the United States and France, but also, and above all, because of the European partners" hesitation to become involved in a cost‐intensive military operation which might last for years. We can only continue to note this lack of political will with regret, and call on the Europeans finally to make up their minds about what we call the common foreign and security policy!</p>

I have to say, however, that reaching an agreement comes first and in this I agree with Mr Titley. We must reach an agreement which will guarantee the integrity of the borders in the Balkans, a request that has been put forward by all the Balkan countries: Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Romania. Only if a specific agreement can be reached on how to solve the problem of the autonomy of the region will we be able to say that military presence will have a positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, this region is full of memories. Today in Greece we have French, English, German and Spanish people who are visiting the cemeteries of English, French, German, Bulgarian and Serb people who died in the First World War. I would therefore like to stress the need to reach an agreement which, as I said, must guarantee current borders. When this agreement has been reached, the armed forces which are currently massing in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be able to play a more constructive role.</p>
<p class="contents">In European terms, Kosovo is not another Iraq. While we welcome the American presence in the region, nevertheless this issue is essentially a European Union issue, which is why we need solidarity among all Member States of the European Union in dealing with it.</p>
