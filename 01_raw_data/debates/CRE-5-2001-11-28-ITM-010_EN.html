<p class="contents">When one or two months ago the Commission presented its proposal for the first time, there was some doubt. This doubt had nothing to do with the appreciation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the European Agency for Reconstruction. Indeed, this Agency has had very positive feedback right from the outset. This positive assessment was confirmed recently by a very complimentary remark by the Court of Auditors about the prompt and effective way in which the Agency has carried out its work to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initial doubts were, therefore, quite unrelated to the Agency, but stemmed from the fact that the Commission itself appeared unsure as to which direction to take with regard to assistance in the Balkans. Should it run its entire operation via the Agency for Reconstruction, first in Yugoslavia, subsequently in Macedonia and soon, perhaps, in Albania and Croatia, or should the Commission adhere to its original policy to devolve its powers to the delegations in the various countries?</p>
<p class="contents">We have, meanwhile, had the opportunity of talking to the Commissioner about this. He promised that the Commission will soon, early next year, come up with an opinion about the strategy to be pursued with regard to assistance in the Balkans and that it will specify more clearly the role of the Agency for Reconstruction and the role which the devolved delegations must play. We await this report with interest. At the moment, and this removes the last lingering doubt, there is no alternative but to accord the Agency an important role if we want to grant assistance in Macedonia promptly and efficiently. I believe that, as far as this aspect is concerned, we are in complete agreement with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so important to grant aid in Macedonia so quickly now and to do this, therefore, via the Agency? I have pointed out the great significance of the developments in Macedonia for the European Union many times, both earlier in this debate and at other occasions, notably after 11 September. Macedonia’s importance is many times greater than that of a relatively small country in the Balkans. Indeed, it is the first time that the European Union has managed, in talking with one voice, to do a reasonable job in the Balkans, in Macedonia, something which we would have liked to have seen a long time ago. It is the greatest success story of European foreign policy so far. Talk with one voice and do what you do best: that is, after all, what the Commission and the European Union have been doing to date in Macedonia. There have been talks and consultations, compromises have been reached, financial aid pledged and limited military aid promised. In my view, that is the best that the European Union has to offer at the moment, and it is important for this effort, namely having prevented a civil war from breaking out a few months ago, to be followed up by sufficient financial aid and sufficient reconstruction equipment. Hence, a positive opinion, from Parliament too, about involving the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">If the situation changes for the worse in Macedonia, then I fear that that will rub off in the Balkans as a whole. Hence, once again, my urgent plea for involving the Agency, but also for mapping out a sound strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well-known fact – fellow MEPs, Swoboda and Pack, and the Commissioner, himself, have visited the region many times – that tension in Macedonia is currently very high. Under pressure from the European Parliament, the European Union and many international bodies, the Macedonian Parliament has, at long last, ratified the constitution. That has led, and is still leading, to major tension. Europe can do a great deal to clear that tension, and one of the ways is to translate words into deeds swiftly. That is where the Agency comes in.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, prompt aid in Macedonia is needed, both materially and politically. At the moment, we need the Agency there for reconstruction. I would urge the Commission to clarify its strategy in the Balkans soon, and also to specify the role which the Agency has to play and the role which other sections of the Commission will need to play in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I shall not need all this time.</p>
<p class="contents">It now finally looks as if developments in the Balkans are heading in the right direction and in a more stable way. We finally have something resembling peace, albeit under armed supervision, with continued violence between ethnic groups and still a long way to go before there is peaceful co-existence. It has been possible to successfully implement the disarmament of the armed groups in Macedonia, especially following important efforts by the EU. We can therefore feel a certain optimism, even though history has all too often shown us that peace is fragile, especially in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy, too, is making progress. Last autumn, the Milosevic dictatorship collapsed through the Yugoslav people’s decisive action. In Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, albeit with a number of problems in the last case, the democratic powers have made progress. Last week’s election in Kosovo was conducted impeccably. It felt like a privilege to be present at this historic event as an observer from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot remains to be done, however. There is a great need for purely physical reconstruction, but also for the development of the economy and infrastructure that were allowed to fall into decay during the nineties. The most important thing of all is, perhaps, to bring about a genuine process of reconciliation through which the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in large parts of these countries can be got to grips with and solutions found to the serious outstanding problems involving refugees and displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that those of us in the Committee on Budgets have adopted three reports on temporarily extended, and also, in certain cases, increased, macro-financial assistance to Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a word about Macedonia. In November 1999, the Council decided to give Macedonia macro-financial assistance to the tune of EUR 80 million, part of it in the form of a loan, together with a contribution of up to EUR 30 million. The decision was taken against the background of the war in Kosovo because this crisis gave rise to large costs in Macedonia, to which hundreds of thousands of people fled. The aim has been to facilitate the implementation of structural reforms and to offset the consequences of the economic disruption caused by the Kosovo conflict. The aid, of course, has conditions attached to it, mainly to the effect that the programme of economic and public administration reforms continue and that the agreements reached in Ohrid earlier this autumn be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, Macedonia has suffered as a result of this internal armed conflict. The conflict has, of course, also given rise to further problems and caused delays in making the assistance available. It has only been possible to pay out a portion of it within the relevant time-frame. That is why we now want to extend the legal basis for these forms of assistance. That is something we have no problems with at all. However, the Commission also proposes an increased financial contribution because there are beginning to be problems with Macedonia, where developments have otherwise been positive. The problems have been exacerbated by the conflict. That is why the Commission is now proposing increasing the contribution by EUR 18 million. Against this political background, the Committee on Budgets believes the Commission’s proposal to be well considered. Nonetheless, we have tabled a number of amendments in order to emphasise that this aid must be administered by the Commission, but in close consultation with <span class="italic">both</span> the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The background to this is that we see it as important to monitor not only the purely financial management of the assistance but also more political aspects with a view, for example, to making sure that no part of the assistance is used to equip the Macedonian army.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also emphasise that this type of aid, that is to say, contributions in combination with a long-term ‘soft’ loan, must be seen as exceptional and not allowed to constitute the norm for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We then have the matter of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In May 1999, we decided to provide the assistance in question, comprising a loan of EUR 20 million and contributions of up to EUR 40 million. This was, of course, also done to ease the economic situation and to support reconstruction in Bosnia and was obviously conditional upon the economy and the institutions of democracy continuing to be reformed. We have had a number of problems with implementation, as a result of which assistance amounting to EUR 15 million remains to be paid out. If we are to be able to make this available, we need, then, to extend the legal basis. In this assessment, we must also take account of the fact that the elections held in Bosnia in November 2000 led to everything’s having taken an extremely long time, what with negotiations and the High Representative’s having had to intervene etc. All this has delayed both the reforms and the legislative work and, thus, also delayed our making the aid available.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth has not been particularly good. These forms of assistance are, therefore, genuinely needed, which is why those of us in the Committee on Budgets support the Commission’s proposal to modify this Council regulation so that we <span class="italic">can</span> extend the period up to the end of 2002. When it comes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the same conditions must, nonetheless, apply in this case, as apply in the case of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, something about the third matter, Yugoslavia. We decided, as late as this year, to provide this macro-financial assistance of up to EUR 300 million in the form, in this case too, both of loans and of contributions. The primary aim is, of course, to provide financial, social and political support for a stable Yugoslavia, but it is also, and this is something I want to emphasise, to promote Yugoslavia’s role as a stabilising factor throughout the region. This year, it has emerged that the economic situation has, perhaps, been a little more strained than we had previously believed. In particular, the privatisation process has taken longer, which has also led to the State budget’s losing income from the privatisation. We also know it has been a tough process finding a solution to the problem of Yugoslavia’s relationship with the World Bank, the IMF etc.</p>
<p class="contents">If no money is provided, there is obviously a great risk of the economic situation’s deteriorating further. We should, therefore, bear in mind that Yugoslavia now already has major debts amounting to more than 140 per cent of GDP. That is why the Commission wants these new amounts, constituting an increase of EUR 45 million, to be in the form of contributions. The Committee on Budgets says OK, but emphasises that these must, nonetheless, be seen as part of the EU’s multiannual programme and that they constitute exceptional assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also arranged for the assistance to be paid out, <span class="italic">provided</span> that Yugoslavia continues to develop into a constitutional state and that the country continues to cooperate closely with the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these three cases, we also believe that, in order to produce new resources during the current budget year, ordinary budget procedure must be followed. This can only be done by means of a parallel process involving a transfer of funds from other budget items, something which requires a decision on the part of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, even before the last part-session in Strasbourg, the Commission wanted these matters to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. I said at that time that, in my view, there were nonetheless two matters that needed to be cleared up first. So that we, too, could see where the funds were to be taken from, we wanted, first of all, to see the Commission’s practical proposals for transferring funds in such a way as to produce the necessary EUR 45 or 18 million. These proposals for transferring funds are now on the table and have been discussed in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wanted to sort out the conciliation with the Council concerning next year’s budget so as to be able to guarantee that this aid can be combined with a continued high level of other aid for the Western Balkans and for reconstruction etc. We have now reached an agreement with the Council whereby this increased macro-financial assistance is to be seen as front loading for next year’s budget appropriation. At the same time, we jointly accept the Commission’s preliminary draft budget for the Balkans, something which I also hope will be the result of the second budget reading during the next part-session in Strasbourg. Against that background, we therefore support these three proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, finally, just to say a few words about my and the Committee on Budgets’ opinion on Mr Lagendijk’s report on the European Agency for Reconstruction. I have, myself, on quite a few occasions had the opportunity to see the Agency’s work at first hand, and I view it as a model of efficiency, as does Mr Lagendijk too. Moreover, this view is also confirmed by the Court of Auditors’ report. I believe there are a number of specific reasons for this success. Among these are the fact that, in accordance with Parliament’s demands, a more decentralised model for decision-making and the employment of EU aid has been implemented and that it has been possible to avoid the unwieldy and duplicated decision-making that we formerly had under the traditional committee system.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these excellent results from the Agency, the Committee on Budgets nonetheless wishes, in its amendments, to emphasise the importance of correct budget principles for distinguishing between administrative and operational expenditure with a view, for example, to our being able to make a proper, skilled assessment of the Agency’s activities. Moreover, we wish to introduce a reference to Article 274 of the Treaty, in order to emphasise clearly that this is aid which the Commission and <span class="italic">not</span>, in the first place, the Member States have the responsibility for implementing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Lagendijk has produced a very good report. I would also like to thank Mr Färm sincerely and on behalf of my group, of which I seem to be the only representative here today, thank them both and in general terms agree with everything they have said. I would also like to highlight a couple of things. I think this rapid reaction facility, this way of getting money to crisis regions quickly, efficiently and without bureaucracy, really is a good instrument. In Yugoslavia in particular, as the Commissioner has seen, they were grateful for this really quick and efficient assistance that was only possible because we had this instrument and did not have to use the usual longwinded procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it really must be extended to Macedonia, because something simply must be done to help the difficult political processes. The process is far from being completed. Laws need to be implemented so that the Albanian citizens can see that they really have gained something from these constitutional changes. The region’s Macedonian inhabitants must see that if they behave as is expected in democracies, they will also be rewarded with an improvement in their everyday lives. We agree to everything, we also agree to the reservations Mr Färm has mentioned. But I think the Commission knows all this very well and I am sure it respects it.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back again to the establishment of the agency in Macedonia. In view of the pathetic results of implementation and of spending the money earmarked for this country since 1996, I am of the opinion that it is high time we sought to remedy the situation. Of course, the Macedonian government lacked the will, and we who were down there know they were simply not in a position to do anything. Whether they were unable or unwilling I would not like to say now, but there was a lack of will on the part of the government, and, in the end, the delegation on the spot was unable to give the government the help it needed. The necessary technical assistance that the Commission should have given to this government was lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is therefore good that the Commissioner has now thought about measures that can be taken to speed things up. It will be good for the agency, which is doing excellent work in Kosovo – I expect we shall see that in Belgrade next weekend. We want it to be possible for them finally to do what the Macedonians are all waiting for and I have nothing against it being used.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, my problem is that there is so much tinkering around going on now. Now it is being done in Macedonia. I do not know when you will be so effective again next time. I would very much like to see a structure for this work in the region, and I would like to hear from you this evening whether you are willing or able to produce a scheme that will either, deconcentrate the delegations and enable them to do this work, or that you intend to deploy such agencies in the whole region. I believe you owe us an answer on that this evening and I hope that this evening you will tell us how soon you, in the Commission, believe you can lay such a scheme before us. On this condition, I am prepared to give you my unreserved best wishes for setting up this agency because we have all had excellent experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to criticise the delegation on the ground here. The delegation on the ground was not able to do what we expected of it because it was not deconcentrated, whatever that means, and it could not give the technical assistance. In that regard, I really am looking for a longer term scheme from you so that all the countries down there can feel they are being treated, more or less, equally and I think that is also important if we are to avoid creating rivalries between them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lagendijk has already indicated that the situation in the Balkans today is quite different from that six months or a year ago, especially if we think of the elections in Kosovo and the settlement in Macedonia. But that must not mislead us into saying everything has been done, the matter has been dealt with, we can just hang around and everything will turn out well. I also think the step the Commission proposes is correct and justified. But, Commissioner, we have already said, if it is really so and I believe it is, that there are serious differences between the work of the agency and the work of the delegations, and somewhere in between them, as a sort of happy medium, the decentralised delegations, then we must draw general conclusions from that, not because, in the one case, they are good people and, in the other, bad people. It must surely also have something to do with the structure of the decision-making processes. In this respect I am sure you will not be able to give us an answer today.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask you, however, one more thing, namely that, when restructuring the Commission’s work and policy in the Balkans; you will really use, to the full, the imagination that I am sure you, Commissioner, and many of your colleagues possess. For my part, I believe that the agency, which is not only a reconstruction agency but already a development agency, ought to play a greater part over all. I admit it can also be done jointly with delegations that are given additional tasks to do with decentralisation. But I do think that early next year, at the start of next year, we ought to suggest what the Commission’s assistance, support and development structure for the Balkans should look like for the next ten years, for it will take, at least, ten years to achieve the take off we all want for the Balkans and that we need for peace and stability in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am extremely grateful for the contribution which honourable Members have made to what has been a pretty successful development of Europe's strategy in the Balkans and I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can just re-establish the context in which we are having this debate. Honourable Members know that Macedonia was the first country with which we negotiated a stabilisation and association agreement. While we were negotiating that agreement, during each of my visits to FYROM – and I have visited Skopje probably more than any other capital city in the world in the last couple of years – we were regularly on the receiving end of grumbles about the lack of speed of our delivery of development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">When the crisis came this year, we worked very hard and I pay a particular vote of gratitude to the work of my colleague, Javier Solana. We worked extremely hard to try to get FYROM back on the rails. We were delighted by the Lake Ohrid Agreement and said straightaway that we would do everything we could to help the implementation of the framework agreement in Lake Ohrid.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern, as I have explained to honourable Members, was that unless we made a special effort, we would not deliver that assistance quickly enough. I would have very much liked to have gone through the process of deconcentration rather more rapidly to FYROM and delivered our assistance in a conventional way, but that was to run a risk. The most certain way in which we could deliver the assistance was by extending the work of the Reconstruction Agency and that is why we are all here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some honourable Members were understandably a little confused about our management strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, with which we are all much wiser, it would perhaps have been sensible if I had consulted honourable Members earlier. But I hope that we have managed to convince honourable Members that there was no intention on our part to downgrade our relationship with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I saw President Trikovsky earlier this week. He was en route to a prayer breakfast – I am afraid I was not – and I think that we have managed to convince him and the authorities in Skopje now that we are just trying to deliver assistance as rapidly as possible and we have already been delivering assistance in the sectors electricity and housing, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that honourable Members should think that there is some confusion in our management strategy for the whole region, But I do not feel that I am being inconsistent in arguing, on the one hand, that we have to work through Europe Aid, through deconcentration, which has now begun and which we must now push as rapidly as possible, while on the other hand, saying there may be odd occasions, particularly crises, which require different sort of arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">We are considering for example, at the moment how to deal with the situation in Afghanistan – whether we should put a task force into Afghanistan in order to get quick-acting projects going as soon as possible. So I do not think that it is inconsistent to press ahead with the reform of Europe Aid, while at the same time thinking that from time to time other arrangements are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can just remind honourable Members that we pledged EUR 30 million to the implementation of the framework agreement and that we have also been disbursing EUR 12.5 million under the rapid reaction mechanism. We have committed about EUR 5 million through ECHO to humanitarian relief and we have got a regular CARDS programme of EUR 42 million for this year for FYROM. All that work, except the ECHO dimension, will be put through the Agency over the next couple of months.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the next event on the horizon will be the donors conference, which we will try to organise with the World Bank. There are a number of conditions, as honourable Members will know. We were first of all insisting on the implementation of the framework agreement on the passage of amendments to the Constitution through the Parliament in Skopje. We also wanted a law on local government passed, because frankly if it is not, the United States is unlikely to come to a donors conference. It is absolutely crucial, as my colleague Commissioner Solbes would assure you, if we are to provide macro-financial assistance at a donors conference, that there must be an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Macro-financial assistance is never given unless there is such an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">President Trikovsky assured me this week that an agreement with the IMF is now on the cards and I think the relevant meeting in Washington is at the beginning of December. I hope therefore that on the back of the passage of the legislation, which I have referred to, the constitutional amendments and the recommendation of an agreement to the board of the IMF, we can hold a successful donors conference. If it is agreeable to all the parties, and to FYROM, we will do it before Christmas, but at the moment when it looks as though it is likely to be most successful. What I do not want to do is to set a date for a second time and have to postpone it, because that would be calamitous.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to honourable Members for the fast delivery of their opinion on what we are proposing. I am sorry that I cannot express my gratitude by accepting all the amendments which have been put down. Characteristically, I am not able to do that. Some of the amendments, for example the references to the provisional nature of what we are doing, are of no real legal value. Others, I am advised, are not really suitable for inclusion in a legal decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I want however to respond slightly differently to two of the arguments which have been put and which you will understand. First of all, I want to assure the Parliament that it would of course be consulted if there were any question of extending the Agency to other countries. If we were to propose that, we would of course consult the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, honourable Members, and this is a point that Mr Swoboda has made very eloquently, are concerned about the integrity of the management of what we are doing in Southeast Europe. They are concerned about the coherence of what we are doing in Southeast Europe and understandably press us to set out our strategy for the management of community assistance for the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to do that. I just beg Parliament not to press me to do it by 31 January. I will tell the Parliament why. We have a good team of people working on the Balkans in the Commission. They spend three-quarters of their time in meetings in the Council, in consultative task forces and in drafting reports; we are in the middle of drafting a report for the Council, which of course the Parliament will see, on the overall progress of the stabilisation and association process. I do not want to make unreasonable demands on them, but I can assure Parliament that, as early next year as I can manage it, I will come to Parliament to try to set out the sort of strategy which I think honourable Members are entitled to ask for and which we should be pleased to give. It is very important that Parliament should make sure from time to time that we actually know what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been in this job for just over two years and what I am going to say does not suggest that all that has happened is because there has been a new Commission – I am not suggesting that at all. But we have seen, first of all, a transformation in the region with the latest admirable events, as the honourable gentleman said: the elections in Kosovo and the developments in FYROM. We know that every time we take a couple of steps forward, something will happen which pushes us back again, but I think that from Croatia to Serbia, to Macedonia and Albania, we are heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a coherent strategy and we have made a remarkable amount of progress. We have made that progress because we have worked together in a way which has extended stability to the region and underpinned those who are prepared bravely to argue and work for economic and political reform.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the stabilising and association process is the prospect of potential membership of the European Union. That has been the most formidable element in bringing greater peace and stability to Southeast Europe. We must make sure that the huge amount of political and financial investment that we have made in the last couple of years continues to pay off in steady progress and development. That will of course be more likely if we are able to continue to work with Members of the Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, Mr Farm has made it quite clear that we are dealing with two distinct issues. These are firstly, increasing the amount of aid, and secondly, extending the period in which it is granted.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, we have disbursed EUR 30 million. This is partly due to delays in reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the economic programme. It is, indeed, the case that the conditions laid down pertaining to the constitutional changes now under way, and the much-needed support we are giving to economic stabilisation and the reform process mean that the International Monetary Fund’s cooperation is required. According to our information, the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will soon have in place an economic framework with associated follow-up. This would act as a link with a support programme sponsored by the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic situation remains extremely precarious. The International Monetary Fund has therefore informed us of the short-term financial requirements, and of the need for increased contributions by the various donors to cover the foreign financing deficit for the years 2001 and 2002. This is the main reason for our decision to increase our additional contribution to Macedonia by EUR 18 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are currently implementing aid. EUR 60 million is committed, of which 40 million is grants and 20 million is loans. The first two tranches have already been disbursed, one at the end of 1999 and the other at the end of 2000. Progress is being achieved in the areas of stabilisation and economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We have yet to disburse the final tranche of EUR 15 million. The conditions of disbursement are close to being met. A Commission mission charged with assessing progress achieved is in Sarajevo this week. Speaking more generally, it is fair to say that the new government formed after the elections does, on occasion, take some time to carry through reform processes. It is currently negotiating a new programme with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Farm also mentioned the need to extend the period agreed on, since that initially planned for implementation of contributions has expired.</p>
<p class="contents">From another perspective, the rapporteur also referred to the need to adjust financial or macro-financial aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The current EUR 300 million, of which 225 is loans and 75 is grants is proving insufficient. EUR 260 million has already been disbursed and the Commission is currently preparing to meet with the Yugoslav authorities again in the near future. We hope it will then be possible for the second tranche to be disbursed, providing the conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information received from the International Monetary Fund, however, it is clear that additional external financing will be required to eliminate the further financing deficit of EUR 150 million. This is why we are proposing to increase the grant element by EUR 45 million to a maximum grant level of EUR 120 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I must commend Mr Farm on his devotion to this issue and on the speed and urgency with which he has dealt with it. Thanks are also due to Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and to Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for their support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to classify the amendments tabled into groups. The amendments concerning political conditionality, the financial Regulation and the multiannual financial framework are acceptable, in principle. In some specific cases, however, they do present certain difficulties with regard to presentation or consistency. To take the reference CARDS in connection with multiannual assistance as an example of consistency, we have stated quite clearly on a number of occasions in plenary that CARDS has nothing to do with macro-financial assistance. The two elements are quite separate and I think the processes for using them correctly, in cases that might arise, should remain distinct.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not favourably inclined, either, to the comment that this assistance is exceptional and will not set a precedent for the future. That is certainly the case. Nonetheless, the same is true of all macro-financial assistance. We do not, therefore, feel that it makes much sense to debate that today.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we believe that it makes much sense to include elements involving additional delays in the whole process of making this assistance available. In this connection, whilst keeping Parliament duly informed, it would be wise to give more thought to the role of the Assistance Committee, which is quite a different body.</p>
<p class="contents">More detailed information on all these issues can be made available later. I simply wished to give some indication as to our initial position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
