Accurate monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions is vital to give us an overview of how effective EU policies are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and what more needs to be done to meet our Kyoto targets. This decision is an important further step in implementing the Kyoto Protocol and in ensuring that the Community delivers on all its commitments under the Protocol. Let me extend my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and his colleagues in the European Parliament, who have worked hard to enable a first reading agreement to be reached on this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Reaching agreement at first reading stage will enable this decision to enter into force quickly and be implemented by the Member States and would be a further concrete demonstration of the Community's commitment to addressing the problems of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, I warmly encourage Members of the European Parliament to support this possible deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, it is the most significant global issue in the area of environmental sustainability and is having disastrous effects not only on the climate but on ecosystems and plant and animal species too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union took up the challenge in May 2002, with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, thus demonstrating that the combating of climate change is one of its strategic priorities. In the decision ratifying the Protocol, the Member States agreed to fulfil their obligations under the Protocol jointly. In order to ensure that the Community as a whole succeeds in complying with the international legally binding commitments, they have agreed different emission reduction and limitation targets for each Member State. The Member States are therefore still responsible for reporting the data on annual emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a decision on which we are about to vote therefore establishes the necessary framework for ensuring the Community and its Member States meet the requirements on emissions reporting and accounting through an improvement of the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures adopted and on emissions and removals of all greenhouse gases, including methodological aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the structure of the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Convention guidelines, different reporting requirements are to be addressed by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting obligations. In addition, there are two provisions that are central to compliance with the commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. These are the implementation and the periodical update of national programmes for limiting or reducing gas emissions and the transparent monitoring of actual and projected emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow’s vote will oblige the Member States to calculate and send the Commission data on actual and estimated gas emissions by 15 January each year, so that the actual progress made can be assessed and the Community can draw up annual reports in accordance with its international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The few amendments your rapporteur has made to the proposed legislation are aimed at rendering the mechanism even more binding and effective, especially in the light of the latest, barely encouraging, data that show an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union for the second year running. As Mrs Wallström said, regarding the proposed amendments – 18, to be precise – in the informal negotiations which took place with the Council and the Commission after the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had given its opinion, an agreement was reached which incorporated the essence of our amendments, including the amendments with the greatest political significance such as those concerning the necessarily and mandatorily supplementary nature of the use of flexible mechanisms with regard to the internal action plans which each Member State is to introduce and pursue in order to achieve its own greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in tomorrow’s vote in the Chamber, we will be tabling a package of amendments on which agreement has been reached. I hope that Parliament will genuinely give fresh impetus to the measure, allowing the Member States to bring themselves into line with these rules quickly. I believe that it will also be a clear political signal with a view to a major event, next December in Milan, when we hope that more of the international community will ratify the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The heatwave, which affected us severely this summer, is a reminder of how serious the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is. We urgently need to find sustainable solutions to this problem. Clearly the European Union has to comply with the Kyoto objectives and above all contribute to ensuring sustainable development for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a decision, to be put to the vote during this part-session, is an important piece in the European Union's regulatory jigsaw on greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from the environmental aspect, we have to bear in mind that governments and industry are the main players here. The text in question makes it possible to put in place an efficient and reliable emissions calculation and projection system, an essential precondition for producing an evaluation of the situation in Europe that can be passed up to international level.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the information is still incomplete or inaccurate. As far as current Member States are concerned, too much information is still lacking, mainly on carbon sinks. The combination of environmental concerns, economic interests and governmental reluctance makes this a complex task, but we have been relatively successful in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would draw Members' attention to a specific point, the flexibility prescribed by the Kyoto Protocol for determining the reference year for monitoring certain gases. We should distance ourselves from the Commission's proposal of 1990 as the sole reference year and stick to the Protocol, while waiting to see what amendments might be made, as has just been said. That apart, I would strongly encourage Members to vote in favour of this text, which provides a reasonable legal framework and an appropriate timetable, combining flexibility and efficacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that we can hopefully conclude the debate on the directive at first reading shows that the European Union wants to work seriously to slow down climate change. There has been excellent cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I believe Mr Sacconi’s personal input has been important in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto Protocol lays down the obligations of the Parties to report on emissions. The decision on reporting in the EU, which goes back 10 years, has been an important basis for allowing us to reliably verify any negative trend with regard to emissions and create a framework to reverse that trend. It does not, however, adequately meet the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. In terms of accuracy and the way it is divided up, current reporting practice does not correspond, for example, to the way it should be divided up according to category of activity under the directive on emissions trading, which was adopted by the EU in the summer. Furthermore, there have been major omissions in the work of Member States and information that has either not been submitted or is inadequate has had to be supplemented by making the necessary calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">With the text now to be adopted the quality and accuracy of reporting will improve significantly. At the same time the intention is to rationalise how frequently information is submitted by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the so-called compromise package Parliament’s rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the Council have agreed between themselves that Member States must establish national inventory systems as soon as possible, and in any case no later than the end of 2005, for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by source. Compliance with the Kyoto agreements – both the setting of absolute targets and monitoring their achievement – obviously depends very much on how the inventory system is brought into operation. It is, of course, regrettable that there are not any guarantees of it being in operation when the first allocation with regard to emissions trading is made in the Member States. It will be important to adopt the grand total of 48 amendments contained in the compromise package in tomorrow’s vote so that the Member States can start to prepare for national implementation without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish in this connection to express one small hope. Under the Kyoto Protocol emissions in the first Kyoto commitment period will be examined on the basis of a five-year average. I would hope that the Community, for example the European Environment Agency, will also start to publish trends in emissions on the basis of a five-year average. That way we would eliminate, for example, differentials resulting from annual fluctuations in temperatures and rainfall when assessing how far the Community and the Member States are from the target. Present practice gives cause for unwarranted optimism and unwarranted pessimism, which can be hard to understand for the public at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore fully support the compromise proposal to be brought forward tomorrow because it is important that we act with some urgency on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sad reality that, since we signed the Kyoto Protocol, gas emission levels in Europe have gone up instead of down. It is high time that we assumed our responsibilities. These responsibilities lie primarily with the Member States and it is time, as I said, that we assumed our responsibility not only for the health of our population today, but for the protection of our environment for tomorrow's generations as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week's report indicated that three countries – Ireland, Spain and Italy – accounted for almost half of the five hundred infringements of environmental laws in the European Union over the last five years. This is an example of how Member States, having approved directives and transposed them, are failing to ensure that they are implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the urgent procedure was appropriate faced with the dreadful scourge of greenhouse gases and their consequences in terms of disrupting the climate, not to mention their impact on ecosystems and biodiversity. Indeed we saw their deadly effects this summer during the month of August.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also pay tribute to the Commission, which is proposing a more binding mechanism for implementing the commitments that we made in Kyoto in 1997. I might remind you that the Protocol, which was adopted the same year and ratified by the European Union in 2002, sets objectives in terms of emissions that the contracting parties must achieve by 2012: a reduction of 8%. The reference date for measuring this reduction still remains to be specified of course, without penalising those countries that made an earlier start on reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Latest studies to date show that, unfortunately, total emissions have been on the increase since 2000 and, if we are to believe the forecasts of the European Environment Agency for 2001, overall emissions in the European Union of the six gases deemed to be responsible for climate change are up by 1% on the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This proves that we need to strengthen the legal monitoring instrument that was implemented in the European Union through a decision in 1993, and that is the purpose of the proposal being examined and debated today. It confirms that the Member States are responsible individually for the conditions under which they participate in the Kyoto mechanism. That is a good thing, provided that effective coordination and proper monitoring are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">My group obviously welcomes the new requirements for improving the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures, including on emissions and the absorption of all greenhouse gases, as well as on the aspects relating to methodology.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also agrees with the rules stipulating how often this information needs to be provided and it also seems to me to be essential for the Commission to table a report to Parliament and the Council following its annual assessment of anticipated progress, measured on the basis of the estimated impact of policies and measures to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the rapporteur's example, my group therefore supports the request that the decision should become immediately effective. What we are actually requesting is for this exercise to be classified as a top priority. It is the future of our earth that is at stake and all of the measures taken in other existing and future texts need to comply with the framework and standards set out in Kyoto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by France and Finland to reduce their emissions between 1990 and 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal replaces the mechanism in operation since 1993 for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating progress towards meeting commitments in respect of these emissions. These proposals reflect the reporting requirements of the Marrakesh Accords to the Kyoto Protocol, including the use of flexible mechanisms and registries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to ensure that more information is available concerning the emission levels from within the Member States of the Union. We all agree on the importance of complying with the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. The earth's average surface temperature rose by around 0.06o Celsius during the 20th century. Evidence is getting stronger that most of the global warming over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. These activities relate to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which have caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see all industrialised countries take urgent action to reduce or limit future greenhouse gas emissions. Temperature increases can trigger serious consequences, with coastal areas flooded and the lives of many people living in island communities under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is implementing the European Climate Change Programme, which will ensure that the Union achieves the 8% cut in emissions between 2008 and 2012, which is our political commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has been called back to serve in the Portuguese Government. He will be missed, and particularly his expertise in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening we are dealing with a proposal for revising the monitoring mechanisms laid down in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the Kyoto Protocol. New rules are necessary for many reasons: scientific progress in the last decade, new elements such as carbon sinks, the transboundary nature of gas emissions and the obvious need for a Community approach and the harmonisation of rules in this area. In other words, as the European Environment Agency has told us, we need consistency and transparency in reporting on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, we view the proposal very positively. It is in our interest to have a structured system in place at EU level to assist in the development of our own domestic requirements. The proposal is also relevant for the assessment of national allocation plans under the proposed emissions trading directive, which is going through at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some concerns in relation to deadlines. I hope that they are practical and achievable, as regards the various aspects in the proposal. If they are practical and realistic, then it will be possible to insist on delivery from all Member States, even those that have difficulties in reaching targets in this area. If they are not practical and people are agreeing to them, then we will be giving hostages to fortune in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland's situation as regards Kyoto targets is, to be honest, fairly dismal. Ireland was offered 1990 levels, plus 13%. The last time we looked, emissions were already at 1990 levels, plus 22%. I understand that the EU average is currently at about 1% over. Ireland has a lot to do in this particular area and anything that can help us to collect our minds and deliver – as we must as a nation – is to be welcomed. I welcome the proposal before us here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This decision is another key piece of that jigsaw; therefore, the Commission can wholly endorse this first reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring and reporting are of course crucial, and I can reassure Members of Parliament that I will also do everything in my power to make sure that we report to citizens on how Member States are doing. We naturally base our information very much on the work of the European Environment Agency. We will return to this matter, but our assessment is that this is a feasible and practical system. That is not to say it will be easy for Member States. That is certainly not the case, but we will have to live up to our commitments, and I ask Parliament to conclude tomorrow by voting through the amendments with a resolute majority. In this way, the European Union and the European Community will reaffirm their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the commitment to put in place the necessary measures in the fight against problems of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything we do to demonstrate that we want and are able to live up to our commitments will also send a signal to the rest of the world – and in particular to a certain country which we want to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
