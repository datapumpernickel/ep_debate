This proposal for a regulation follows the path laid out in 1999 by the directive on vehicle registration documents, aimed at combating the legal trafficking in stolen vehicles, and must improve the functioning of the internal market, offering the service responsible for registration of vehicles better access to the biggest European database of stolen vehicles, namely the Schengen Information System.</p>
<p class="contents">Very important financial interests are at stake, as we all know, because every year millions of cars are registered in the States of the Union and thousands of these are stolen. Furthermore, by introducing more effective mechanisms for combating vehicle theft, the proposal will have an impact on the security of citizens and consequently on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, it provides for the possibility, before the registration of the vehicle, for the national services responsible, under certain conditions to consult the SIS database of stolen vehicles and registration documents and check whether the vehicle in question has already been registered in another State party to the Schengen Agreement. This information will make it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen vehicles in another ‘Schengen State’ and at the same time will increase the possibility of victims being able to recover their stolen vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities currently lack the resources to verify the origin of at least a million vehicles registered every year. The proposal currently being debated will allow for systematic access to the database, and therefore search for vehicles and registration documents and, in order to have access to it, a series of common rules on transparency and a series of principles on data protection will have to be adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with those rules will be monitored in a similar way to other searches carried out within the same SIS database. For the sake of data protection, it has been proposed to provide different access for public services and for private services responsible for the registration of vehicles. Officials of the public services responsible should have the right to directly consult the Schengen database, while, despite carrying out a public administration function, when the services carrying out this activity are private, they will have restricted access to it, via the police, like the other existing vehicle registration services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for the work you have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Car theft in the Member States has increased to one million, two hundred thousand vehicles per year. Indeed, this figure has been exceeded in previous years, and considerable losses have been incurred, totalling EUR 15 million. It is therefore essential that we fight this type of crime, which causes not only financial loss, but also physical and psychological damage, in view of the various forms of violence associated with car crime. Furthermore, as you have just stated, Commissioner, it affects the citizens’ sense of justice and security.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 3 300 vehicles are stolen every day, which corresponds to approximately one theft every 25 seconds. Since I began this speech, two vehicles have, in all likelihood, been stolen and I hope that neither of these belongs to any of the Members present. The purpose of modifying the Schengen Convention is to allow the public vehicle registration authorities direct access to certain categories of data contained in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Private vehicle registration services may only have the right to indirect access, via an authority with access to the SIS.</p>
<p class="contents">The SIS will thus become an even more important instrument in the fight against crime, enabling the authorities to check, quickly and efficiently, whether the vehicle whose registration has been requested has been stolen, misappropriated or lost. The functioning of the internal market will thus be improved, as the principle of free movement of goods is strengthened, and this, in turn, will help towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice and the implementation of the common transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Why direct access? In order to prevent, in good time, vehicles stolen in one country from being registered, and thereby legalised, in another. It is calculated that 30% to 40% of the vehicles concerned are stolen by criminal organisations, which then transform them and export them to other countries both inside and outside the EU. The whole operation usually takes less than 48 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two key arguments in favour, the first of which is efficiency. Several million cars are registered in the EU. It would be too much for the police to check all these cars systematically in the SIS. Some 15 million vehicles per year are presented for registration. Direct access, accordingly, makes it quicker and easier to check the legal status of a vehicle, which means greater efficiency. The second argument in favour is transparency. Currently, Member States have all found some way to ensure that it can be checked at the moment of registration of the car whether it has been stolen. The information that they receive is reasonably reliable, yet these methods are relatively opaque and complicated. Including an article in the Schengen Convention would confer greater transparency on the entire process.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of data are we speaking about? Access should only be given to data concerning vehicles with a cylinder capacity above 55 cc, and data concerning trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750 kg. It is proposed to increase access to data that are not yet covered by the SIS, namely data concerning registration certificates and number plates that have been stolen misappropriated or lost. This is the only way in which the desired aims can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish initiatives, which we welcome here, concerning the SIS’s new functions, in particular in the fight against terrorism, already provided for integrating these data in the SIS, but have yet to be adopted due to a parliamentary reserve by Denmark. We trust that those initiatives will be adopted as soon as possible. I propose the deletion, however, of the proposal on access to data concerning issued identity papers, in accordance with the advice of the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority, along with data concerning blank official documents. The scope of such a concept would be too wide-ranging and too vague.</p>
<p class="contents">The set of data accessible to vehicle registration authorities is, therefore, clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate. Access to those data deemed too sensitive will thus be removed and will be limited to objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves. I should like to call on this House to endorse this initiative and to reject the proposal tabled by the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Pacciotti, of the Socialist Group, which advocates keeping the current system of indirect access in place. Should that proposal be adopted, nothing will change and we will not make any headway in combating these crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that I have set out the case clearly by giving evidence of the numbers involved, which are ample illustration of the need to establish new ways of combating automobile crime. The situation, as it stands, must not be allowed to continue. Mrs Paccioti fears that by allowing direct access we will increase the risk of the misuse of personal data. I have always advocated the most rigorous protection for the fundamental rights of our citizens, including the right to the protection of personal data. In view of amendments that I have tabled to the Commission’s original proposal – all of which have been approved by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – I do not believe that the protection of personal data is jeopardised. The access given to the public vehicle registration authorities will be clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate, in other words, solely concerning objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves, in order to ascertain from the system whether or not the vehicle in question has been stolen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to reject this step would, to my mind, be a bad decision, as we would remain ineffective in combating this type of crime. It would also send out the wrong signal to our citizens, who want to see closer cooperation and greater efficiency in combating crime and in ensuring their security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is surely inevitable that, when databases are set up to store a large amount of information, there is then a temptation to use them for a wide variety of purposes. This may be useful and legitimate on certain conditions, particularly with regard to the citizens’ fundamental right to the protection of their personal data, as enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A demand has now arisen for vehicle registration agencies to be able to check whether a vehicle has been stolen and whether an applicant’s documents are genuine by obtaining all the necessary information stored in the Schengen Information System. Problems connected with the legal basis would seem to prevent the use of data relating to identity papers, according to the rapporteur, and so the information should be confined to data on motor vehicles. The draft regulation remains useful even with these limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">What I cannot agree with is that the information should not be supplied by the police or customs authorities who have responsibility for storing and processing Schengen data, but should be acquired directly by public registration agencies through direct access to the SIS database. This access by the huge number of vehicle registration bodies in the 25 Member States would be a serious threat to the protection of personal data stored in the Schengen system.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature of the services responsible for citizens’ security, the rules and controls to which they are subject, and the purposes for which they may use any data that may come to their knowledge are very different from those relating to administrative bodies, in the public sector or otherwise, that take care of vehicle registration. Besides, I cannot see what urgent need there is to allow direct access to Schengen data, given that this would not be allowed for any registration bodies that were private rather than public in nature under the rules of different countries. This would cause a disparity in rules that would increase confusion rather than make the provision more effective. It would be better, then, to regulate the use of Schengen data by vehicle registration agencies by allowing all of them the same indirect access, which would avoid any risk of abuse and would respect the principle of proportionality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I quote the report: ‘[The proposal] will make the SIS an even more prominent instrument to fight crime and… [promote] work towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice.’ Despite this, the legal basis for the proposal is transport policy – to which I am returning – namely Article 71. It pains me to say it, Commissioner and Mr Coelho, but this is a legal and juridico-political farce. I shall confine my remarks to three points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, regarding the Schengen project in general, which of course constitutes the most extensive system in world history of supervision and political and social control. From annual reports and surveys, we know that, in 2001, the Schengen Information System’s database contained more than ten million individual pieces of information. This most recently published figure is undoubtedly much larger today. Anyone with the slightest sense of justice must pose the following questions: Who may record what? Who may retrieve which information, and how may the information be used? A reading of the texts supplies no certain answers. The criteria are so elastic that it really is up to the system’s many users to define the limits; and the many users amount to approximately 125 000 terminals connected to the central database in Strasbourg. What, for example, is the meaning of Article 96 where, according to one of the conditions, people’s presence is assumed to constitute a threat to public order. Such uncertain criteria require thoroughgoing controls, but the system offers no real controls. </p>
<p class="contents">What is termed the Joint Supervisory Authority has, in several annual reports, expressed its lack of ability to function independently. The working conditions are so poor that the Supervisory Authority has declared that its supervision functions as an alibi for the use of police instruments. The Supervisory Authority possesses neither the independence nor the resources necessary for the system to function effectively and affords only modest guarantees in connection with the collection and exchange of information that takes place in the SIS and the even more advanced SIRNE system. This is the general background to the proposal, which is an extension of Schengen cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to my two supplementary questions to the acting Commissioner. The legal basis that I mentioned earlier completes the farce. It is Article 71, which deals with transport policy. It is absurd, regardless of the legal technicalities referred to by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in my own little country, Denmark, we have a special regulation pertaining to the extension of Schengen cooperation or the Schengen regulations. How does the Danish protocol work in this area, Commissioner? The mysterious legal basis is possibly the explanation of why the Danish Council representative, with whom I talked today, simply declared himself unfamiliar with the proposal. No wonder, either, if the proposal is camouflaged as transport policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his work in bringing this report before Parliament. I am sure that, like me, he is deeply impressed with the vast amount of support he has received from his colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and that side of the House in the list of speakers before us tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding that, this is an important issue. He has told us of the 1.2 million vehicles stolen in the European Union. Clearly, in every country there is a percentage of criminals who do not abide by laws and regulations. Presumably – and he may know better than I – these thieves have differing motives for their crimes. We must remember that a fraction – albeit a very small one – of these car thieves have very serious ulterior motives. Whether they are involved in illegal drugs, the supplying of illegal weapons or international terrorism, these are international issues which cross European borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues have expressed worries about data protection and concerns as to whether there are sufficiently robust safeguards contained in the Schengen Agreement. From the United Kingdom's point of view, it means that there will now be access to international data that will help in the fight against international cross-border crime, which we all take very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also those who are concerned about the idea of direct access to the data and the question as to whether there are sufficient guarantees for the protection of the data and the protection of citizens, and whether we are setting a dangerous precedent here. I share and understand those concerns. Nevertheless, as responsible citizens and elected representatives of the people, we need to do what we can in the fight against serious crime. The theft of vehicles is of course very important, but it is what it leads on to and all other aspects connected with it that must focus our attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
