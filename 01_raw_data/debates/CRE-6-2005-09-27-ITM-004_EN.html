<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you all know the position: the directive on asylum procedures has been the subject of negotiations in the Council for over four years; the outcome therefore reflects a fragile compromise among the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to be frank and say that it is a compromise that certainly does not rise to great heights of ambition. I am well aware of the concerns expressed in the report, and in part I share them. I therefore thank the rapporteur for the work he has done, even though the difficulties that we have encountered and the fact that the directive still does not aim very high are further good reasons – and I really mean no paradox in this – for Parliament to approve the report today and to make this complex procedure continue until the directive enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there are, first of all, excellent methodological reasons for adopting the report. Indeed, if the directive enters into force, any subsequent proposal on this topic will have to go through the system of qualified majority voting, not unanimity any more, and it will have to go through the codecision procedure involving the Council and Parliament. That means that, once the first stage is over with the approval of this directive, we shall have the prospect of Parliament having a codecision vote in the subsequent stages, which I consider to be about the substance. I am hopeful that we will achieve this result as soon as possible, just as soon as we approve the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are reasons regarding future prospects. Shifting the procedure from unanimity to qualified majority and from Parliament merely giving its opinion to codecision will allow us to achieve something that for me, perhaps, and I think for many others, is even more important: achieving a common European asylum system by 2010, involving not just the procedures any more, but the substance, the difference in concrete terms between European action and action just by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are other reasons, concerning content, which again justify your voting in favour. The directive is certainly just a first step, but you will all recall the Tampere Council several years ago when it was actually decided that Europe’s asylum strategy would be a step-by-step strategy, that is to say the procedure and the substance would not be put into effect at the same time together, but would proceed in stages. This is just a first step, I have to admit, but this first step will make a great difference, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I think I can say that we have more than 20 different systems for the procedures themselves. I will not say 25, but it is nearly that many. A number of concerns remain, as expressed by this Parliament and by the Commission, and also by me personally and in public, about the need to harmonise the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">With the directive, we shall have a common procedure and minimum standards across Europe and, most of all, I would say, we shall give the Court of Justice the power to apply and interpret them. As you well know, the case law of the Court of Justice is often highly advanced in its interpretation. We shall also then give the Commission the opportunity to enforce the common rules. These opportunities do not exist today and, in my opinion, they will make a considerable difference.</p>
<p class="contents">If, on the other hand, we were to stop today, if this step-by-step approach were not to go ahead, some of us would certainly continue to call for the text to be improved. I have to be frank, though: the Council is unlikely, highly unlikely, to reopen substantive talks after five years of negotiations. As a result, should the Council not intervene, there will be demands and there will probably be growing concerns, but that European strategy on the subject – procedures today and substance and legislation on asylum tomorrow – will not get under way.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, if we balance the advantages of a text that is not perfect against the serious dangers of a void in European legislation, which worries us even more, I strongly hope that this Parliament can adopt the report and issue a favourable opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union arose from the ruins of the Second World War, and its success is founded upon the lessons that we have learned from the experience of global war, of National Socialism and the dictatorships of the last century, not least in Eastern Europe, all of which obliged many Europeans, in order to save their own lives, to leave their homes and seek refuge in foreign countries. Today, people come to Europe seeking refuge from calamity and persecution. None of them have left their homelands lightly, for in fleeing they often take their lives in their hands. Their dream of a life in safety often ends, though, in reception centres where conditions are sometimes appalling, and then they are sent back to an allegedly safe country, such as Libya, without their individual situations being assessed. Are we trying to rid ourselves of every burden and responsibility as soon as possible? I get the impression that we, in Fortress Europe, are less interested in protecting the refugees than in doing the opposite and protecting ourselves from them. How, though, are we to discharge our historic responsibility if we do not give refugees an adequate opportunity to explain their reasons for coming here? How are we to be credible in defending European values if we deny those seeking protection access to legal processes? That there is the fear of asylum being abused is not a matter of doubt, but we must not allow that to induce us to betray our values. What is needed are common European minimum standards for the treatment of refugees, founded upon the rule of law and upon international conventions and obligations under international law such as the Geneva Convention on Refugees. The Council presented us with its proposal for this directive, for consultation purposes, only in November 2004, having already taken its decision. One might call this ‘uncooperative cooperation’, and it is something that we reject outright. What the Council has now presented us with is also a long way removed from the objectives formulated at Tampere in 1999, and one consequence of that is that the majority of us in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the advisory committees have come to the conclusion that the directive falls short of all expectations in that it makes no significant progress towards harmonisation, in that there are too many instances in which the Member States are allowed to retain their own legal arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">There are in particular a number of points that give great concern as regards respect for internationally-recognised human rights and the principles of the law as it applies to refugees, and so we have proposed a number of vitally important amendments. For a start, we reject the concept, set out in Article 35a, of what are termed ‘super-safe third countries’, that is in itself an outstanding achievement in terms of global philosophy, favouring instead a modification of the concept of ‘safe third countries’ in Article 27, which, it is important to note, we want to be applicable only if the third state has ratified, and complies with, the Geneva Convention and other international human rights treaties, adhering in particular to the principle of non-refoulement provided for in the Geneva Convention on Refugees. The person seeking asylum must have the opportunity to set out the reasons why his or her safety cannot be guaranteed in the ‘safe third country’ or in his or her safe country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to reinforce the asylum seeker’s right to an effective legal remedy in accordance with Article 38.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we call for the rights of children to be reinforced. Following on from the statement in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that every person under the age of 18 is to be regarded as a child, we have all – irrespective of our group allegiances – agreed that all relevant articles of the directive should be modified in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Fourthly, no asylum seeker should be arrested until such time as it is demonstrated that his or her incarceration is necessary, appropriate, and in line with the standards laid down in the international conventions. Asylum seekers should be detained only in institutions that are clearly distinguishable from prisons, and must be guaranteed access to proper legal advice, to properly trained and unbiased interpreters and to qualified medical personnel. Under no circumstances must unaccompanied children be interned as immigrants, nor must vulnerable persons such as victims of torture, traumatised persons, or persons with mental or physical handicaps, for whom the authorities should endeavour to find alternatives to internment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that I have presented, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, offers the opportunity to create Europe’s first body of asylum law, and a balanced and fair one too. Fear of Islamic terrorism and crime must not be used as a misguided excuse for a backwards-looking asylum policy. If we abandon the heart of asylum policy, we jeopardise human rights and take an axe to the pillars supporting that community of values that is the European Union. Fear is a poor basis for decision-making and hypocrisy is a reprehensible thing in politics. Human rights and human lives are at stake here, and neither we nor anyone else must forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about Commissioner Frattini’s concession. I hope that those who decided, perhaps some considerable time ago, that they were going to vote against the report, will now reconsider their position. I again urge you to vote to adopt my report, which we also need for next year’s negotiations with the Council. I urge you to vote in favour of it for the good of all, and, not least, in remembrance of all those Europeans who were forced into exile by war, ethnic cleansing and persecution.</p>

<p class="contents">One danger arising from the planned introduction of a minimum common list of what are termed ‘safe third countries’ is the major one that the Member States will return asylum-seekers to countries of origin that are regarded as ‘safe third countries’ without either the reasons for these individuals having become refugees being heard or their entitlement to asylum being examined. It is for that reason that I, in the opinion I drafted on the report for the Committee on Development, attach particular importance to the European Parliament being fully involved in all future decisions affecting the common list.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion or deletion from a minimum common list of states that can be – or cannot be – regarded as safe third countries must not be a matter for the Council or the Commission alone. This is demanded in the report on which we are to vote, as are improved protection for children and minors and the rules relating to the Member States’ obligation to inform refugees of their rights and obligations in a language that they understand.</p>
<p class="contents">The report includes a number of very important amendments aimed at ensuring that no Member State can deport asylum seekers or return them to areas where their life or freedom would be at risk by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or their holding particular political views.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask my fellow-Members of this House to give the report their backing.

The first proposal was tabled five years ago; in 2001, Parliament tabled over one hundred amendments in the Watson report; the Council spent two years in negotiations and finally arrived at the general approach in April 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very disappointed that the European Parliament was only consulted after the Council had reached a political agreement, which means that, in practice, the Council will now pay no attention to this debate; the Council’s absence from the Chamber sums up perfectly its attitude to this debate. The fact is, as Mr Frattini said, the directive is an important one. This first step towards setting a European asylum system in motion is one we must take as a matter of urgency, and this proposal for a directive is the first legally binding instrument dealing with the asylum process. We must set up common asylum arrangements so that we can manage migratory flows in the most effective and fairest way possible, both for immigrants and for the host societies. This must, moreover, be done without breaching the 1951 Geneva Convention, with particular regard to the principle of <span class="italic">non-refoulement</span>, whereby no State will return such people to countries or territories in which their lives or freedoms will be endangered.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we must take on board the fact that the Member States wish to combat the abuse of asylum systems by economic migrants. I should like to commend the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on his work. I supported many of his amendments, and similarly most of my proposals were incorporated, with regard to humanitarian issues and the protection of asylum seekers’ rights, the need for rapid and effective procedures, detention conditions and the protection of minors and others who may be vulnerable. We disagree, however, on two key points, namely the disappearance of the lists of safe countries, which already existed in some Member States, and the scrapping of the concept of the ‘super-safe’ country.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask for separate voting on several amendments. The concept of ‘super-safe’ country certainly applies to European third countries, such as Switzerland, which uphold very high standards of human rights and refugee protection. This concept was a success when it was implemented in Germany; there was a reduction in the number of cases of abuse and in the number of people seeking asylum. Some people believed that this solution contravened the Geneva Convention and that it breached the principle of <span class="italic">non-refoulement.</span> This is why we consulted Parliament’s legal service, which has just issued an opinion stating that we were right, and that the safe countries solution is fully compatible with the international obligations to which we are bound.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reintroduced an amendment that was not adopted in committee, which proposes that an effective system should be in place whereby the asylum seeker will always have the right to appeal a decision and to await the subsequent decision in the country in which he applied for asylum. If these amendments are adopted, I feel that we will have a report that matches our responsibilities, and the Council would do well to follow our lead. If we keep the amendments contained in the initial version, I fear that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will not be able to lend its backing to the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must support him so that the European Parliament might express a forceful opinion on this crucial issue. The report, which is extremely well-balanced, is a good text upon which to base the drafting of an asylum and immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must maintain a strong position in the drafting of this policy. On the eve of the transition to the codecision stage in the area of asylum policy, I call on the Council to restore good faith among the European institutions by demonstrating that it is ready to listen to the European Parliament. As it stands, the Council’s text does not, in fact, really allow harmonisation of the asylum policies to take place at European level. On the contrary, it grants the Member States too many possible derogations and exceptions. Furthermore, these derogations prevent us from attaining a good common denominator; it is, rather, the case that the lowest common denominator is given precedence: the levelling down of the asylum policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we wish to point out that Europe is truly a land of asylum and that we must protect this humanitarian tradition. Europe’s asylum policy must first guarantee a high level of protection to people seeking asylum, by enhancing their fundamental rights. Are we only aware of just how lucky we all are to have been born in Europe? Well, the principle of so-called ‘super safe’ third countries is unacceptable, since it is a violation of asylum seekers’ rights. Everyone has the right to make an individual request and to have his or her request individually assessed. A person can very easily be persecuted in a country that, on the surface of it, is safe. History has provided us with sufficient evidence of that, if only in the 20th century. The safe country principle can be very dangerous if it is not strictly controlled and, consequently, it would be unacceptable to end up with 25 different lists.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must also carry out a leading role in the drafting of this list, and we owe it to ourselves to ensure that this right is observed. What do we want? We are calling for people’s dignity to be respected. Let us remember that Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the right to dignity. Go and visit the refugee detention centres in various Member States and you will be enlightened. Go and visit them and you will be appalled that people could treat refugees in such a fashion. You will be filled with shame, as I was. We must rectify the flaws in the asylum policy. We must protect the refugees. We must also address our people in order to explain to them, and thus to make them understand, the hardship that literally forces these refugees to make their way to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For once, I am in total agreement with him: fear is a bad adviser.</p>
<p class="contents">Our guiding principle must be that the European Union, as an area without internal borders, must find a common and effective way of managing its external borders. The development of a common asylum and immigration policy forms an integral part of this. Despite the fact, though, that Member States have expressed this ambition themselves, it is with only the greatest of difficulty that this policy is getting off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Under pressure from public opinion, for which, in fact, national governments and parliaments are often to blame themselves, most Member States are currently adopting their own asylum and migration policy that is as closed off as possible, even though a change to the asylum and migration policy in one Member State has a direct impact on the migration waves and policy developments in the others. As the also rapporteur indicated, the drawback of a working method such as this is that the political refugee entitled to asylum appears to be at risk of being pushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">In the public debate, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are increasingly lumped together, and, if we are not careful, the terrorists against whom we must fight will be joining them there in the foreseeable future. This trend has to be broken as quickly as possible, and that is why a European approach is necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, this House will be voting on the proposal for a directive concerning minimum standards in the Member States for granting or withdrawing refugee status. The proposal <span class="italic">per se</span> is of little interest; it is in fact no more than a collection of policies that apply in the 25 Member States. It is disappointing that there is hardly any sign of harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been noted that the European Parliament has only advisory powers with regard to the proposal. Advice may be very useful, but it can, above all, also be ignored, and that is exactly what the Council will do. However, as soon as the final vote has been taken on this report and the directive thereby enters into effect, the European Parliament will acquire codecision in the areas of asylum and immigration, which means that the Council will no longer take decisions by unanimous, but by majority, vote. This amendment to the decision-making procedure is vital, as is the need to adopt common asylum and immigration policy in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that we may send out a powerful political message to the Council, I would urge the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), particularly Mr Coelho, but also those of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to opt for the most viable compromise and thus refrain from voting against this report. My group has demonstrated its willingness to do this. There is one area that remains difficult for us, namely the concept of the supersafe countries, but I would be very surprised if a majority were to be found for that this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">A powerful political signal from this House is what is needed to demonstrate that we, across the political divide, dare fight for a speedy, balanced European approach to the asylum and immigration issue. Our visit to Lampedusa last week confirmed for me the need to do this. The directive is merely a first step, displaying little ambition so far, but a first step all the same, the importance of which we should not underestimate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off by saying that, quite honestly, the fact that the Council is not represented here at the moment, cannot, in my view, be reconciled with the priorities that it set forth before, which is something that I deeply regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has had an extremely difficult task in trying to improve the deeply flawed document received from the Council, which some of us see as an affront to human rights and to those seeking sanctuary. I find it very depressing that this 'fragile compromise', as it was described, was the best anyone could come up with. It simply encapsulates a lot of what Member States are already doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to the concept of super-safe third countries and indeed safe third countries. My political group has a major problem with this. At the moment the British Government, for example, is prepared to send asylum seekers back to Iraq, Congo, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. Some of us are dealing at the moment with the case in which not only is someone being returned to Iran, but his British Christian wife is going with him, with the government paying her fare. That is all very generous.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many in this House who do not believe any of those countries to be safe. Therefore the minimum that we want, if we are to accept this flawed concept of safe third countries, is a unified list decided under codecision with Parliament, which would be a step towards a common asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are deeply concerned at the implications for non-refoulement, particularly as we are also witnessing an attack on Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the issue of not returning people to a situation in which they might face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. We welcome the amendment from the rapporteur and Mrs Roure that keeps open the possibility of testing the human rights dimension of this in the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee's amendments have strengthened the text quite considerably. There is much greater emphasis, for example, on the rights of children and procedures for the vulnerable. There is much greater clarity as regards the need for adequate legal representation and an individual interview, which assumes even greater importance in the context of the single asylum procedure currently under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the commitment to adequate interpretation. Everyone in this House knows how important skilled interpreters are. However, our lives are not dependent on them, whereas quality of interpretation can be absolutely crucial to an asylum seeker's future.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of detention is an extremely vexed subject, to put it mildly. However, arbitrary detention with no possibility of appeal is totally unacceptable. We believe, therefore, that the committee has done a good job in tightening the legal requirements surrounding this and making it clear that detention is not imprisonment when you have been accused of no crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the Council has already made up its mind, and we take note of that, as we do of its absence here today, and it will most probably take no account of any suggestions emanating from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Kreissl-Dörfler report improves the directive put before us, particularly in that it deletes the part about super-safe countries and increases the margin for appeal against any refusal.</p>
<p class="contents">Some major unresolved issues still remain, however, which we cannot sidestep. I am thinking in particular of the role of consular authorities, who should not be allowed to meet asylum seekers under any circumstances. There remains the issue that asylum seekers should not be held in detention centres. We have just visited Lampedusa and seen how the mixing of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants generates barbaric relations inside detention centres. In our opinion, these people should not be held in the same places; indeed, we believe that asylum seekers should never be shut up at all. If it is absolutely necessary, steps must be taken to ensure that they are not held in the same places and in any case not for six months.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are concerned about the use made in the report of the safe third country concept, about the criteria for defining a safe third country, and also about how the list of such countries will be drawn up. To us this is an extremely important point: by definition, a safe third country obviates case-by-case assessment, in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria. Asylum is not a concession: it is Europe’s moral and political duty and a right for men and women who are being persecuted or are fleeing from wars.</p>
<p class="contents">Which are these safe countries? According to the criteria, even Morocco or Belarus, for instance, could be considered safe countries, places that we have chosen to consider privileged partners, and this also results in a process of externalising the Union’s borders. I believe that safe third countries and the concept of safe third countries endanger the lives of asylum seekers, and that is something that we must not allow.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that Parliament has too little control; codecision will only apply when modifying the list of safe third countries. Mr Frattini says that the report has been arranged step by step. In my view, this step has not been bold enough: we could have aspired to and demanded much more. The harmonisation that we have produced is probably such that it even makes some national legislations worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let it be clear that talking about refugees from our position cannot, and indeed should not, be without any consequences. It is our duty to treat refugees kindly and fairly. One and a half weeks ago, it became painfully clear once again how little prepared we in the European Union are to provide clarity and transparency in respect of refugee treatment. I fear that Lampedusa is no exception. An even-handed and fair European asylum policy can only exist if the Member States are open about the way they treat their refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that have been tabled to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler’s report show no evidence of any priorities having been set. If this Parliament had wanted to express clear requests, we would have been better off sticking to the main points. Instead, alongside the Council’s political agreement, this House has produced a very extensive document. In a consultation procedure, there is little scope for re-writing a Council proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two important points. This proposal makes it possible for an application for asylum to be rejected on the basis of a combination of different exceptions. Member States are apparently not prepared to allow their own exceptions to be discussed in order to reach an even-handed directive, and that is unacceptable. Moreover, there are insufficient guarantees in the directive to accompany the accelerated procedure. There is a lack of both clear criteria and sufficient guarantees that this procedure will not be at the expense of the fairness of the normal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point is what the Council intends to do with Parliament’s amendments; it is very regrettable that the Council is not present to set that out in detail, which is what I would like it to do. Commissioner Frattini doubts whether the Council is prepared to adopt any amendments from Parliament. It should be possible, though, to enter into a dialogue with the Council on a limited number of points that we regard as essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see that as symptomatic of the extent to which this Parliament is taken into account. Alas, poor us!</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while I agree with the rapporteur in calling for greater cooperation among the institutions and in considering that Parliament should always be consulted before the Council comes to any kind of agreement, I should, however, like to express my disappointment at the contents of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the document, the rapporteur laments the lack of significant progress in terms of harmonisation, but he does not take into account the different perceptions that countries can have about the immigration problem. When I speak of immigration, I deliberately call it a problem: there is no denying that the so-called fringe countries of the European Union suffer most from veritable assaults by immigrants, who sometimes arrive with good intentions, admittedly, but are none the less illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of a Community immigration policy, one that is both intelligent and practical, I consider it fair for the Member States to reserve the right to examine only those applications that are considered serious and possibly to reject them. Some Members, however, insist on wanting to consider immigration to be a non-Community problem; they imagine that the individual Member States should bear the exorbitant costs that these waves of migration involve.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments that go against the Council proposals have been adopted. The definition of ‘safe third country’ has in effect been eliminated, preventing Member States from rejecting applicants deemed unsuitable even if they come from countries considered to observe freedoms and human rights. If this Parliament – perhaps because it is too politically correct – wishes to ignore the fact that immigrants, especially those who come through my own country, Italy, get into Europe and almost always end up committing crimes and jeopardising the safety of our citizens, then perhaps it would be better to have the courage to say that each country should regulate itself as it sees fit, that is to say with 20 different kinds of legislation. In that case, however, the Left should not go on about a united Europe: they are the only ones being hypocritical; we on the right are certainly not! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It therefore goes without saying that these instruments are wholly inappropriate to offer an answer to the current asylum problems, particularly the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are coming to Europe from all over the world in search not only of refuge but also of economic fortune and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore right and proper that we should look for an answer to this problem in the shape of a common European refugee policy, and I would certainly endorse the drafting of a list of safe countries, even if this was a first step and even if – subsidiarity being properly understood – it was left to the individual Member States to use additional lists. This can, however, only be a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">A real solution to the problems can only be arrived at once we have the courage to decide that the reception of asylum seekers should take place on the relevant asylum seekers’ continent, and preferably in the regions, of origin, and no longer, therefore, in Europe. This reception must, contrary to what has been repeated here <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span>, be done in closed and very strictly controlled centres; only those who, following a strict and proper examination, are recognised as <span class="italic">bona fide</span> refugees can then be received in third countries, possibly also within the European Union. That is the only way to drastically reduce the number of bogus asylum applications and combat human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this is also the only way of reconciling our citizens, whom we represent, in our own countries, with the need to receive genuine asylum seekers. Since unfortunately, the asylum concept has become more or less synonymous with deception and social fraud, rightly so, for which we can certainly have human understanding, we should not be politically responsible or indeed, be a political accomplice.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, though, we lack the political will or courage to adopt such bold and necessary policy, certainly with regard to everything that this entails, such as, for example, the refusal of development aid to countries that refuse to conclude repatriation agreements for bogus asylum seekers. The present report is, unfortunately, an illustration of this political unwillingness, given the fact that it weakens already meek and timid Council proposals even further, and it is for those reasons that we will, with regret, be unable to endorse this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an humanitarian obligation incumbent on us not only as individual states, but also as a European Union, and the fact that that Union’s internal borders are open makes it important that we at least lay down a minimum standard for asylum procedures, with it made clear not only to asylum-seekers but also to the host countries what prior conditions apply, what form the procedures take, and how long they should take.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of humanitarian obligation that procedures should be transparent and quick, and that they should treat people with dignity, and this is an obligation that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes very seriously, as is evident from the amendments tabled by our shadow rapporteur Mr Coelho – which the Committee accepted – in contrast to the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which does nothing to help us meet our humanitarian obligations. The fact is that what matters is not that we should accept as many people as possible, but that we should offer a safe haven to those who are persecuted in their own country and for whom Europe is their only possible place of refuge. At the same time, we must be clear in our own minds about the evident fact that the right of asylum is also misused, and so, in order to make room for people who really are persecuted, we have to deter manifestly unfounded applications. Using a list of safe third countries helps to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Practice in Germany has shown this to be a sensible and workable arrangement, although it must be noted that inclusion in the list of safe third countries is conditional upon acceptance and implementation of both the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights – a high standard that we have set for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this concept of safe third countries and safe countries of origin that the rapporteur rejects, with the consequence that, for example, neither Canada nor Norway nor Switzerland are regarded as safe countries for asylum-seekers. I have to tell him that they should be included in any procedure, and, while our Green and Socialist Members reject Bulgaria and Romania as safe states, they nonetheless want them to accede to the EU in a few months’ time. That is inherently contradictory. Moreover, in the original version of his report, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler went as far as to demand that criminals for whom an arrest warrant had been issued should be granted asylum before they were arrested. He also, citing cultural sensitivities, rejected the fingerprinting of asylum-seekers, even though that is often the only way to positively identify those who have arrived without papers, and that would make it virtually impossible to determine whether a person had applied for asylum in more than one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Kreissl-Dörfler I have to say that the adoption of his report in its present form would, in my view, be a disservice to many serious applicants for asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why does the Council insist on there being super safe countries when we ourselves recognise that some of them do not comply with basic principles of law and that this would also result in the repatriation of refugees?</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Council insist that each Member State should be allowed to have its own list of safe countries and why does it persist in refusing a common list, with the result that each country includes its friends and ‘customers’, even if other Member States do not trust them?</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Council insist on ignoring the Convention on the Rights of the Child and persist in discriminating against 17-year-olds? Is it perhaps because the rate of refugees is increasing or perhaps because we have a deluge on the European borders? No, it is not, because refugee applications have fallen recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as the rapporteur said, the problem is the fear which exists in certain countries from terrorist attacks and the fear created in other countries by unemployment or the violation of social protection networks. Fear seeks scapegoats and the easy scapegoats are the persecuted of this world.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe is not only a geographical and economic continent; it is also a humanitarian continent. We have the same obligation to protect our geographical borders as we do to protect our humanitarian borders. We have brought our light to the planet. The international conventions we talk about here bear the stamp of European humanitarianism and we cannot, on the basis of fear, insecurity and even sometimes racism, attack and violate our own humanitarian borders.</p>

What this House is doing today is an expression of its innate responsibility for the defence of human rights, and not just of any old right, but of what is perhaps the most ancient human right known to man, the right of asylum, which can be seen as derived from the laws of hospitality, and which was, to the most ancient of human cultures, sacrosanct. If we are to scrutinise these decisions, we need to look into the mirror of history. If the defence of human dignity can be threatened by fears and public moods, it is scarcely to our credit and does not say much for our courage and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council consults Parliament, so let it be said in the plainest of language what we are dealing with here: interference with fundamental rights, the police, and the laws of Member States, and none of it with any parliamentary legitimacy. No wonder people in this EU of ours are putting up resistance, howling with outrage at the democratic deficit, the gaps in fundamental rights and in the monitoring of what goes on. To what kind of pass has Europe come? How it is possible for fundamental rights to be interfered with without Parliament having any say in what is decided?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council consults us, yet it itself is not present; the Council wants to listen to Parliament, and yet it is not here! Why, though, should it be? The fact is that the Council is consulting us only after it has already concluded an agreement, only after its members have done a deal among themselves. Heads of Government are not in the least aware of the fact that it goes against our culture for ministers of the interior, ministers with responsibility for the police, to make laws for themselves, to interfere with fundamental rights, to make the most difficult decisions about the balance between security and human rights without reference to Parliament. We are, admittedly, being consulted, but the Council is not here.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of this initiative by the Council is to put Europe beyond the reach of refugees, to make a mockery of the right of asylum and to make it, in essence, null and void. That is the state we are in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the Council has already agreed and, from one point of view, the debate being held here is entirely cosmetic. The directive follows on from the overall anti-refugee policy of the European Union because, as you know, the percentage of applicants granted refugee status has plummeted in the European Union over recent years. In Greece, for example, it is less than 1% of applicants and last year the number of asylum applications plummeted.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining the concept of a safe to super safe third country, which means repatriation to it without the application being examined, refusing in practice the right to asylum and imprisoning immigrants pending a decision by the authorities demonstrate the European Union’s indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said about the humanitarianism of the European Union. It is hugely ironic: on the one hand you unleash wars and plunder countries in the developing world and, on the other hand, you pretend that you pity the victims of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with the exception of the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, are gratuitously critical of the directive in that, to all intents and purposes, they accept the basic anti-refugee approach.

We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma, the economic persecution in East Timor, the religious persecution in Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for conceiving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child. There is the persecution of disabled people in some communist countries and the persecution based on tribal origin in the Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">Billions of people live under the threat of persecution. When that threat moves closer and they must escape, we must receive them. It is a human imperative, but also a deeply ingrained cultural imperative in Europe. From the earliest times many of us learned the story of St Joseph taking the child and his mother to Egypt because King Herod planned to kill him.</p>
<p class="contents">This report highlights the need for real effective guidelines and standards for refugees. I understand this need well. I have lobbied for genuine refugees in my own country, largely unsuccessfully. I think particularly of two Ukrainian doctors who narrowly escaped death after exposing a government-licensed trade in human tissue obtained from aborted but living 20-week-old foetal babies. Those doctors – a consultant oncologist and a paediatrician – who sacrificed their whole careers for their courageous action, have been in Ireland for over a year in an overcrowded hostel with no certainty that they will not be sent back to persecution and death. Our response in Ireland, from what I know of other EU countries, tends to be slow and ungenerous. In the face of genuine asylum-seeking, this is not good enough. Regardless of third countries, can we even call our own EU countries safe countries? We should not automatically presume. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should also be borne in mind, however, that there are few genuine asylum seekers. For instance, I have encountered many asylum seekers in Belgium, but none of them really met the relevant conditions. Indeed, genuine political activists tend to be reluctant to leave their country of origin because they feel they have a lot to do there.</p>

My first general remark is that I myself was an official participant in the Tampere European Council in October 1999, exactly six years ago. There we drew up the 10 Tampere milestones to show how we could make progress in these matters, for example. Unfortunately, progress has been very slow.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the Constitution, which Franco Frattini was also involved in drafting. It is regrettable to hear how those who opposed the Constitution here in Parliament would at the same time like a firmer policy on asylum. These go hand in hand, and I personally, at least, hope that the Constitution comes into effect in some form or another as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I wish to make three detailed observations. Firstly, this is the only part of the Common European Asylum System, adopted back in 1999, which has not been decided upon. I do not believe it is right to sulk about whether the European Parliament was listened to or not. What is most important is that this programme should now be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns the list of safe countries. It is my opinion that a list of safe countries at EU level is vitally important and a very sensible idea. A list of this kind is necessary, and it is fine if, after the directive has come into effect, these decisions are taken by a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express my support for the rapporteur. He is worried that a negative decision on asylum might be enforced even if the time for making an appeal is still not over. Obviously, this cannot be allowed to happen. For that reason, I support the rapporteur on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is benefiting today from the European Parliament’s contribution and efforts, so that we can realign ourselves with the spirit of the Tampere Council, which has been mentioned several times today, and also so as to overthrow the primacy of fear as the only political element, the only criterion for action in our policies on immigration and the right to asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, it is important to oversee the implementation of the directive as amended and to ensure that it really does become the new Europe-wide legislation that is implemented in all our countries. Above all, with regard to the new definition of a safe third country, we must avoid – if I may say so, Mr President – certain fanciful interpretations that we have heard today from the benches on the right: a safe third country for us means adopting a European list of safe countries, and adopting it under the responsibility of Parliament as a party in the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Objective, precise conditions are needed: precisely the opposite of what is happening today. Thousands of migrants leave Lampedusa to be expelled and sent to Libya, which is anything but a safe country, Mrs Klamt; and when people are sent from the United Kingdom to Iraq, they are going to a country that is anything but a safe third country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a case of changing the function of Parliament. Today we are not offering the Council a polite suggestion; instead, we are calling for clear, strict and responsible rules.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that the basic problem is to make the Council and all the European institutions understand that Europe today cannot simply look after itself, but that it must instead look after the rights of those who are now suffering the violence of war and the humiliation of persecution. In view of all that, we must ask ourselves whether the problem is that we receive the asylum applications or rather whether the problem is the war and persecution from which those refugees are fleeing. Even before we put it to the European institutions, that is a question that we should put to our own consciences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where human rights are concerned, it is important that the European Union should function as a role model for other states outside it, yet resolutions such as these all too readily jeopardise them. How, in future, are we to compel other states to comply with international law on asylum if we no longer take it seriously within the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">I find it a matter of concern that the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, at the meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Newcastle on 9 September, argued that the European Convention on Human Rights might need to be reinterpreted. He would like to be able to deport preachers of hatred and terrorists – who are, admittedly, frightening presences on the contemporary scene – even if they face torture or the death penalty in their country of origin. This I regard as no more and no less than a flagrant disregard of international asylum law. It is quite clear to me, and to my group, that the ‘super-safe third countries’ rule is unacceptable. Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has already referred to this, and I endorse his criticism of it. It is obvious that the Council needs to make improvements here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A policy of speeding up procedures and of rigorous deportations has made it possible for them to reduce the flood of asylum-seekers by up to 50% and to save millions that would have been spent on pointless casework. They are nevertheless adhering strictly to the definition of refugees as laid down in international conventions and, by so doing, have even managed to increase the numbers whose claims are being recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, this prevents the exploitation of the social security system; on the other, the effect was to make the proceedings more humane and welcoming for genuine refugees and enabled them to be speedily integrated by means of obligatory courses on the country’s language and customs, essential in making a new start in a new home.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to wipe out Europe’s people-trafficking industry, which is a cause of suffering and unending misery, if we want to prevent those granted asylum from being drawn into the criminal milieu and to help those refugees who have not come to us for economic reasons alone, applications for asylum without a genuine need for asylum being demonstrated are simply no longer acceptable. As for whether this report constitutes a step in the right direction, that is, in my view, a matter of doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now as we can see in Malta's case, the countries of Southern Europe, have been left to fend for themselves, and consequently they are facing a national crisis. However, to develop a common policy, we must not look only at the obligations which each country has to face, but we must also see how the burden can be shared. Unfortunately, Europe is still far from the situation where the burden of this problem can be shared equally between everyone and there are countries who are carrying a much heavier load than they can actually carry. And let us be realistic, the burden must not be carried only by European countries, but it should be carried also by the countries from which the migrants originate, as well as transit countries, such as Libya. What can be done in order that countries of origin, especially those considered ‘safe countries’ would cooperate? What can be done so that a transit country such as Libya, fulfils its obligations also by, amongst other things, entering into a repatriation agreement? These are the questions which we should also be asking. Especially, we should address this subject, Mr President, in a holistic way, especially when deciding which countries should be considered 'safe' or 'super-safe'. I say ‘Yes’ for a common European policy, but a policy of solidarity where the burden is shared equally, and a policy which is coherent and insistent with third countries, so that they too should burden their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish off with a comment about the role of Parliament. We must be careful, because if this Parliament imposes on the Member States burdens which are too heavy, then we should not be surprised if the Council ignores us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us all to work towards the same goal: that the EU should, in the long run, conduct a policy on refugees and asylum that is the same for everyone everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules concerning safe or very safe countries give rise to a disturbing and unclear legal picture and lead to refugees being treated differently in different countries. My own country, Sweden, does not apply general rules or the concepts of ‘safe countries of origin’ and ‘safe third countries’. Instead, we see all refugees as individuals and consider each of them on an individual basis. A Member State can then assess refugees’ individual histories and their need to have their reasons considered. A country may be safe for a group, collectively, but be impossible for an individual or family to return to, precisely because the person or people concerned may have been politically active in union work or belong to a non-governmental organisation engaged in activities that incur disapproval.</p>
<p class="contents">I naturally also view with unease the fact that, in both international contexts and the EU, children’s and young people’s age of majority is tampered with. No one is grown up at the age of 16, either in these or in other cases. I hope that, with the help of this report, we shall make some headway in the process that, in time, should provide us with a common policy on refugees and asylum in the EU. That is what people in the EU want us to do because they want to see the EU as a single entity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of the directive we are debating is to establish a simple, clear, effective and humanitarian system for dealing with refugees in the European Union according to a common set of minimum standards. The system must also respect human rights. This directive is certainly needed, because not all Member States of the European Union have in place national systems for dealing with refugees. Immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees are a problem for the Union as a whole. All the Member States are affected, regardless of the number of refugees they have to deal with. A refugee who files an application in Poland is not simply a problem for Poland. That refugee should be a concern for countries a long way away from Poland, because he or she is likely to relocate. Consequently, issues and policies pertaining to refugees have a European dimension and should be dealt with at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have fallen into a trap as we discuss this directive. We have allowed ourselves to be swayed by our natural fear of terrorism, which might actually be more of an obsession. We cannot allow ourselves to perceive every refugee as a potential terrorist. It is important to keep the right balance between our normal justified fears for our own security on the one hand, and traditional European hospitality on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Another comment I would like to make is that the European Parliament cannot remain on the sidelines as the policy on asylum is developed. I was surprised to note today that it has fallen to the European Parliament to call for compliance with international law. We would like to point out to the House that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is not being complied with, and in addition, the 1967 Additional Protocol has not been implemented. These shortcomings could be remedied if the relevant amendments are accepted at the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The House should support this directive, because it will serve as a kind of safety valve Europe sorely needs. Millions of refugees are eagerly awaiting it, and we could help these people by ensuring minimum standards and fair treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken good note of their comments. There are certainly non-negotiable values in Europe: protecting the life and dignity of every person is an institutional and, above all, a moral duty of ours, and in that respect I thank the rapporteur for having emphasised that and also other speakers for having repeated it clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union should acknowledge and uphold this basic right for anyone who is truly fleeing persecution or war, but I mean truly fleeing. There is in fact another very clear point, mentioned by Mrs Klamt, amongst others: it is important to avoid abuse; it is important to distinguish clearly between those who are true refugees and are actually fleeing, and those who are economic migrants instead.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of credibility. The European strategy requires precise laws and sure means of enforcing them. That is the only way in which we can give a truly shared and sharable response both to those who would have fear prevail and to those who would have the duty of giving a welcome prevail. Both extremes can, I believe, find common ground if we give ourselves transparent laws and clear rules for implementing them, with no more grey areas between what is allowed and what is not.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the directive can and must enter into force as soon as possible. In that way, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be able to avoid retaining those legislative differences between Member States that often result in differential treatment for people who are in the same situation. That, too, is a serious violation, when someone in one Member State is in the same situation as someone else in another Member State but is treated differently.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a serious injustice, which the directive can in some way reduce and eliminate. That is why a Europe-wide measure is needed, and I fully agree with that, even though, as many of you have realistically pointed out, it is difficult to imagine that the Council will fully reopen the debate on points of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you – I will mention Mr Fava and Mrs Lambert in particular – have brought up a very important issue: the European list of safe countries. Well, I am aware that there are problems with the legal basis, and I know that the Council is making a forceful case for having only the consultation procedure apply when the list is drawn up. Regardless of the formal legal bases for drawing up the list of safe countries, I believe – and I am personally in favour of this – that it is essential to work with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There are formal legal issues with the legal basis, but there are also substantive political issues. I will mention a variety of subjects: the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the data retention question – in other words, topics on which I have proposed that this Parliament should work within a substantive political, interinstitutional agreement, whatever the formal legal bases. Therefore, why should we not also explore the possibility of the Council and Parliament working together on a subject that is clearly sensitive, as Mr Coelho said as well? I frankly agree with many of the comments that have been made: it is difficult to imagine that the Council will now, after four years of negotiations, simply drop the list of safe countries idea. Let us try, then, to give it what I see as a political boost that will involve Parliament much more than Parliament has been involved up to now!</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I conclude by hoping once more that you will vote for the directive, since voting for it would mean giving substance to that idea of European solidarity that Mr Busuttil has just recalled: European solidarity means sharing responsibilities and also burdens, and it means standing up to the opinions of those who would like to have exclusively national approaches. In my view, Parliament has a chance to give a political response of that kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
