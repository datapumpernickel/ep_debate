<p>(EN) The Council has decided to launch the EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 2 December 2004. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1575, adopted on 22 November 2004, provides the mandate for Operation ALTHEA. This mandate refers to the implementation of the military aspects of Annex 1A and 2 of General Framework Agreement of Peace.</p>
<p>The execution of EUFOR tasks is based upon the Operation Plan approved by the Council. The Operation plan details the rights and obligations of EUFOR. It also provides guidance with regard to all legal aspects of the EUFOR mission, including aspects relating to the implementation of internationally recognised standards of human rights and professional standards of behaviour. Member States and non-EU participating third States have the responsibility to train the forces to respect and abide by general international law, conventions and treaties applicable to the military operation.</p>
<p>Implementation of the guidance laid down in the Operation Plan is the responsibility of the EUFOR Commander. Exercise of jurisdiction is regulated through the status of forces agreements relating to EUFOR. As in any international military operation, the responsibility for investigation and, if required, prosecution of allegations of misconduct is the responsibility of contingent commanders and the competent authorities of the sending State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0448"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has underlined during the negotiations on the “Framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug traffic” the importance of taking a strong stance against drug trafficking at all levels and emphasised the need for a transnational and coherent approach in combating drug trafficking. Nevertheless, it is the Presidency's view that recently agreed pertinent texts on drugs such as the Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking and the EU Drugs Strategy, don't provide or imply that coffee shops in the Netherlands will be forced to close down within five years.</p>
<p>In the EU Drugs Strategy to be endorsed by the European Council (tomorrow) it is affirmed that the evaluation of the functioning of the above mentioned Framework Decision including its effect on international judicial co-operation in the field of illicit drug trafficking, will form an integral part of the strategy.

<p>(EN) The Council exchanged views prior to the Kosovo Assembly elections on 23 October 2004 and</p>
<p>looked forward to the elections being conducted in a peaceful and democratic environment and in a</p>
<p>free and fair manner, with the widest participation of all communities. In fact, international observers agreed that the elections were conducted in line with international standards and in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. However, the very low turnout of Kosovo Serbs was disappointing. The Council had stressed the importance of the early formation of a functioning Government, fully committed to the Standards implementation which will be reviewed in mid-2005. Kosovo has established a new coalition government which received approval by the Parliament. The EU will look to the newly elected and now established bodies of the Provisional Institutions for Self-Government (PISG) for the effective implementation of the Kosovo Standards and full co-operation with the SRSG and other representatives of the international community.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of Kosovo, the Council, in the context of the Assembly elections, reiterated its commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo, ensuring full protection of minorities, contributing to the stability of the region and consistent with EU values and standards. The UN Security Council Resolution 1244 remains the basis of the international community's engagement in Kosovo and the lead and overall responsibility in Kosovo lies with the UN. The EU continues to fully support the efforts of the SRSG for the implementation of UNSC1244. It is clear that people of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo will have their place in Europe and that the EU will be called upon to assume an increasingly greater role. The EU, therefore, intends to continue being actively engaged in the international debate about the future of Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0453"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council informs the Honourable Parliamentarian that the implications of the current demographic trends for future economic and social policy goals are one of the issues being addressed by the Member States and the Council, and that the matter has recently been discussed during the European Council of 4/5 November in the context of the preparation of the Lisbon Strategy mid-term review. The European Council not only confirmed the validity and relevance of the Lisbon process, which identified the demographic challenge in the context of the EU medium term policy approach for economic growth and social cohesion, but also stressed the importance of the Mid-Term Review to be undertaken at the Spring European Council in 2005. In particular, the European Council took note of the letter of the Heads of State or Government of France, Germany, Spain and Sweden pointing out the importance of demographic factors in shaping the future economic and social development of Europe and calling for the elaboration of a “European Pact for Youth”.</p>
<p>This matter was also discussed later by the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) on 7 December in the context of a policy debate on a new Social Policy Agenda from 2006 – 2010, on the basis of a Dutch Presidency's note based on the outcome of a series of events and conferences, in particular, the closing conference, “Social Policy in Europe: let’s deliver” held in Rotterdam on 8/9 November. The Presidency paper identifies six priority areas, or building blocks, for future action in the new Social Policy Agenda, which were broadly supported by all delegations. Member States are invited to develop comprehensive active ageing strategies by 2006, aiming at a radical policy and cultural shift away from early retirement towards longer working lives, and aiming at the participation of all. The Presidency also identified the need to activate Europe’s unused labour potential and the need for greater efforts by governments, social partners and individual employers and employees to achieve better possibilities for the reconciliation of work and family life.</p>
<p>In this context, the initiative for a European Youth Pact suggested by the French, German, Spanish and Swedish governments, was particularly welcomed, and the need to reconcile professional and family life stressed, as better care facilities and infrastructures for children and the elderly would improve participation in economic life.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0462"></a>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is certainly aware, in the field of social security each Member State remains responsible for its own social security legislation including the benefits provided, the conditions for eligibility and the value of these benefits. However, Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 provides for Community provisions for the co-ordination of these systems. Such coordination ensures that migrant workers and members of their families do not lose their social security protection when moving within the Community.</p>
<p>A major principle of Reg. 1408/71 is that a person shall be subject to the legislation of only one Member State. In this respect, the Regulation provides for the application of the legislation of the Member State where the person is employed. A seaman employed on a vessel is subject to the legislation of the Member State whose flag the vessel is flying. Furthermore, Reg. 1408/71 requires that the basic principles of equality of treatment and non-discrimination are respected. Consequently, a seaman resident in one Member State but employed on board of a vessel sailing under the flag of another Member State is subject to the legislation and will be entitled to social security coverage of this latter on the same footing of any of its nationals employed on board of the same vessel.</p>
<p>Article 17 of this Regulation provides for the possibility to derogate from the principle of lex loci laboris as two Member States may conclude a bilateral agreement in situations where the standard rule may create - as pointed out by the ECJ in the Brusse judgment (case C-101/83) - administrative complications for workers, as well as for employers and social security authorities, thus creating obstacles to the freedom of movement for workers. However, it must be stressed that such agreements, which can be concluded for certain persons or categories of persons, must be in the interests of these persons.</p>
<p>In this context, it is for the Member States to ensure that any bilateral agreements derogating to the lex loci laboris principle are in the interest of the worker, such decisions being obviously open to challenge before the European Court of Justice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0477"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has continuously followed the situation of the European Textiles and Clothing industry over the last years as it developed in the wake of the dismantling of quotas for the imports of Textiles and Clothing products from WTO Members.</p>
<p>The establishment and the expiry of the ATC (Agreement on Textiles and Clothing) are part and parcel of the results of the Uruguay Round, concluded in 1994. Since then, it was clear that "as from 1 January 2005, the textiles and clothing sector shall be fully integrated into GATT 1994" (ATC, Article 9).</p>
<p>China is a member of the WTO since 2001, and as such has benefited from the last step of liberalisation, the so-called third stage, and will fully share the benefits of the abolition of quotas. Nevertheless, at the moment of accession of China to the WTO, a protocol was agreed as well. Under this protocol, a specific safeguard for textiles can be activated until 31 December 2008.</p>
<p>It is before this background among others that the Council has quite recently again discussed the situation of the European Textiles and Clothing industry and has adopted, on 25/26 November 2004, a set of conclusions on this subject, in which, inter alia:</p>
<p>it stresses the important role of SMEs in the textile sector. There is a need to improve access of these enterprises to finance by using Community financial instruments to provide European leverage and support for SME financing, including their access to support for research and innovation;</p>
<p>it invites the Commission to regularly inform the Council on the developments in the EU textiles and clothing sector in the aftermath of the dismantling of import quotas from 1 January 2005 and in the light of the implementation of the proposed initiatives; it also invites the Commission to report on the outcome of the further discussions of the High Level Group; and</p>
<p>notes the Commission's readiness to use the available trade defence instruments, if the legal conditions are met and if and when they are effectively needed.</p>
<p>The Council on 13/14 December 2004 has adopted a regulation adopting EU provisions on imports of certain textile products in order to take account of the WTO Agreement and Clothing expiry on 31 December 2004. Among others, the new rules foresee:</p>
<p>the introduction of a time limited ex ante monitoring system for certain imports from China and a customs-based ex post monitoring system for certain imports;</p>
<p>an end-of-year shipment regime for products shipped before the expiry of the ATC but released for free circulation in the Community after that date.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council, in response to the question of the Honourable Parliamentarian which addresses the guarantees for the respect for fundamental rights in relation to the application of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), intends to stress that fundamental rights were very much in focus when the Framework Decision was negotiated in the Council, and building on preexisting national experiences with extradition, found expression in the final agreed text.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Framework Decision is based on the principle of mutual recognition, which involves a high degree of trust between the EU Member States, based on their common sharing of democratic values and on their participation to the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the 1950 Convention and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to Member States, are general principles of Community law. These principles have been reflected notably in Article 1(3) of the Framework Decision, which provides that the Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the TEU. Recital 12 of the Framework Decision also addresses the issue of fundamental rights, specifying for example, that the Framework Decision does not prevent a Member States from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media. The same care not to hamper the full respect for and exercise of fundamental rights was also very much in the focus when negotiating the grounds for refusing to execute an arrest warrant. Difficulties concerning human rights in the practical application of the Framework Decision have not been reported.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0484"></a>

The new challenges call for investment, and only an integrated approach to research and innovation can succeed. A bottom-up approach is one of the main preconditions for involving the public more in decision-making. Not only parliaments and the whole range of civil society but, in particular, towns and regions too must be involved in the Lisbon Process. Various federal states and the Netherlands too encourage regions to exploit economic potential and invest in regional economic strengths. In addition, in the forthcoming period it is advocated that funds be deployed more flexibly because the transition to an intensive knowledge-based economy requires efforts to bring about innovation with regard to markets and products. The Kok Report primarily stresses national action plans.

<p>(EN) The Council would inform the Honourable Member that, in response to the ways in which the European Union has developed since the Maastricht Treaty, resulting in a wider range of activities, in extension and strengthening of the role of the Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP and in an unprecedented increase in the number of Member States, the Council has embarked upon an ongoing adjustment and modernisation process, so as to be efficient and flexible enough to discharge its new tasks and responsibilities.</p>
<p>In doing so, the Council has come up against a number of administrative, technical, budgetary and even staffing constraints, with the entry into force of the new Staff Regulations on 1 May 2004, not to mention the institutional constraints imposed by successive amendments to the Treaties over that time. Such constraints, set to continue for the years ahead, have nevertheless marked out this six-month term as one of transition, which in any case makes it particularly difficult, premature though this be at present, to assess the results achieved. The Presidency can, however, already be seen to have made extensive use of the resources available to it, in all areas of EU action, in order to conduct Council business as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Institutionally speaking, the Council would remind the Honourable Member that, following the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 December 2004, the Presidency will be reporting to the European Parliament on the results of its six-month term, on 21 December 2004, before the Conference of Presidents of political groups, meeting in open session. To do so before then would be jumping the gun.</p>
<p>As regards the pension scheme for EU officials, on 22 March 2004 the Council adopted Regulation No 723/2004 (OJ L 124, 27.4.2004) amending the Staff Regulations of officials and other staff of the European Communities. The 28th, 29th and 30th recitals in that Regulation set out very clearly the reasons for a thorough overhaul of the Staff Regulations, particularly on pensions. Given the recent agreement on the Statute in March 2004, further reform in this area was not as such on the agenda of the Dutch Presidency.</p>
<p>With more specific regard to the scheme's actuarial balance, the Commission has recently, on 3 November 2004, proposed adjusting the level of contributions from officials and other staff, which will rise from 9,25% to 9,75%, with retroactive effect from 1 July 2004, in accordance with Article 83a(3) of the Staff Regulations and the implementing rules laid down in Annex XII to them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0494"></a>

<p>To date, the policy of regulation has resulted in restrictions on the production of sugar. For example sugar mills in Poland have not been allocated the full production quotas they require to meet the needs of the national market. At the same time, the price of sugar has risen by 64%. It is generally believed that this policy favours neither technological progress within the industry nor the industry's competitiveness on EU and world markets. It raises living costs for the poorest sectors of society and also social costs, and, in the long term, generates a whole system of refunds subsidised by the EU, and protectionism. This situation is unhealthy. We are trying to compete in the export field on the basis of refunds instead of profitable production, which requires technological modernisation and improved organisation.

<p>(FR) As early as October 2003, the Council launched a debate on the reform of the CMO for sugar based on the communication which the Commission had forwarded to it on 23 September 2003, with the intention in particular of opening discussion on the objectives of the Community scheme for sugar in the context of the new CAP on the basis of the information contained in the in-depth evaluation of the impact on the European sugar sector and an analysis of the various reform options.</p>
<p>The Council continued this debate when examining the Commission communication accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP - sugar sector reform, presented on 15 July 2004. During the policy debate held at the Agriculture/Fisheries Council on 22 November 2004, all Member State delegations agreed on the need to reform the sugar sector but were divided as to the extent of such reform and the approach underlying the Commission communication. The very question of whether or not such a reform was advisable was raised, as postponing it until after 2006 might, where necessary, make it possible to take account of uncertainties at international level (position of the ACP countries, that of the LDCs in the context of the Everything But Arms initiative, outcome of the WTO Panel and the Doha Round).</p>
<p>The Council will have occasion to continue these discussions when the Commission presents its legislative proposal during the first half of next year. It is therefore too early at this stage to prejudge the outcome of proceedings and discussions that will be conducted in the Council in due course.</p>
<p>However, the Council will not fail to pay particular attention to the economic and social impact of reform. The Council, together with the Commission, and after consideration of the European Parliament's opinion under the consultation procedure, will make every effort to find a solution striking a balance between the different interests at stake.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0495"></a>

<p>The Cotonou Agreement is due to be revised at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005. The Commission is proposing to incorporate a specific reference to the Millennium Objectives declaration into partnership agreements with the ACP countries. However, the proposal is not clear on this point, whereas on the subject of action to combat terrorism and weapons of mass destruction the proposed clauses are already highly advanced and they would thus appear to have priority status. Experience has shown that the European Union has not succeeded in implementing its political discourse on the Millennium Objectives, which are not reflected either in the EU's political development priorities or in the budget allocated thereto.</p>
<p>How is the Commission planning to incorporate the Millennium Objectives into the Cotonou Agreement? How does it intend to measure the EU's efforts to achieve those objectives and at the same time to increase its partner countries' ability to do so as well? What proportion of the budget is it planning to allocate and how will it assess the impact of such aid?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Negotiators for both sides soon agreed that a reference to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be added to the preamble to the Cotonou Agreement. This was not a controversial issue; it involved the replacement and extension of the goal of reducing poverty referred to in the current version of the Cotonou Agreement. This revision must be seen as a simple update, adapting the Cotonou Agreement to the MDG process.</p>
<p>The Cotonou Agreement is not best suited to discussion of the ways in which specific commitments to MDGs may be implemented in cooperation with ACP countries. Being a multiannual legal framework, the Cotonou Agreement sets out general parameters for cooperation, and these are in perfect conformity with the Millennium Goals, but specific action is taken, and specific commitments made, in the context of the strategy documents for countries and regions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that potential additional commitments by donors to the achievement of the Millennium Goals will be discussed over the next nine months as part of the preparations for the high level event on the follow-up to the Millennium Summit to be held in New York next September. In this context, the Commission has proposed that new potential action by the EU be concentrated in three areas : (1) funding, (2) the consistency of policies, and (3) Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0452"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission wishes to observe that it is, through ECHO, its humanitarian aid service, the principal donor of humanitarian aid for the victims of the crisis brought on by the second Chechen conflict. Since the beginning of this conflict in the autumn of 1999, ECHO has supplied almost EUR 146 million in aid through non-governmental organisations, United Nations agencies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>This aid is widely recognised as being effective and appropriate. All the humanitarian actors involved have hailed the leading role played by ECHO in meeting the urgent humanitarian needs of the victims of this crisis, which, unfortunately, tends to be forgotten by other humanitarian donors.</p>
<p>ECHO funds the distribution of basic and supplementary food aid to some 300 000 persons, which is an essential resource for vulnerable families, especially in the most remote areas of Chechnya. ECHO also funds the provision, using tankers, of drinking water to the inhabitants of Grozny and the operation of pumping stations. ECHO is also very active in the medical field, providing equipment, medicines and training to the main hospitals, in which it funds basic rehabilitation schemes. ECHO also funds, inter alia, the distribution of non-food products (children’s clothing, mattresses, etc.) and gives active support to programmes of primary education and psychosocial support for children, as well as vocational training programmes for school-leavers.</p>
<p>It is no easy task to supply humanitarian aid to Chechnya, which is one of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world, where humanitarian organisations work under conditions which are among the worst anywhere in terms not only of safety but also of monitoring. The hazards faced by humanitarian personnel – including being attacked, threatened, harassed and, in particular, abducted – are such that it is not possible for foreigners to be based in Chechnya itself. Operations are therefore carried out using a remote control system, with workers in Chechnya recruited locally and foreign staff visiting the interior of the republic as often as possible. In addition to this, consideration must also be given to the recurrent issue of how humanitarian organisations can gain access to Chechnya and to those they seek to help. The authorities are still restricting NGOs’ free access by requiring permits and other burdensome and random bureaucratic procedures; they also still refuse to allow humanitarian organisations to have access to VHF radios. It is for this reason that the Commission, whenever it meets with the Russian authorities, continues – albeit so far in vain – to raise this issue and to demand of them a less obstructive attitude.</p>
<p>ECHO supplies aid not only to people in Chechnya, but also to displaced persons living in Ingushetia and Daghestan. All the tent camps having been closed down, ECHO continues to give help to refugees living in makeshift conditions or in private homes. Together with its partners, such as the HCR and the ICRC, ECHO also ensures that these people are protected, thus enabling them to stay where they are and preventing their involuntary or enforced return.</p>
<p>Finally, ECHO has announced its willingness to meet any other need which might arise from new developments in the Northern Caucasus, such as in the immediate aftermath of the recent spread of the conflict to other republics and the tragic hostage-taking in Beslan.</p>
<p>At the EU-Russia summit in The Hague, the Commission again made Russia the offer of examining how, in addition to ECHO’s humanitarian aid, it might play a part in the restoration and reconstruction of Chechnya as soon as security was guaranteed. The first stage would involve the organisation of a mission to assess needs in the Northern Caucasus, and the Commission hopes to get this up and running soon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0465"></a>

<p>(FR) Following appeals by the FAO and from countries affected by the massive invasion of locusts, the Commission has decided to support the fight against this plague to the tune of EUR 23.5 million provided by the European Development Fund, with the addition of EUR 2 million in the form of Budget lines for food safety. These sums, on top of aid granted directly to the states concerned, have made it possible, since the beginning of 2004, for some EUR 50 million to be raised for the fight against locusts in the countries of the Sahel.</p>
<p>The funding allocated to the FAO was intended to support various projects, including the purchase of pesticides and the identification and treatment of contaminated areas. Treatment with pesticide sprays continued up to the beginning of December. The countries of the Sahel are under less pressure given the onset of colder weather and the ascent of swarms in line with their natural migratory cycle.</p>
<p>Although good rainfall in most of the affected areas allowed the locusts to reproduce rapidly, it also proved beneficial to agricultural production and helped make good some of the losses. That having been said, the locusts have done considerable damage in some areas of the countries affected, particularly in Mauritania and its neighbours, endangering the security of the inhabitants’ food supplies.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to monitor the progress of the situation.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission would begin by recalling that, since 1996, when the HIPC was launched, it has been (and still is) deeply involved in the international initiative to reduce the debt burden affecting the heavily indebted poor countries. To date, the Community has contributed more than EUR 1.6 billion to that initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission has also participated in additional initiatives with a view to adapting its activities so as to take better account of the specific needs of individual poor countries. As well as being involved in the HIPC Initiative, it has cancelled all repayments of the special loans granted to the least developed countries from the European Development Fund (EDF). It has also assisted specific countries, such the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the Republic of the Congo, which were seriously in arrears with their repayments to international institutions, to regularise their financial situation. That has enabled them to secure total access to the HIPC Initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the recent decision to extend the international initiative until 2006, since that will enable more countries to secure access thereto. It can also confirm that it is continuing its cooperation with the relevant international financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Commission is also seeking to act in accordance with a forward-looking, innovatory approach. To that end, it is giving special consideration to the situation of individual countries emerging from hostilities which are currently not in a position to qualify for aid. Together with the international community, the Commission is helping in the search for solutions appropriate to the specific problems faced by those countries.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is following with interest the establishment by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund of a debt-sustainability mechanism for low-revenue countries. That mechanism, when fully up and running, will enable poor countries to avoid falling back into a situation where they are excessively indebted, since loans will be replaced by gifts.</p>
<p>To that end, the Commission is endeavouring to secure, in a transparent and independent manner, the participation of governments, of civil society and of all partners in the development process with a view to devising the practical details of that mechanism.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0412"></a>

<p>(EN) At the end of 1994, the Essen European Council defined a Pre-Accession Strategy to prepare the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for EU membership. Pre-accession instruments have been and are being financed by the European Community to assist the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe with their pre-accession preparations. The Commission supports promotion of social inclusion and social protection in Bulgaria notably through Phare (reference document: Phare regulation 3906/89). As part of the pre-accession strategy, Bulgaria also participates in some Community programmes related to social inclusion and social protection.</p>
<p>Phare programmes and their financing are decided on the basis of Financing Memoranda agreed between the Commission and the authorities of each candidate country. They provide the legal basis for programme implementation and are accompanied by project fiches that list the detailed projects. Documents such as Road Maps and Accession Partnerships set the framework for each Candidate Country, establishing the overall priorities the country must address to prepare for accession and the resources available to help them do so.</p>
<p>Regarding social inclusion, the Commission and Bulgaria are finalising the Joint Memorandum on Social Inclusion (JIM) to identify key challenges and relevant policy responses to promote social inclusion. The JIM will represent an important step to prepare Bulgaria for the open method of coordination in the area of social inclusion.</p>
<p>Also in the area of social protection, there are no legal obligations to implement precise policy measures but a very important general obligation to co-ordinate the respective policies in order to develop a homogenous social framework in line with the principle and rules of the EU Treaty. For the EU an evolving co-operation to promote an effective system of social protection is an important component of the wider employment and social situation in the EU. While the organisation of social protection systems remain the responsibility of individual Member States, the EU requires that these systems have the capacity to develop and operate sustainable and universally applicable social protection systems in line with the Treaty objectives. The systems of the candidate countries, including Bulgaria, must also be capable of co-ordinating with those systems currently operating in the EU which are themselves developing in a very dynamic way and undergoing significant reform. In June 2004 a seminar has taken place in Sofia between the Commission, the Bulgarian authorities and stakeholders in order to prepare Bulgaria for the participation in the Open method of coordination in the field of pensions, a joint effort to promote reforms in the Member States that will guarantee both the future adequacy and financial sustainability of pension systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0415"></a>

<p>(EN) The “raison d’être” of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) is to help the ACP countries to deal with the challenges of globalisation by developing strong regional economies. The Commission has therefore emphasised the need to place market opening in the context of national, regional and international policies. The EPA approach aims at developing regional markets with a common set of border measures, tariff and non-tariff, as an incentive for more local economic activity. Only in a second phase will a regional access for EU goods or services be discussed that will be consistent with the needs and constraints of ACP economies. Therefore such access does not need to match that offered by the EU neither in terms of product coverage nor of the calendar for tariff dismantlement. In other words, ACP may negotiate a slower liberalisation and even permanently exclude sensitive products. Current WTO rules provide sufficient flexibility for this asymmetric approach. Moreover EPAs will be accompanied by appropriate development support measures to help ACP business operators seize the opportunities provided by market opening (both in the EC and at the regional and international level). Therefore, while EPAs themselves will be mainly trade agreements, what could be called the “EPA process” will be broader and cover issues linked to development policy and support within the Cotonou framework.</p>
<p>Market opening of ACP regions toward the EU will be flexible and asymmetric. ACP countries can protect all sensitive sectors during a transition period that will be negotiated. Even beyond this timeframe, a substantial part of ACP imports could still be protected under safeguard provisions. In the EC view, this should be more than sufficient to cover for example infant industries and sensitive agricultural products. The alternative – lasting and indiscriminate protectionism – would only lead to further marginalisation and provide benefits for a few while incurring high costs for most in the developing countries concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0417"></a>

Such zones may or may not coincide with Euroregions. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, it is for the Member States to decide whether those Euroregions that exist within the zones covered by Interreg III A programmes are to be involved in the implementation of these programmes.</p>
<p>Certain Euroregions function as managing or paying authorities or as the Joint Technical Secretariats of Interreg III A programmes. Others manage sub-programmes or measures under an Interreg III A programme or function simply as information points. Lastly, others carry out the evaluation of projects.</p>
<p>In this context, the new Pyrenees/Mediterranean Euroregion might, if need be, be involved in the implementation of such trans-European projects or programmes as the Spain/France Interreg III A programme or, indeed, other Interreg III programmes regarded as relevant to the region.</p>
<p>In its proposals for the forthcoming programming period, which will run from 2007 to 2013, the Commission continues to treat the principles of partnership and subsidiarity as essential. Member States, regions and local authorities will play an essential part in defining strategic programming priorities and will exercise greater responsibility as regards the management, monitoring and evaluation of projects part-funded by the Structural Funds. This process of greater decentralisation will involve strict adherence to the political and administrative structures of each Member State.</p>
<p>With more specific regard to cross-border cooperation, the Commission has proposed the creation of a new goal for intervention by the Structural Funds, termed ‘European Territorial Cooperation’, which is intended to give fresh impetus to cooperation across borders and between nations and regions. The Commission has also proposed the creation of an instrument facilitating the establishment, on Community territory, of cooperation groups with legal personality. Use of these groups would be optional and would make it possible to delegate specific tasks and powers relating to the implementation of cross-border cooperation programmes part-funded by the Community, such as those under the Structural Funds, and also to carry out cross-border cooperation operations initiated by Member States and their regions and local authorities, without any financial involvement on the part of the Community.</p>
<p>The establishment of these groups will have no effect on regional and local authorities’ financial responsibilities, nor on those of the Member States, in relation to the management of Community or national funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0423"></a>

<p>According to this analysis, the option proposed in the communication of 2004, 'Accomplishing a sustainable model for Europe through the reformed CAP - sugar sector reform', will require certain adjustments in the sugar sector in developing countries. The Commission has therefore undertaken to launch a structured dialogue with the ACP countries which are signatories to the sugar protocol, on the basis of an action plan to be drawn up by the Commission, with suitable flanking measures relating to trade and development.

<p>(FR) It is apparent from the various analyses carried out by the Commission since 2003 that there is an urgent need for in-depth reform of the sugar sector. It is also generally agreed that the likelihood of increased imports and hence of structural surpluses within the EU means that it is not possible to maintain the support system in its present form. The sector needs to be reformed as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>To be sure, negotiations currently in progress within the World Trade Organisation give rise to significant uncertainties about the sector’s future, and it would also appear opportune to await the final outcome of the sugar panel which is currently preparing proposals for regulations to be submitted to the Council and to Parliament. Moreover, the Commission has proposed for 2008 a re-examination of the price levels and quotas set out in its proposal for reform, in order to take into account those changes that will have been observed by then.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0491"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU’s first aim is to contribute to a high level of health protection and social cohesion by complementing the Member States’ action in preventing and reducing drug use, dependence, and drug-related harm to health and society. The EU aims also to ensure a high level of security for the general public by taking action against drugs production, cross-border trafficking in drugs and diversion of precursors, and by intensifying preventive action against drug-related crime through effective cooperation embedded in a joint approach.</p>
<p>A Eurobarometer opinion poll carried out in 2002 and 2004 at the Commission’s request on young people (15 to 24 years) in fifteen countries of the European Union, indicates an increase in the facility of obtaining drugs (in particular, in recreational settings) and a small increase in the early consumption of cannabis (29 % in 2002 and 33% in 2004), but a stabilization in the pattern of drug abuse of other substances.</p>
<p>On the basis of the results of the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Action Plan 2000-2004, the Commission will bring forward a Communication on a new EU Drugs Action Plan (2005-2008) early in 2005. The new Action Plan will set out specific interventions and actions to be carried out by the Member States, the Commission, the EMCDDA and EUROPOL. It will cover demand reduction, supply reduction, coordination, information, evaluation and research, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission Communication on coordination on drugs in the European Union<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted last year stresses that isolated national responses will not suffice in tackling the drugs phenomenon and its impact on collective and individual health and safety. Given that this is a complex, multifaceted problem involving a large number of actors, effective coordination of all involved is necessary. Coordination both within and between EU institutions and the Member States must be improved in order to respond adequately to the social, economic, security-related and health-related problems posed by drug consumption.</p>
<p>One of the key points in any policy is the cost-effectiveness ratio. But it is very difficult to count the expenditure in drugs-related matters. There is no precise definition of what is included, and there are many different types of drug-related expenditure on aspects such as prevention, rehabilitation and health-care, measures against trafficking, organised crime, etc. Expenditure on drugs issues is almost entirely embedded in programmes and budget lines that cover a multitude of subjects and geographical areas. Much of the funding is allocated under different or indirect headings (e.g. the Public Health Programme, Research and Development programme, regional development, the AGIS Programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters etc.).</p>
<p>Reinforcement of coordination within Member States and in the EU could help to produce an estimate at national and European level of public drug-related expenditure, to measure the impact of the initiatives that are taken, and to give the public a clear view of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU's aspiration to transform itself into the most competitive economy in the world (Lisbon Agenda) calls for a significant increase in funding for European research policy. Research spending is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitutes investment in its survival in a fiercely competitive international environment. However, the declared intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact (SDP), which prohibits Member States' public expenditure from overshooting a budget deficit of 3% of GDP.</p>
<p>If the Member States are to have an incentive to set aside 1% of GDP for public funding of research policy, that percentage should not be included in calculating the ceiling of 3% of GDP laid down by the SDP. Does the Commission agree that public spending on research constitutes top priority strategic expenditure for the EU and, as such, can justifiably be excluded from the criteria under the Pact? The argument that such a decision will pave the way for a host of other exceptions (e.g. military spending) is not tenable since the strengthening of research is an established European strategic goal which has no analogy with any other national or European objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Enhancing the contribution of fiscal policy to long-term growth is a priority both in the EU fiscal framework and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs). In this respect, a comprehensive survey by the Commission in the report ‘Public Finances in EMU 2004’ shows that fiscal policy can make its best contribution to growth by (i) avoiding protracted budget deficits and (ii) by redirecting public expenditure towards growth-enhancing items.</p>
<p>In the context of the latter debate there have been calls to exclude public investment (a so-called golden rule), Research and Development (R&amp;D), education, health care and defence from the deficit reference value as specified in the EU Treaty. The Commission, however, considers that a golden rule for investment, or the exclusion of other expenditure items from the deficit calculation, would be inappropriate. First, leaving certain categories of expenditure out of the definition of deficits would, de facto, raise the 3%-deficit ceiling, thus leading to more public debt and higher interest rates in the long run. Sustainability would be more difficult to reach and the objectives of the EU fiscal framework - including its contribution to long-term growth - may be jeopardized. Second, it could be hard to achieve consensus of which expenditures should be left out from the definition of deficits, given that Member States may have very different expenditure needs and given large uncertainties in empirical estimates of growth-enhancing impact. Third, excluding particular items such as public investment or R&amp;D may create an incentive to reclassify public expenditure into those items and does not guarantee that all expenditure labelled as such is growth-enhancing; the wrong investment may be favoured. Finally, from a legal viewpoint, re-defining the concept of deficits to be used in the EU fiscal framework may involve a very complex procedure, since it may require changing either the Treaty Protocol (where the reference value for budget deficits is defined) or the system of national accounts (ESA95).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0449"></a>

<p>On 18 November 2004, the Commission received a WTO report which states that European designations of origin (DOs) can coexist with trademarks of products made in countries outside the Community and marketed under names which are the same as or similar to those of European DOs. If this were to be the case, many European products – such as sherry from Jerez or wine from Malaga, for example – would suffer as a result of unfair competition from copycat products that would not only adversely affect the European market, but would also mean a loss of selling power for genuine products which are popular precisely because they are traditionally made in certain places.</p>
<p>Could the Commission look into what the WTO report says about DOs? What is the Commission’s position on the dispute within the WTO between the EU and countries such as Australia and the US?

<p>(EN) On 16 November 2004, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel issued its interim reports in a dispute brought by the United States and Australia against EC Regulation 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications (GI) and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining the interim reports, but as they are confidential under WTO rules, it is not possible to comment on their content.</p>
<p>All parties to the dispute have made comments to the panel on the interim reports and the panel is scheduled to issue the final reports confidentially to the parties on 21 December 2004.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to answer to questions from the Member of the European Parliament once the final reports have been made public, which it is expected to be at the beginning of 2005.</p>
<p>It needs to be recalled that, following incorrect media reports based on leaks, the Commission press services rectified certain elements in order to provide a correct information to the public.</p>
<p>The interim panel reports largely vindicate the EC’s view that the system of GI protection is compatible with WTO rules.</p>
<p>Two key issues were at stake.</p>
<p>First, the US and Australia argued that the EC GI regime discriminates contrary to WTO rules, because it allows registration of GIs relating to areas outside the EU only under certain conditions (notably the conditions of reciprocity and equivalence) which do not apply to registration of GIs relating to areas inside the EC. Throughout this dispute, the EC has made clear that Regulation 2081/92 does not require the condition of reciprocity and equivalence for the protection of geographical indications originating in WTO members. The EU has also repeatedly stated that it would welcome applications for registration in the EC for foreign GIs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the complainants had challenged the EC discipline on the relationship between GI rights and prior trademark rights. The EC has always considered that the coexistence of GIs with prior trademarks as provided for by the Regulation is in conformity with WTO rules.</p>
<p>Despite what could be considered an attempt by the United States and Australia to use the dispute settlement system to divert attention from the need to enhance protection for geographical indications through negotiations, the EC will continue to pursue in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) an agenda for the establishment of a multilateral register for wines and spirits, extended protection to other products and the end of current usurpation of GI names in third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0450"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. The letter of 21 September 2004 sent to the Commission by ‘Women on Waves’ on the refusal of the Portuguese authorities to permit the Women on Waves ship, the Borndiep, to enter Portuguese territorial waters has been registered as a complaint by the Commission. A first reply on substance was sent to the complainant on 10 November 2004.</p>
<p>As announced by the Commission to the Parliament in its plenary session of 16 September 2004 in Strasbourg, during an oral debate on two parliamentary questions on this incident, a letter was sent to the Portuguese authorities on 14 October 2004 to request further information and their reply has been received on 23 November 2004.</p>
<p>2. The Commission recalls that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10 December 1982 and in particular Articles 17, 18 and 19 any party to this Convention is entitled to require that a vessel entering its waters limits itself to exercise its right of innocent passage as defined in Articles 18 and 19. According to Article 19 of this Convention, passage by a foreign ship is not considered “innocent” if such ship engages in any activity not having a direct bearing on passage (Art.19(2)(l)). Having said that, it should be emphasised that, even though the European Community is a party to the UNCLOS convention, the matter involved in the present case (measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction over vessels) falls within those which are left to the competence of the Member States in their quality of parties to the same Convention. In this context, therefore, the Commission would not be entitled to intervene. Any action for alleged violations of the Convention were to be brought before the Portuguese law-courts and would be submitted to the rules and conditions provided for under Portuguese law.</p>
<p>In relation to the alleged violation of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 and in particular of Article 19.2 on freedom of expression, Article 21 on the right to peaceful assembly and Article 22 on the right of freedom of association thereof, the Commission is not in a position to make an assessment on this point. It falls to international bodies charged with monitoring compliance with international human rights instruments - such as that established by the Covenant - to assess the lawfulness of action carried out by States with respect to such instruments. The same reasoning applies to the alleged violation of international documents concerning reproductive health that have been signed by Portugal.</p>
<p>3. In the letter to the Portuguese authorities the Commission recalled the principles of Community law in connection with free movement of persons. In particular it indicated that Member States can restrict this fundamental right solely where it is justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health and that where a Member State adopts a measure refusing entry to its territory based on one of these grounds, it must respect the general principles of Community law and in particular the proportionality principle, and fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of information and expression. Member States must also respect the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, referred to by the Honourable Member replaces, among other texts, Directive 62/221. However, Member States have until 30 April 2006 to transpose it into national law. In any event this new Directive does not change Directive 64/221 substantially.</p>
<p>4. The Portuguese authorities have justified their decision on the UNCLOS and on the need to protect public health, safeguard the legal order and prevent abuse of rights. They esteem that the decision was not contrary to Community law on free movement of persons since the members of Women on Waves were allowed to go ashore and Portuguese citizens were permitted access to the vessel. They put forward that if it were to be considered as a restriction of free movement it would still be justified on grounds of public policy and proportionate.</p>
<p>5. On the basis of the above and of the Portuguese authorities reply, the Commission will decide on the follow-up to this official complaint in its next meeting on infringements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Parliament endorsed this Communication in its Resolution of 4 December 2003. Furthermore, the commitment of Member States is evident from the explicit inclusion of organised crime and corruption in the Den Haag Programme, agreed at the European Council of 4-5 November 2004.</p>

Work to develop a viable option, whether in the form of a separate EU mechanism, participation in the Council of Europe Group of Countries against Corruption (GRECO) mechanism, or a mechanism to evaluate and monitor both EU instruments and the UN Convention against Corruption, is continuing. In the meantime, the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International, a leading non governmental organisation in this field, is a useful reference point, as are the evaluation reports published by the Council of Europe’s GRECO Group, as part of its monitoring process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission first would like to recall that neither the Europol Convention nor the Council Act of 19<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2002 amending the Europol Staff regulations foresee any specific role for the Commission in the process of designation of the Europol’s director. This is in the hands of the Europol Management Board where the Commission sits as an observer and in the ones of the JAI Council where the decision has to be taken under unanimity.</p>
<p>After its failure, during the first half of 2004 to agree unanimously on one candidate, the JAI Council of 19<span class="sup">th</span> July 2004 has tasked the Management Board of Europol to submit a new opinion to the Council. On the 6<span class="sup">th</span> of August the Management Board, through a written procedure, decided to relaunch a new selection procedure. As prescribed in Article 4 (1) of Council Act of 19 December 2002 amending the Staff Regulations applicable to Europol Employees, the advertisement for this post has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU 2004/C 210 A/1 of 20<span class="sup">th</span> August 2004) and in other media, including national newspapers and specialised periodicals, to ensure maximum exposure in all the Member States. The deadline for applications was 18<span class="sup">th</span> of October (60 days after the publication in the OJEU,as foreseen in the Council Act of 19<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2002). The selection committee was set up by the Management Board during its meeting of mid September. A short list of candidates has been prepared by this selection committee that will be submitted to the Management Board in its meeting of 14<span class="sup">th</span> and 15<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2004. If an agreement is reached there among the members of the Management Board of Europol on a proposal to be made to the Council, a decision could be made by the nearest JAI Council. The Commission considers that this new selection procedure has been organized in the shortest delays that the legal provisions allow.</p>
<p>It has to be mentioned nevertheless that after the departure of M. Jürgen Storbeck, on the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of July 2004, the direction of Europol has been assumed by one of the three deputy directors, M.

<p>(EN) On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the incident, when in December last year a vessel lost dangerous cargoes off the Dutch coast, would not appear to have been due to inadequate safety standards of the vessel itself.</p>
<p>The Commission, through the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC Euratom, has been regularly informed by the Dutch authorities on the consequences of the accident, which happened under bad weather conditions.</p>
<p>The stowing of goods, as part of the transport operation of dangerous goods by sea, falls under international rules of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) of the International maritime Organisation (IMO) to which Member States, but not the European Community, are signatories. Equally, the European Community has not incorporated the IMDG Code into the body of Community legislation, although this is not being excluded at some future point.</p>
<p>In view of the above, national rules, based or not on the IMDG Code, apply to the transport of dangerous goods by sea.</p>
<p>Moreover, the monitoring of vessels carrying dangerous substances is covered by Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system which entered into force in February 2004. This text reinforces the obligation for the vessels carrying dangerous goods to report to the competent authorities and foresees the creation of a network for data exchange between the maritime administrations of the Member States.</p>
<p>This network, the so-called SafeSeaNet system, has been developed by the Commission and is now under the responsibility of the European Maritime Safety Agency for its operational implementation. In the case of the vessel Andinet, the European Safety Agency did not signal any problem or dangerous situation as foreseen in the EU legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0468"></a>

<p>Recent scientific evidence (BirdLife International, 2004 Birds in the European Union: a status assessment) shows that populations of farmland birds such as skylarks and lapwings have significantly declined in recent decades. How does the Commission propose to ensure that the objectives of the Birds Directive 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> are fully integrated into other policies, in particular the CAP, in order to reverse such decline?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the new report of BirdLife International on the status of birds in the EU, having financially supported its production. This latest scientific information has been the subject of detailed discussions at the recent conference on 25 years of the Birds Directive<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which took place in Bergen-op-Zoom, the Netherlands, in November 2004. The conclusions of this conference highlight the need for further integration of bird conservation concerns into the implementation of EU common policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p>
<p>The Commission has already been working with the Member States and stakeholders on finding better and more effective ways to achieve this objective. In this regard, the introduction of cross-compliance in the 1999 CAP reform followed by its strengthening in the 2003 reform as environmental protection requirements with regard to the market pillar of the CAP, has provided increasing possibilities for Member States to link support payments to the respect of the environment. Cross-compliance has been made a central and obligatory part of the direct support system in the 2003 CAP reform to apply from 2005. The Birds and Habitats<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Directives are among the legislation to be respected by farmers in receipt of such support. Cross compliance also includes the requirement to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition which, if fully used by Member States whose responsibility it is to define this in practice, should also contribute to reversing the decline in farmland birds.</p>
<p>In addition, in keeping with the growing understanding that farming has a wider role than food production, the CAP has been broadened, notably since 1992, to aid the delivery of environmental goals notably in this instance through agri-environment and since 2000 to a broader and planned approach to rural development. Agri-environment support is specifically given for actions going beyond good farm practice. In the Commission’s current proposals for rural development, there are several measures under the axis ‘Land Management’ which provide support for biodiversity both in the context of agri-environment and within the context of NATURA 2000 implementation.</p>
<p>It will be primarily for the Member States to apply these integration measures foreseen under the CAP. The Commission will continue to work closely with the Member States as well as farmers and other stakeholder groups to help achieve this objective. This will include strengthening ways to improve communication and dialogue with farmers and other land managers and owners, authorities and stakeholders in order to promote bird conservation within the new framework of Rural Development and in the context of the European model of multifunctional farming.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It has to be clarified that the Council decides itself on the issues on which it wants to have conclusions, and that it is not for the Commission to make suggestions here.

<p>The Commission is very much aware that osteoporosis is one of the least recognized chronic diseases, despite the fact that one in three women, and one in eight men, will suffer at least one osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. The promotion of lifestyles which can contribute to prevent osteoporosis – such as physical activity and a balanced nutrition – is amongst my main priorities for the coming years, and a series of activities in this area are under way or about to be launched.</p>

Finally, the 2005 Work Plan of the Public health Action Programme will again provide scope for the development of guidelines and best practice recommendations for osteoporosis prevention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0474"></a>

<p>(EN) This recent contamination incident has shown that the European Community has already in place the necessary comprehensive legislation to adequately manage such contamination incident.</p>
<p>Monitoring programs on dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in feed and food have been put in place across the EU. These programs have enabled the Dutch authorities to identify the contamination and to take the appropriate measures to eliminate its source.</p>
<p>Tracing and tracking systems are in place to identify potentially affected companies and farms. The necessary restrictive measures as regards these establishments have been taken to avoid that potentially contaminated feed and food could enter the food chain.</p>
<p>The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed acted with great efficiency in exchanging the information between competent authorities.</p>
<p>The established EU maximum levels on dioxins played a key role for the management of this contamination incident. Indeed they are a legal tool for taking decisions ensuring protection of public health.</p>
<p>It is in the Commission’s opinion unfortunately not possible through legislation to exclude completely any possibility of contamination of the food chain.</p>
<p>However, it is of major importance for the protection of public health that through monitoring any contamination is detected at a very early stage and that provisions are in place to remove and avoid further contamination of the food chain. Existing EU legislation provides already for this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this contamination incident has shown that it is necessary to assess the safety of not only the ingredients of feed and food but also of all products used directly or indirectly in processing of feed and food.</p>
<p>The Food Law lays down that feed and food business operators are responsible for the safety of their products. The Commission will continue to stress this issue with the operators and will monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent Member States to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>As regards the grazing of animals near landfills, Community legislation has been enacted to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way that does not endanger human health or the environment. The Commission is taking all appropriate measures to ensure correct application of this legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0481"></a>

<p>(EN) Budget 2004 for CFSP (Common Foreign Security Policy)</p>
<p>The CFSP budget for 2004 of €51.5 million proposed by the Commission was slightly above the Financial Programming which provided for an amount of € 50 million. Following meetings between both arms of the budgetary authority (Parliament and Council) an agreement was reached on a CFSP budget of €62.5 million for 2004.</p>
<p>Budget 2005 for CFSP</p>
<p>For 2005 the Commission proposal of € 55 million for the CFSP budget respected the Financial Programming. In other areas of the External relations budget, few reductions from the programming were needed in view of the proposals to finance the reconstruction of Iraq at the tune of € 200 million.</p>
<p>Since these reductions could not provide the full amount to finance Iraq Reconstruction, the Commission also proposed the mobilization of the Flexibility Instrument at the level of €115 million to finance for Iraq reconstruction. Against this background there was no scope to increase the CFSP budget beyond the Financial Programming.</p>
<p>In short, although the CFSP amount proposed by the Commission for 2005 decreased compared to the 2004 CFSP budget agreed by the Budgetary Authority, it respected the Commission’s Financial Programming which foresaw an increase from €50 million in 2004 to €55 million in 2005, while taking into account the tight situation in the external relations budget.</p>
<p>However, in the budgetary procedure for 2005, Parliament and Council have agreed to an amount for CFSP of €62.5 million which this House is asked to confirm in this week’s vote on the budget.</p>
<p>Possible flexibility in 2005 within the CFSP budget</p>
<p>Significant frontloading at the level of €10.5 million is foreseen in connection with certain Joint Actions to take effect from 2005. This is to ensure continuity of operations from 1 January of the following year and to cover the running expenditure of the first months of the year.</p>
<p>An additional increase of the CFSP budget might derive from potential recoveries from previous years CFSP budget.</p>
<p>With the additional budget agreed by the Budgetary authority as well as the front loading operations for 2005 and finally the amounts which might be recovered from previous years budget, the Commission is of the view that there is potentially more flexibility within the CFSP budget for 2005 than may appear at first glance.</p>
<p>In the present circumstances the Commission is therefore of the view that the 2005 budget for the CFSP should be adequately financed to fulfil the EU’s political commitments for 2005 to which the Honourable Member refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0486"></a>

<p>The Commission proposal on the introduction of a single fund to finance rural development with a view to the next financial perspective clearly places the competitiveness axis at a disadvantage by comparison with the remaining objectives of the new regulation on the operation of the second pillar of the CAP. Restricting aid for improving performance, marketing and processing to small and micro-enterprises will not only considerably reduce European Union support for making farms more competitive but will also jeopardise their future capacity to cope with the opening up of markets. Cooperatives, which already play a key role in bringing together supply in sectors such as fruit and vegetables, are excluded from such aid in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why it is specifically excluding medium-sized enterprises from these forms of support? Is there any reason other than saving money for the Community budget?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission believes that the proposal for a Council Regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (COM[2004]490 final) is balanced and does not discriminate against the axis relating to the agricultural competitiveness.</p>
<p>The proposed rate of 15% for this axis within the total EU funding for the programme represents a minimum. Member States can programme up to 60% of their total EAFRD allocation per rural development programme for the competitiveness axis, while still respecting the minimum rates for the other two axes.</p>
<p>As for the limitation of support to micro and small enterprises in the processing and marketing sector, the evaluations of support to processing and marketing show that bigger enterprises, which were granted investment aid, would have made these investments in many cases also without support. Focusing the support on the smaller enterprises, which often have less easy access to the capital market can reduce this “deadweight” effect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0490"></a>

<p>The Commission's recent decision to initiate an infringement procedure against Germany with regard to its postal legislation is a welcome effort to challenge the scope of postal monopolies in Europe.</p>
<p>The EU Postal Directive (Directive 2002/39/EC<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> with regard to the further opening to competition of Community postal services) clearly states that postal services may be reserved to the 'extent necessary to maintain the universal service obligation'. As the Commission found, German national legislation seems to go beyond that objective, enabling Deutsche Post to abuse its dominant position and thereby prevent other providers from entering the market.</p>
<p>What specific action can the Commission take to curtail the dominant position of national postal operators like Deutsche Post which results from a monopoly larger than what is deemed necessary, limit Deutsche Post's acquisitions spree and require it to reallocate its funds to the genuine provision of public postal services?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The question of the Honourable Member raises two issues. The first concerns the extent of the postal monopoly in Member States, in light of the provisions of Directive 97/67, as amended.</p>
<p>The application of the provision of the Postal Directive referred to in the question should be seen in the context of other provisions of this Directive, in particular, of the harmonised timetable for a gradual and controlled opening up of the letters market to competition that the Council and the Parliament set forth therein.</p>
<p>Any decision regarding the extent of reservation required for ensuring the maintenance of the universal service involves an appraisal of economic facts and conditions which are both complex and liable to change. Member States enjoy for these reasons an important degree of discretion in regulating this matter.</p>
<p>In this context, the extent of the actual reservation of the different Member States compared to the Directive’s requirements should also be taken into account. In particular, the reserved area for certain postal items by weight in Germany has been, and still is, smaller than the maximum area allowed for in the Postal Directive and full opening of the market is set in advance of the proposed Community timetable.</p>
<p>In this respect the recent Commission Decision mentioned by the Honourable Member (Decision of 20.10.2004 on the German postal legislation relating to mail preparation services) was aimed at preventing the abuse of the dominant position by the German universal service provider which was incited by the German legislation, as applied by the German authorities, as well as to ensure the respect of the reserved area as set in Directive 97/67/EC, as amended.</p>
<p>The second issue raised by the Honourable Member’s question concerns the possible use of revenues originated in the reserved area for a purpose other than the financing of the universal postal service. In this respect the Commission will apply competition rules in cases of apparent abuses of dominant positions resulting from cross-subsidisation of activities in separate markets and, more generally, in cases in which universal service providers abusively leverage their market power into markets open to competition.</p>
<p>National competition authorities, which are under an obligation to apply EC competition rules to abusive behaviour contrary to Article 82 EC, are also active in monitoring and, if need be, bringing to an end dominant operator’s behaviour. The Commission works in close contact with National Competition Authorities within the context of the procedures laid down in Council Regulation N° 1/2004 concerning the European Competition Network.</p>
<p>Furthermore, national authorities in the postal field are required by Directive 97/67, as amended, to ensure that a proper internal cost accounting system has been introduced to monitor and prevent the existence of cross-subsidies between the reserved area and activities under competition which may result in competitive distortions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
