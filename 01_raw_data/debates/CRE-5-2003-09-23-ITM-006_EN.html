I am always pleased to be offered the opportunity to examine competition policy issues with Parliament in greater depth, issues relating to which, incidentally, I have the honour to appear periodically before the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of your invitation this evening, Madam President, is a specific file which is currently under examination and about which I must therefore observe a measure of discretion. Within those limits, I am at your disposal to provide the explanations that will be asked of us.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the European Commission done about the Alstom file so far? It has taken a decision and it has decided not to take another. The decision to initiate the review procedure regards the support measures adopted by the French State on 2 August under an agreement with Alstom and a number of banks then the Commission was notified. This decision to initiate this procedure was taken by the college on 17 September. That was a perfectly normal decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the decision that was not taken. It concerns one specific part of the support plan that was decided and announced on 2 August but has not yet been put into effect: state participation in Alstom’s capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was unable to agree to an immediate participation by the French Republic in Alstom’s capital because a measure of that kind, unlike other contributions of liquid assets, was likely to have irreversible consequences for the markets on which the Alstom Group is active.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 September, the Commission therefore found that the conditions were such that the French authorities should be asked not to go ahead with a State holding in Alstom’s capital. The Commission, however, wanted to give France one last opportunity before proceeding with that injunction. It therefore authorised me to adopt and execute, by 22 September at the latest and by agreement with President Prodi, an injunction for the suspension of certain aids unless the French authorities publicly agreed not to take measures automatically and irreversibly entailing a State holding in the capital of the Alstom Group without the Commission’s prior approval as required by the Community rules concerning State aids.</p>
<p class="contents">Following speedy and fruitful contacts with the French authorities, I was able to note yesterday that they had agreed to amend the support plan in a way that satisfies the Commission’s condition.</p>
<p class="contents">The French state will not therefore become an Alstom shareholder in the immediate future and will not adopt any measures likely to constitute equity capital, that is structural measures to which the Commission cannot agree without prejudicing the findings of the competition inquiry it will be conducting.</p>
<p class="contents">The state participation in the capital increase will be replaced by a fixed-term floating-rate note redeemable in shares. It is a liquidity measure that may be converted into equity only if the Commission decides that the state participation in the capital increase presents no problems for competition on the markets in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Since France had agreed not to automatically acquire a stake in Alstom’s capital and had promised that it would no longer present the Commission with a <span class="italic">fait</span> <span class="italic">accompli</span>, there was no longer any need for me to exercise the power given me by the college of Commissioners to order a suspension. So that is the decision the Commission did not take.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased with the constructive attitude taken by French authorities and in particular, I would like to stress, by Mr Francis Mer, the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry. It was our duty to prevent the conditions of competition on the market from being immediately and irreversibly changed in Alstom’s favour before the Commission had even been able to begin looking at the effect of the aids on the markets in question. The changes made would probably have entailed an increase in the overall amount of aid granted. This shows the knock-on effect of a capital increase and its irreversible effects. In other words, it would never have been possible to restore the <span class="italic">status</span> <span class="italic">quo</span>. I would like to point out that the amount of aids will also be one of the key factors that the Commission will take into account when examining the matter in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it is not necessary to implement the suspending injunction does not, of course, at this stage mean that the Commission has approved the aids. The measures as a whole are now going to be examined. We will be able to undertake the in-depth scrutiny in a constructive spirit and will do so as quickly as the complexity of the matter allows. The aim is to enable the undertaking to be restructured while at the same time preserving the proper working of the internal market, which is the only guarantee of sustainable employment. In the course of its assessment, the Commission will check the undertaking’s long-term viability and the proportionality between the amount of aid granted and what France will be willing to accept in return in order to preserve the conditions of competition on the markets in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that there is absolutely no position of principle involved on the part of the Commission concerning the system of ownership of undertakings in the Member States. You know as well as I do that the Treaty provides for and therefore imposes on us the strictest neutrality in the matter of public or private ownership of undertakings. I am therefore very much aware that the suspension was not designed to prevent the French state’s entry into Alstom’s capital as such. The Commission’s desire was to prevent aid-constituting measures from producing irreversible consequences on the markets in question without the Commission’s prior approval, that is in violation of the rules of the Treaty concerning state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not let it be said that the Commission is against the public ownership of undertakings. As I have always stressed, it is not the Commission that asks a Member State to open the capital of public undertakings like the French Government is doing with <span class="italic">Électricité de France</span>, for example. Those choices are entirely up to the Member State concerned. What the Commission does have a duty to do under the Treaties is to ensure that undertakings, whether public or private, comply with the competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I would like to stress the quality of our cooperation, based on a constructive spirit and one of confidence, with the French Government and Minister Mer in particular. Some of the reactions and remarks heard from French political and economic circles recently would benefit from a more detached analysis. I understand the feelings of the trade unions perfectly. I am well aware of the Alstom Group’s importance in the European industrial and social fabric. On the other hand, I find it harder to understand the reference made here and there recently in the French debate to the European Commission acting like a lawyer and allegedly having no political awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Can people not see the political value of preserving a single market with no distortions of competition, a necessary, not sufficient, true, but necessary part of a social market economy? Can they not see the political merit of preventing a State from bypassing the rules of the single market the chief beneficiaries of which are European undertakings themselves and the possibilities for growth, including growth in employment? Can they not see the political necessity of inspiring confidence in Europe as a whole by demonstrating to the citizens of the small and future Member States that the Commission, in its role of guardian of the Treaty, is not strict with the small ones and weak with the big ones? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as I do on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to make three things very clear, especially to those who, following Commissioner Monti’s statements, have forced today’s debate upon us. Any criticism of the Commission is unfounded, and there is no reason to change competition policy; on the contrary, indeed, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Commission and, above all, to Commissioner Monti, whose actions over recent days have been marked by calmness, consistency and frankness, and who has been willing to engage in dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 September, we read in <span class="italic">Agence Europe</span> that Commissioner Monti had said, ‘We are open to dialogue, and I am still confident that we will find a solution capable of safeguarding the integrity of the Common Market without distorting competition. This is a necessary condition for healthy European industry and for lasting employment.’</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 September, again in <span class="italic">Agence Europe,</span> Mr Monti had this to say: ‘The Commission has never had negative prejudices against France and Alstom, but it was our duty to check that no direct and irrevocable change was made to conditions of competition in the market.’ He went on to say: ‘I am happy to let it be known that the French authorities have fully complied with the Commission’s conditions’. End of quotation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, a sensitive case, but it is an issue of state aid. Yes, of course this company is of enormous importance on our continent. The Commission cannot, however, make adherence to EU law conditional on the size of a company and the number of people it employs. When questions are raised or something goes wrong, it has to intervene. All over the media, we read today’s headlines: ‘All banks agree rescue plan.’ ‘French industrial giant Alstom saved!’ ‘Alstom shares fall after initial rescue.’ ‘Paris urges Alstom industrial conglomerate to restructure.’ ‘Battle for the future of 110 000 jobs.’ This is a sensitive issue, but can we really claim that we would have wanted or expected the Commission to act in a different way? I can speak for my group when I say that no, we would not, even though our hearts are in the right place where the associated problems are concerned and there is adequate awareness of the problems associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of three articles in the new constitution. Article 3(2) will read: ‘The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, and an internal market where competition is free and undistorted’. In Article 4(2), we adopt and put on the record our prohibition on discrimination within the internal market as a domestic market. In Article 5(2) we lay it down that ‘Member States shall facilitate the achievement of the Union’s tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives set out in the Constitution.’ In Lisbon, we resolved to become, by 2010, the most competitive continent in the world. Let me emphasise that state subsidies need to be approved. Anything that distorts competition cries out to be investigated by the Commission, after conditions have been fulfilled and time limits have elapsed. Anything that goes against EU law must be prohibited. All discrimination is banned. Whatever weakens the internal market is irresponsible, as it damages growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has committed itself to the social market economy, and hence also to social responsibility. We are committed to the internal market and to competition, on which the creation of new jobs and growth depend. Commissioner Monti is its independent regulator. He has our entire support, and he has done the right thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, at our initiative, the Alstom trades union representatives have visited the European Parliament on several occasions. As long ago as 1999, they condemned serious management errors committed by the group’s directors. On 17 February 2000, here in Parliament, we adopted a resolution expressing a warning about the future risks facing the business. At the time, certain people stood up to speak and, in the name of the sacrosanct principles of liberalism, condemned this as an incongruous and, inevitably, incompetent intrusion of politics into economics – an experience that should give us all pause for serious thought.</p>
<p class="contents">The coordinator of the Alstom Europe unions, Mrs Francine Blanche, was telling me yesterday evening that the employees were naturally pleased about the Commission’s approval, in principle, of the rescue plan. However, they remember the many warnings given by their elected representatives, warnings that have never been taken seriously at any level. They are not about to agree to be the victims of this rescue now. Mrs Blanche gave me to understand that, since his appointment in January of this year, the new chairman of the group, Mr Kron, had devoted no more than two hours to discussions with the European representatives of the employees. Such arrogance is no longer tolerable. The need is enormous, and the demands are loud for those employees to exercise their rights as employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Already, Commissioner, Alstom’s European trades union coordinators are asking to be received, heard and listened to by the Commission. In the meantime, they will have studied the plan in detail and will be in a position to propose measures to achieve savings which will not take the form of job losses. That is what will happen in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">After that, this enormously important affair places certain major questions squarely on the agenda of the debate on the future of the European Union. I shall mention three of these.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these issues is the social dialogue, or rather the essential new rights of employees. Those timid and dust-covered directives on informing and consulting workers and on the European Works Council must be revised. Real rights must be established, even the right to suspend a restructuring plan so as to enable a second expert opinion to be obtained and all the available options considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that European industrial policy does not exist. All that exists is a race for state aids in the name of the competition rules. Yet in the present case, conversely, if there had not been any state aids, world economic competition would have been seriously distorted, given, on the one hand, what would be left of European industries in the strategic sectors of energy and the railways and, on the other, American giants such as General Electric, or those of Japan such as Mitsubishi.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the democratic functioning of the Union makes it necessary to review the discretionary powers granted to the Commission in competition matters. It is essential that the social partners, the national parliaments and, of course, Parliament should have their say as regards the criteria to be met, the objectives to be assigned, and the controls to be exercised. Where would have been the legitimacy, in the minds of our fellow citizens, in implementing the Commission’s initial threat to refuse the rescue plan for a strategic business which employs 118 000 people?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Alstom case is a powerful reminder of the essential political choices to which the public debate on the European constitution will be leading us. For all these reasons, it was well worth adding this item to our agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission was perfectly right to sanction the French Government for the arrogance and contempt for the common rules which it has demonstrated in this affair. This incident is only part of a long series of incidents. The way in which Mr Raffarin’s government openly flouted the provisions of the Stability Pact, even though President Chirac had been one of its initiators and unconditional supporters, will make it difficult to renegotiate that pact, something that even Mr Prodi himself describes as stupid. There are other examples, such as the Raffarin government’s contempt for the Directive on the conservation of wild birds and the Natura 2000 Directive, which resulted in the massacre in the wetlands of Poitou. The icing on the cake is Mr Raffarin’s statement in which he talks about the legal requirements for the executive authority of the European Union as if it were some office in a foreign country. For this shameful statement I should like, on behalf of the great majority of French people who are aware of the fact that Europe is not a foreign country but rather our joint home, to offer our apologies to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement has been reached today, and in this I rejoice. It will make it possible to save Alstom from imminent bankruptcy, something for which the directors, and those of ABB, are entirely responsible, despite warnings from their union members. It will give the French Government and the Commission time to negotiate formally a final solution. Having said that, Competition Commissioner, I should like to say a few words about the substance of this affair.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that our group, the Greens, has loyally supported your efforts to defend consumers against the abusive practices of monopolies. My report on competition in 2001 bears witness to that fact. Nevertheless, I made certain observations which we have discussed in detail face to face, not only between Commissioner and MEP, but also between one economist and another. The Alstom affair once again gives me the opportunity to tell you this.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection consists, first of all, in guaranteeing consumers the existence of the supply of goods or services, before even thinking about the price of those goods or services. In other words it consists in implementing an industrial policy. The disappearance of Alstom, which would have caused the collapse of Asean Brown Boveri, would have greatly reduced the European supply of electricity turbines and high-speed trains, just at the time when the climate crisis and the Kyoto Agreement are calling for enormous investment in these two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Then again, what applies in the case of network infrastructures, where economic theory shows that monopolies and public subsidies are sometimes preferable to pure competition, often applies, <span class="italic">ipso facto</span>, to the oligopoly which is responsible for constructing and maintaining those networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the brutal way in which the Raffarin Government was put in its place was perceived by the employees and the people who live in the regions concerned as a piece of brutality and inhumanity directed against them personally by a Europe which is once again being experienced as a foreign and hostile institution. In the final analysis the position of the Raffarin Government means privatising profits and nationalising losses. I do not approve of that and neither do you. You need to be able to demonstrate that European competition policy is aimed at keeping excessive profits in check and promoting the supply of public goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say right away that that is a matter which is of no interest to us. We are not here to give you our support, any more than we are here to give Mr Mer our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have to consider is simple: does Europe, the European Union – and more specifically the Commission of which you are a member – have a clear industrial policy? Ought we to have blind faith in you? The answer is ‘no’. I do not see any clear industrial policy. As for having blind faith in you, the decisions which have been taken by the Court of Justice, which have overturned three of the decisions which you had taken, demonstrate only too well that this is not possible. I do not doubt your good intentions, but I do doubt the efficacy and the justice of the decisions that you take. At all events this affair has revealed that even the European Commission, whatever its claims, when confronted with an exceptionally serious problem involving one country, cannot do anything either. I would be the first to admit that the French Government has presented its case badly. However, I would also like to say that the way in which you yourself have reacted is not calculated to help Alstom either. Finally, it would seem that both sides have now seen reason to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, in conclusion, the Mr Lipietz is in the wrong place. If he wants to criticise the French Government, he should not do it here, because it is not the job of this House to judge the French Government. Come and do it in a different forum, Mr Lipietz, in our own country, where people will be able to give you an answer.</p>

Admittedly, Mr Monti, your strong-arm tactics enabled you to impose your will on the French Government. Let us admit it: you even made it look ridiculous. That government, which had rejected all the figures on the Friday, then spent the weekend producing a whole lot more, with the support of every bank in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">You have won then, but at what price? All Europeans now know that Brussels can sacrifice 120 000 jobs without losing sleep over it, that it can ruin such prestigious industrial sites as Belfort or St-Nazaire, simply in order to get its own back. Mr Pasqua mentioned this a moment ago – the wounded pride of a European Commissioner. You are playing with communities, Mr Monti, simply in order to satisfy unimportant dogmas and your own vanity. You are not a lawyer, Mr Monti. Indeed, to call you a lawyer would be a compliment, since there are many lawyers who are actually working in the interests of families and their inheritance. You are only a bailiff, the man who carries out the process of seizing this social market economy, which can best be summed up as follows: the market is economising on society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Monti, we, the people of France, already have you to thank for the fact that Péchinet was abandoned. You did not allow us to buy back Alcan, even though you could have done so. We might have had you to thank for the ruin of Schneider and of Legrand. Do you not sometimes think that you are to European industry what Torquemada was to the Catholic religion? In other words, you are playing the grand inquisitor in hunting down state aids just as the good Torquemada, if I may put it this way, hunted down heresy, sodomy and to some extent, let us admit it, Jews. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an extremely bitter foretaste of the future that lies in store for a Europe of nation states in thrall. The people of France, surprised and shocked, have suddenly discovered the reality of Europe, a technocratic and imperialist octopus, which puts balance sheets before people, and Community legalism before enterprise. It is not a Europe of industry, growth and employment that the Commission is preparing, but rather a vast industrial wasteland, a Europe of delocalisation, unemployment, economic decline and social vulnerability. France has gone from independence to dependence, from liberty to submission, to the extent that it is now reduced to sending its government to beg our lords and masters in Brussels for new conditions and for new time limits – a pitiable and humiliating spectacle! Finally, an agreement obtained only after a hard fight will not hide for long the vital need for the French people to recover their freedoms, their economic and social independence, their political sovereignty and, quite simply, their dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The support package amounts to EUR 2.8 billion. EUR 2.8 billion, that is a generous package, and it could also be said that it is, for the most part, a generous present from the state that is of doubtful benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is impossible to eradicate from Europe the erroneous belief that money can be used to prop up uncompetitive structures. I would argue for temporary support to avoid structures breaking down and to allow them to change, but I am concerned that even in this way uncompetitive structures will continue to be supported. The convertible loan, which is on the cards as a compromise, is nothing more than an invitation to the French state to exchange this for shares after this enquiry, which would once again result in the re-nationalisation of Alstom.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely this mindset in Europe of not wanting to allow structural change, the belief that state money should, as a matter of principle, be used to avoid structural change, that is damaging for Europe as a business location. The International Monetary Fund has once again pointed out that it is the large states, Germany, France and Italy, that act as bottlenecks on the continent and are thus responsible for the fact that the next boom will probably pass Europe by.</p>
<p class="contents">The elimination of businesses that cannot sustain competition is part of the market economy, and, let me add, also part of the social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else of importance for me is that today, Mr Monti, we can read the headlines saying that the test of strength has been passed. I see that as positive and I should like to congratulate you on this in this House. It was important that the French state should not put before the Commission a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> without being asked. No, this European Union is a Community based on the rule of law and this includes competition law. I can only invite all national states to heed this law. From 2001 to date there has been an increase in state aid – EUR 88 billion to date within the European Union – that is revealing and something to fear. I think that the nation states are well advised to adhere to competition law, in particular on the eve of the enlargement of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, let me just say, in reaction to the previous speaker, that businesses just stop - they go out of business. That is the reality. We have to remind ourselves of what we are trying to address tonight, which is the reality of 110 000 jobs. The reality is that if you do not have a job, you cannot pay your bills or support yourself. This House needs to recognise that we must come together to create better social dialogue and a better awareness and social responsibility for those in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom alone, 10 000 jobs rest with Alstom. We need to support Alstom. The uncertainty over the aid is not helpful. There are already concerns that plants in Washwood Heath (Birmingham), Rugby and Stafford face an unnecessary and uncertain future. We need to give them certainty and encourage development and investment. We are not doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">We need flexibility of application in the rules on state aid. When we are dealing with huge social upheaval we must also look at the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I support this refinancing package, but it must not be at the expense of British workers and British jobs. There is real concern for those in the transmission and distribution businesses that their business is likely to be transferred to Arriva. There is real concern about the final salary pension schemes of those workers. We must give them some form of certainty. My big fear tonight is that we will conclude that Alstom <span class="italic">may</span> survive and get the support of the European Union. What we need to say is that Alstom <span class="italic">will</span> survive, and we must do everything possible to ensure that survival and protect those 110 000 jobs.

<p class="contents">Admittedly the Commission has just told us yet again that it is only applying the Treaty and I have to admit, Mr Monti, that that is true. The Treaty itself poses a problem, because its wording, in the ‘competition’ part, goes back to the Treaty of Rome. It proves that our vision of competition is now too narrow, too focused on the internal market, whereas we should be taking a more global view of the strategic, national and European interests at stake in what is now worldwide competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in the Alstom affair, the French Government was defending, in the last analysis, a more balanced and more global position than the Commission. In this way it was demonstrating that a nation state, democratically responsible, was perfectly capable of assessing whether state aid should be given in order to save, in exceptional circumstances, industries that are strategically important for the economic independence or cultural identity of the country. It would have been better if the Commission had helped it and cooperated in achieving that objective. Any future reform of the Treaty ought to take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we deplore the fact that Mr Monti, in his statements just now, has continued to allow the sword of Damocles to hang over the plan to rescue Alstom, and we deplore the fact that the Commission has absolute power in this area. On that too it will be necessary to reform the Treaty in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will come straight to the point; it is perhaps a reflection of our different views that I want some answers from the Commission about the way forward. It is clear this business has to be restructured and that it must change in its present form because of the lack of demand for its products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to ask the Commission, firstly, its views about the sale of the transmission and distribution division to Arriva. Could the Commissioner confirm that this will not be subject to any further delays for competition purposes or, if that disposal or sale is to be referred to him, that he will speed up the procedure as much as possible, so that the employees and that very important division with a long-term future are not affected by any more uncertainty?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other parts of the undertaking are concerned, will he confirm that the Alstom management will be free to consider offers and to sell other parts of the business to whomsoever they choose and wherever they come from? We know that there are businesses in Germany and potentially in Japan and America which would be interested in giving a future to employees by reconsolidating the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, will he look at the competition implications in the transport business, and at the fact that within the United Kingdom the majority of railway rolling stock is manufactured outside the country, whereas other countries seem quite capable of introducing into their contracts provisions to ensure that rolling stock is made in their own country? That is a crucial issue that will affect the future of an excellent railway assembly plant in Birmingham where there is no future work. At any rate, as part of a restructuring process, we would like to see those people employed in making trains for the United Kingdom market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us not deceive ourselves: behind all the good reasons put forward by one side or the other, this issue will be a political test of the first order for the European Union as far as public opinion is concerned. This issue, which concerns one of the jewels in the crown of industrial and technological Europe, on which hangs the future of 118 000 employees throughout the world, is a practical test of both the European project and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we do not underestimate the extent to which the French Government, forced into a corner, making its clumsiness and its attempts to lay down the law even worse, has presented us with a fait accompli by publishing a rescue plan before negotiating with the Commission, as it is obliged to do under the Treaties. However, Mr Mer must be aware that in the past, on the basis of the same Treaties, another French Government, that of Mr Fabius, succeeded, without any difficulty and without any vain polemics from Brussels, in saving the French steel industry in circumstances which were difficult in other ways. Believe me, we are the first to suffer, we the elected representatives of France, when we see the Prime Minister of our country prostrating himself here in order to ask you to accept record deficits, and, at the same time, the reduction of VAT for his voters in the restaurant trade. It is true to say that in this behaviour, on the part of a country like France towards the European Union, there is something similar to, and as unilateral and arrogant as, the behaviour of Mr Bush towards the United Nations. Unfortunately, however, he needs a diversion and a scapegoat. He needs the old trick of treating himself to false victories when faced with the bureaucracy of Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, Commissioner, this episode, which can only be the herald of others like it, given the worrying movements towards deindustrialisation and delocalisation which are affecting the brightest jewels in our industrial crown, should make us, as Europeans, ask ourselves about the place and the status of our policy on competition within the Union. It is becoming increasingly outrageous and intolerable that our competition policy, in a context that is quite different from that of the Treaties by which it was established in 1986 and 1992, should remain bound by the impassable horizon of being simply a policy of the European Union. Many voices – too many, and increasingly credible – are being raised to claim that Europe cares more about the inexorable law of the market than any of the most free-market countries in the world, starting with the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, faced with the inexorable affirmation of the new major powers of tomorrow, Europe needs to look at things and judge them from an angle other than that of unbridled competition. It needs an industrial policy which is capable of protecting its national champions, of safeguarding its priceless technical heritage and its precious <span class="italic">savoir-faire</span>. It needs a social policy which aims to maintain living standards and the employment of the greatest possible number of Europeans. What is at stake here is, first and foremost, a social issue of primary importance, but also the competitiveness of Europe in the world at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how can we make our peoples understand that an administrative authority over which there is no parliamentary control should alone take a decision of such importance that thousands of workers’ families are now awaiting it with bated breath and with anguish in their hearts?</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond the decision that you take – and I cannot imagine that it will be a second negative – the whole meaning of the European project and the structure of the current Treaties are being called into question here. In this respect, we can only hope, if such a thing is possible, that the next Intergovernmental Conference will tackle this need to push forward, side by side and on equal terms with competition policy, a social policy of employment and an industrial policy which will enable the Union to defend its economic and social interests in the global world in which we shall be living from now on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking Mr Karas for expressing his full support for the Commission’s work: he mentioned the new draft Constitution and the Lisbon strategy. I believe that we must also take note of the fact that, whenever the Heads of State or Government meet in the European Council, they send out clear calls for state aid to be cut and channelled into horizontal objectives rather than into supporting any particular sectors or businesses. Therefore, it is not just the fantasies of the European Commissioners that are taking this direction. Mr Karas also pointed out – and I agree with him fully – that competition is, although not the only factor, of course, an essential element in the social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz, thank you for pointing out the different occasions – 1999, February 2000 – on which the trade unions brought to the attention of the European Parliament, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the deterioration of <span class="italic">Alstom</span>’s financial situation and position within the industry. This helps us to place the issue in its historical and chronological context and to eliminate the over-simplified view – expressed by some malicious rumourmongers in recent days - that it is the European Commission who will be responsible for any unemployment problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, Mr Wurtz, am extremely sensitive to the need for the trade unions to be fully informed and made aware of these issues, just as the public authorities need to be aware of how the trade unions are coping with them. I therefore have no hesitation in agreeing to your request for a meeting with the <span class="italic">Coordination syndicale Alstom </span>and I can tell you that I have, in any case, already agreed to a request for a meeting which is to take place in the next few days with the European Trade Union Federation, to which this association belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz, together with almost all the speakers - Mr Lipietz, Mr Pasqua, Mr Savary and others - mentioned the need for a European industrial policy. I hope I will not cause offence if I say that I fully agree with them. A European industrial policy is something which has as a foundation stone, as an essential component, the promotion of a single market under conditions of competition. Please let us not create confusion by saying that the single market and competition are contrary to the requirements of an industrial policy. An industrial policy needs other things as well, but if you ask French, German or Italian entrepreneurs what the European Union’s essential contribution is to their industrial activities and their expansion and export activities, etc., they will reply: the single market, a single market in which the conditions for competition are preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, other things are necessary too, and, in the Commission, I always support the initiatives of Commissioner Liikanen, Commissioner Busquin and the Vice-President, Mrs De Palacio, seeking to find other ways of boosting Europe’s industrial development, but I feel that it would be an extremely serious error to think that we can further industrial policy by eating away at the foundations of the single market and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz said that the Commission has discretionary power in the field of competition which is not subject to control. Mr Pasqua provided part of the answer when he pointed out that there have been cases in which judicial control, which always applies to all Commission decisions, including in the field of competition, has rejected some of the European Commission’s decisions. The Commission certainly does not claim to be infallible and still less do I. Our actions are subject to two levels of judicial control: the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice. In the great majority of cases, these judicial bodies rule in favour of the Commission’s decision; in others, they do not.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to political legitimacy, Mr Wurtz, decisions relating to competition policy are taken in the individual Member States at national level by bodies which do not have the political legitimacy which the European Commission has conferred on it at European level by the European Parliament, in particular, with individual hearings for each Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lipietz made a number of points relating to French internal politics, on which I do not believe he expects me to express an opinion. I welcome the support given by both the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by Mr Lipietz, personally, as he has stated on many occasions, to competition policy as an essential tool for consumer protection. By the way, I would like to say that one of the tasks of competition policy is, without a doubt, to guarantee a secure supply of products, and there is even a specific legal instrument, what is known as ‘failing company defence’, which makes it possible for the potential disappearance of operators from the market, which could jeopardise security of supply, to be taken into account in competition policy decisions. It is not, therefore, such an inflexible, blinkered policy as might be imagined at first glance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pasqua - who appears to have left the Chamber - said that he is not prepared to place blind trust in the Commission. I would point out, if I may, that, even if he were prepared to do so, the Commission would not want blind trust to be placed in it at all. It is extremely important that the Commission acts in close cooperation with Parliament and in accordance with Parliament’s basic guidelines and, in any case, in particular in these matters, under the strict control of the judicial authority based in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pasqua, too, mentioned the need for a clear industrial policy for Europe. President Prodi and the Commission as a whole, all the Commissioners, are reflecting on the effects of the deindustrialisation of Europe, which we all feel cannot be dealt with just by giving the Member States licence to breach competition rules or state aid legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abitbol talked of the ‘<span class="italic">orgueil blessé d'un commissaire européen’</span>. Quite frankly, I do not believe it is a matter of any particular <span class="italic">orgueil</span>, nor that it has received <span class="italic">blessures</span>. Then, as regards to the difference between the professions of notary and <span class="italic">huissier</span>, I do not think it is at all relevant: they are both, in any case, occupations, professions, which deserve the greatest respect, as, I believe, does the job of European Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abitbol’s comment on European Commission decisions which have allegedly harmed the development of French industry is interesting: interesting and curious, for I always mention France in my speeches as an example of a country whose industry has benefited greatly while observing European competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are some examples, Mr Abitbol - and I am addressing Mr Berthu, too, here – of cases in which French companies, with the authorisation of the European Commission, have succeeded in becoming either French national industry leaders or European industry leaders or world industry leaders. These are genuine examples, and I will confine myself to mentioning cases from recent years. <span class="italic">Total-Fina-Elf</span>, the result of a merger authorised by the Commission, has become a major industry leader, to say the least, in France, as has <span class="italic">Carrefour-Promodes</span>. The merger in the field of nuclear plant engineering between <span class="italic">Maton</span> and <span class="italic">Siemens</span> created <span class="italic">Arriva</span>, which a number of Members have mentioned this evening, a major European industry leader, and, thanks to the then Managing Director, Francis Mère, the <span class="italic">Usinor </span>group, with the authorisation of the Commission, merged successfully with other European iron and steel companies to create <span class="italic">Arcelor</span>, which is not the European industry leader but the world industry leader, the largest iron and steel group operating in the world today. I therefore believe that it is possible to reconcile consumer protection, which is the primary task of competition policy, with the creation of large structures which can compete at international level. In this, therefore, I agree with Mr Berthu that we need to have a global vision for global markets, although not, of course, where the markets are still national or local.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lange described the European Commission’s attitude as ‘arrogant and dogmatic’ – I believe these were the words he used. I would not presume to disagree with him if this is his opinion; I think I have explained today and on other occasions how and why we act as we do, and that we are convinced that our work is not so<span class="bold"> </span>much based purely on legal formalism but on the need to give the European economy strong foundations and to ensure respect for rules, not least as a principle of democratic peaceful coexistence, if I may use that term, at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Konrad rightly pointed out, the European Union is a community of law – I do not feel this is a pejorative term – which is founded on respect for rules in a number of fields, and since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, I believe that it also has a duty to ensure that they are observed. Mr Konrad pointed out that, ultimately, state aid often leads to loss of money without bringing any significant tangible benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Mr Cashman is in favour of aid to the <span class="italic">Alstom</span> group, provided that this does not harm the British workers. This would appear to be a very respectable position on the matter, taking a specific point of view. Our task is to attempt to preserve the jobs of the employees of the <span class="italic">Alstom</span> group by facilitating a restructuring plan and, at the same time, while preventing excessively serious distortions to trade, to stop the employees of competing firms from losing their jobs. This is the task of state aid control. Of course, the loss of currently existing jobs from a specific area is always going to have a higher profile than the other jobs we manage to save elsewhere in Europe by ensuring respect for the rules. In any case, I can assure you that the preservation and expansion of employment is something to which the Commission attaches great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour asked me some actually very specific questions, in particular whether the Commission will have to decide, I imagine in the context of concentration control, whether the sale of <span class="italic">Alstom</span>’s transmission and distribution division to <span class="italic">Arriva</span> is to take place quickly. If that task falls to us, I can assure you that we will decide quickly for, as Mr Harbour knows, the regulation on concentration control in Europe, unlike that in force in the United States, for example, lays down extremely short, unextendable deadlines for such decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to apologise, for I am not qualified to comment on the issue of the Birmingham establishment or on the varying degrees of dependence of the different Member States on foreign manufacturers in the purchase of railway rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, with a simple observation. If we look back at cases of state aid authorised by the Commission for restructuring plans and at the occasions when it was employed, we see that, in many of those cases, the state aid did not help: in other words, those companies, those jobs, were not saved in spite of the state aid. In those - numerous – cases, the end result was, nevertheless, job losses, plant closures and, what is more, increased taxation to replenish the state coffers, affecting taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the matter before us is not an easy one to resolve. I can assure you that the Commission will endeavour to exercise due control with all due responsibility. Thank you very much for your thoughtful contributions to this debate, both those expressing support and those expressing criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
