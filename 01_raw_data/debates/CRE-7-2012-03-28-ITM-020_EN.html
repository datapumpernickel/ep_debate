In particular, I welcome your rapporteur, Charles Tannock’s, continuous balanced and positive contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is strong public support for Montenegro’s EU integration as well as national consensus on this objective among the political parties. This has enabled the country to work systematically with the reform efforts. In December last year, both the Council and the European Council welcomed the Commission’s assessment that Montenegro has achieved overall satisfactory results, notably with regard to the key priorities set out by the EU in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to opening accession negotiations by June this year, the European Council has tasked the Council to examine Montenegro’s progress in implementing reforms. Among the focus areas are the rule of law, fundamental rights, the fight against corruption and organised crime. The Commission is now preparing a report on the implementation, which it will most probably present in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro has achieved a high degree of compliance with the membership criteria. The country has progressed towards establishing a market economy and strives to live up to the obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Montenegro’s relations with its neighbours are very good and Montenegro has been actively involved in a number of regional initiatives, such as the Southeast European Cooperation Process which Montenegro chaired in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro has also been actively involved in the Sarajevo Process on finding a solution for the refugees and internally displaced persons in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia following the conflict in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Montenegro still has some way to go. It has to continue its reform efforts and ensure full implementation, especially concerning the rule of law. Progress in this area is particularly needed when it comes to internally displaced persons, media freedom, implementation of anti-discrimination policies and independence of the judiciary. We look forward to the conclusions of the constitutional reform which will enhance independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime will also be key to the advancement of Montenegro in its EU integration process. I am convinced that we will see progress in these areas and that Montenegro’s accession process will provide further positive momentum in the Western Balkans. With the historic agreements in the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, the decision of 1 March 2012 to grant candidate status to Serbia and the ongoing smooth ratification process of Croatia’s Accession Treaty, strong signals have been sent by the EU to the region and this will hopefully encourage neighbouring countries and regions to make the right political choices.</p>
<p class="contents">If these reform efforts in Montenegro continue at the same pace, it is my hope that this will be possible, and that we can agree to open accession negotiations with Montenegro in June. We in the Danish Presidency will work closely with Parliament and the Commission to achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to express my warm gratitude and congratulations to the rapporteur for Montenegro, Charles Tannock, on his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision of the December European Council is a fair recognition of the progress the country has made over the five years since its independence, and in particular since December 2010 when it was granted European Union candidate status. This decision has opened the door towards the start of accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Key to this success was the determination of the Montenegrin authorities to conduct ambitious reforms, together with the active involvement of the parliamentary opposition, civil society and the media. I am positive that this broad national consensus on the country’s European integration is a major asset for Montenegro. It will facilitate its continued steady progress towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I met the Montenegrin Prime Minister, Igor Lukšić last week. His determination to pursue the reform process and commitment to sustained progress in the country’s European Union agenda are commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am further encouraged by our shared understanding that the opening of accession negotiations will not mark the end of a process, but the beginning of a long and demanding journey.</p>
<p class="contents">As acknowledged in Mr Tannock’s report, Montenegro has made significant progress so far, but needs to deploy further efforts in the area of rule of law, in particular in the fight against corruption and organised crime. The track record of final convictions, notably for high-level corruption and organised crime, needs to be substantially increased and all alleged cases thoroughly investigated. In line with the 2006 renewed consensus on enlargement, we know the importance of addressing these issues as early as possible in the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">The new approach for the negotiation chapters – 23 on the judiciary and fundamental rights, and 24 on justice, freedom and security – will allow them to be opened early in order to give Montenegro sufficient time to produce a solid track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. As I am speaking to you, the first explanatory phase of the screening of Chapter 24 is taking place, while the one on Chapter 23 took place earlier this week.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important milestone for Montenegro will be the finalisation of the ongoing constitutional reform, in line with the recommendations of the Venice Commission, in a spirit of consensus and constructive dialogue with the opposition parties. This will provide a solid guarantee for the independence and accountability of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with European standards in the field of human rights and minority rights is also of crucial importance, in particular regarding freedom of expression and anti-discrimination. The recent attack against an investigative journalist is unacceptable and needs to be thoroughly investigated, along with past cases of violence and vandalism directed against the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Further efforts are also needed to strengthen anti-discrimination policy, in particular from the aspect of gender equality and the effective protection of minority rights. Efforts to increase the number of legally registered displaced persons also need to be actively pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for addressing these outstanding challenges lies with Montenegro and its capacity to maintain the pace of reforms and ensure their effective implementation. The Commission will continue to support Montenegro’s efforts on its path towards the European Union through financial and expert assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Montenegro has worked hard to address the criteria and benchmarks set by you as Commissioner in seven key priority areas, namely improving the work of its parliament and the electoral framework, professionalism within the administration of Montenegro, independence of the judiciary, fighting corruption, combating organised crime, ensuring media freedom and cooperation within civil society. Montenegro – to its credit – was admitted to the World Trade Organisation in December last year. WTO accession will inevitably help Montenegro build a competitive and dynamic modern economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This signals Montenegro’s integration into the world economy as well. The major political Copenhagen criteria issues, which include inter-ethnic relations, gender, religious, ethnic and disability discrimination, the repatriation of IDPs, independence and transparency of the judiciary, and freedom of the media, are very fully covered in my resolution. As a country with outstanding natural beauty, tourism plays a major role in Montenegro’s economy as well. Protecting the environment from the building of hydroelectric dams and energy policy transparency are therefore natural priorities for the Montenegrin Government.</p>
<p class="contents">My current resolution on Montenegro’s progress also focuses on the economy. By freeing up the country from too much red tape and bureaucracy, this will encourage business and promote growth through foreign direct investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro is also well known as a champion of better regional cooperation with its immediate neighbours, and its achievements in this area include resolving an outstanding small border dispute with Croatia and leading the fight against organised crime in a region which sadly has too much of it. Last year it successfully concluded bilateral extradition treaties with Serbia, Macedonia and Croatia. In short, Montenegro is a good news story and it is hoped that the negotiations will now start in June of 2012 for EU accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sometimes I think that, when we look back on this period of history, people will not just look at the economic turmoil but they will look at the fact that the Berlin Wall came down suddenly and miraculously in 1989; and here we are, with 10 new Member States such a short time after that, talking about Montenegro joining the European Union, given the recent history of the former Yugoslavia. This is indeed miraculous and it is what we need in Europe and is what the whole foundation of Europe was about from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this. I welcome the progress that has been made by Montenegro in the way they have addressed this issue so far, but the European Union is open to any European country which is a democracy and can take on the responsibilities of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I raise this issue only because it is a difficult issue for smaller Member States. At some stage we have to again look at the institutional issues. Can we continue to expand in the way we are expanding, for example, and have a Commission with an ever-increasing number of Commissioners? In my country the answer to that is ‘Yes’, because small countries guard this with great jealousy. But if this question is to be addressed – and I am sure it is on the agenda somewhere – let it be addressed in such a way that it is not a power grab by large Member States. This is the one place where Member States, irrespective of their size, have equality, and I would ask the Commissioner to keep that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I do welcome the progress that has been made and it is great to see that the reasoning behind the origins of the European Union is still alive and well, and that we are broadening and deepening and making this continent a stable place for the future and a place where we can conduct our affairs in a more united way internationally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that the EU Member States are now starting accession negotiations with Montenegro. This is a strong signal of the EU’s commitment to the future of the whole of the Western Balkans within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the candidate countries to genuinely be judged purely on their own merits and their progress in meeting the accession criteria. The resolution is very clear in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro deserves praise for its commitment, its constructive role in helping to bring about regional stability and its good relations with its neighbours. It has also made progress – a great deal of progress – as Mr Tannock has pointed out, in fulfilling the key priorities that the Commission set on a previous occasion, but there is still a great deal to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The work to bring about reform will require a strong political will to tackle tough challenges, particularly those relating to the principle of the rule of law and to combating corruption, smuggling and organised crime. There remains a great deal to be done in this regard, and real success here will be important for the whole of the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the accession process is not just a matter for governments and parliaments. The whole of society will have to change. Therefore, Montenegro must also intensify its dialogue with civil society, the social partners and the trade unions. The freedom of the press must also be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the amendment that I tabled in plenary I call on Montenegro to thoroughly investigate the cases of violence and threats against journalists and to demonstrate its commitment to the freedom of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention equality. There is a great deal to be done if a serious effort is to be made to tackle the problem of women being drastically underrepresented in important positions in Montenegro. This, too, needs to change.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to being able to welcome Montenegro as a Member State of the EU as soon as the accession criteria are met. It is also up to us in the EU to play our part, for example by developing the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance in such a way that it truly provides the support that countries like Montenegro need to be able to adapt to a future in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Tannock, as rapporteur, for his excellent cooperation and, indeed, all the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news for Montenegro and for us is that negotiations will finally begin in early June.</p>
<p class="contents">There are sufficient reasons for us to believe that Montenegro is well prepared. There is also cohesiveness in Montenegrin society about membership of the European Union being an objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Montenegro will be starting with one of the most difficult chapters, Chapter 23, is a positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro has successfully implemented a series of reforms which guarantee the fulfilment of conditions under the acquis. This is true for judicial reform and the creation of effective institutions for combating corruption, which has also attracted the attention of many members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising the positive role of Montenegro in regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, as rapporteur, think that Montenegro’s agreement with Croatia to refer the unresolved issue of Prevlaka to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague shows sound and sensible decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the steps of the Montenegrin Government aimed at ensuring modern and genuine freedom of expression, preventing attacks on journalists and promoting democratic tolerance, when it comes to minorities of all kinds in Montenegrin society.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro is having to deal with some of these issues for the first time, but that is necessary and, certainly, welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the right time for this small and infinitely beautiful country, with a rich history and culture, to make a decisive step towards the united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, I would like to welcome the clear support this Parliament is going to give tomorrow to the European Union starting negotiations with Montenegro. This is an important step forward. It is also one step to keep up this enlargement momentum that we now have with Croatia, with candidate status for Serbia, and with dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia going ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Montenegro is ready and is doing quite well. Many of the amendments that we tabled have been accepted, or have been voted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs: on environment, on large-scale dams. That was very positive, but still there is one thing that is very problematic in Montenegro and that is the corruption problem. It has been addressed by several colleagues, especially concerning the privatisation processes. State-owned companies – aluminium, telecom, electricity – there were large-scale protests just recently in Podgorica against this, and the government really has to look into this and move ahead. In addition, the threats against investigative journalists, mentioned by Mr Färm and also by Commissioner Füle, are not isolated cases and the government really has to step up its support for freedom of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">One last issue: the law on financing of political parties. Implementation of that law has been largely delegated to the State Electoral Commission, and do you know who that is composed of? Representatives of political parties. That is simply not the way to control financing of parties and I think changes are still needed there.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end on a very positive note, on LGBT issues. Here, there has been progress in Montenegro recently and I would like to add one aspect of regional initiatives. Montenegro and the government have just recently held a regional conference on lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender rights with Croatian, Serb and Kosovo representatives. That is a good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we believe that this procedure and accession negotiations should be used as an occasion to resolve economic, social, democratic and human rights problems for the benefit of the people. In this sense, the report contains positive encouragement, especially in terms of establishing a modern, democratic state and combating organised crime. However, there are two points in it which I should like to highlight, given that Montenegro is one of the simplest cases in the Balkans, because we do not agree that such issues should be raised in this manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue is that accession to the European Union and to NATO should be voted on together. As we all know, NATO is a problematic organisation which does not have the best reputation in this particular area, by which I mean the Balkans in general. The second point has to do with the fact that, basically, we are encouraging economic solutions, such as foreign investments and more flexible forms of work (there is high unemployment in Montenegro) which will certainly exacerbate the situation of the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if Montenegro joins on certain conditions, it will bring down the general financial and social level in the European Union. I would have preferred it if these points had been left out of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The backlog of cases in the courts has been reduced and measures to reinforce the independence, accountability and efficiency of judges and prosecutors have been adopted. But these are all on paper and in legislation. Enforcement is the most important element, the key issue and it is the most difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the last 20 years in the post-Communist countries, the most difficult reforms were the reforms of the judiciary and the measures to enforce the fight against corruption. In the area of the fight against corruption, legislation has been reinforced by adopting a new public procurement law, the law on funding political parties and a law on conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, implementation is the key issue and the test of the success of all this adopted legislation. Further efforts are needed to ensure a predictable and efficient judicial system and to restore public trust. Here I would like to give two suggestions: jurisprudence must be unified – justice must not be a lottery – and all judgments must be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against corruption, the Montenegrin authorities must focus on high-level corruption cases. This is the test of the judiciary and of the political class. We need, and the people of Montenegro need, a strong and convincing track record of final convictions in high-level political cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the oldest modern state in the Balkans. As well as having a strong Slav culture and also a strong Albanian culture, it is a place where Christians and Muslims can come together. The minorities there have traditionally been given very good protection. This means that despite the many outstanding problems, Montenegro is in my opinion still on the right track and needs considerable support from us. This is why I welcome Mr Tannock’s excellent report and why I believe that the presence of a Montenegrin Commissioner and Montenegrin Members of the European Parliament would enrich the European Union. The country could become something like the Luxembourg of the Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am confident that this resolution sends the right message to Montenegro: one of both acknowledgement of the hard work delivered so far and strong encouragement to pursue the reform process with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro is very close to opening accession negotiations. I am positive that, with the strong commitment of its people and our joint support, Montenegro will continue to set a positive example in the region by moving ahead in its European integration efforts. In line with the recent European Council conclusions, the Commission will present an interim report this spring on Montenegro’s progress in the implementation of reforms, in particular in the area of rule of law and fundamental rights. The report will especially look into continued progress on the seven key priorities since the adoption of our 2011 progress report. Should the report indicate further progress, the launching of accession talks by the Council in June would confirm the credibility of the enlargement process as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a future and an aspiration that is now within reach. In Montenegro there is broad national agreement on the desire for EU membership, and it is impressive how far Montenegro has come in a short space of time in its efforts to draw closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as a member of the Danish Presidency, I visited the country myself on 21 February this year. Whilst there, I saw a strong commitment on the part of Montenegro and a willingness to make reforms. In a short space of time, Montenegro has implemented many important reforms, including ones to develop a more effective rule of law and to safeguard citizens’ fundamental rights. These are reforms that are in the interests of both Montenegro and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is fine, but there is still a need for progress, particularly with regard to combating corruption and organised crime. In this regard, I look forward to the Commission’s next progress report, which will evaluate the many reform initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate today we have touched on a number of the areas in which reform is required. There is broad agreement between the EU and Montenegro on which areas it is relevant to continue to work on, which I am pleased about. Montenegro’s future reform work should focus in particular on completing the constitutional reform, combating organised crime and corruption and effectively implementing the legislation that has been adopted, namely in areas such as the financing of political parties and anti-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I look forward to the completion of the work on the constitutional reform, which will increase the independence of the judiciary. The forthcoming reforms will, without doubt, shape citizens’ day-to-day lives and place considerable demands on them. In this regard, it is important that the country’s administrative capacity continues to be increased. One way this can be done is with a contribution from the EU’s Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance, which up to now has been used to good effect in Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">With a small and open economy, Montenegro has also been hit by the crisis, and, like other places in Europe, it has the prospect of low economic growth and unemployment. For this reason, too, it is important for Montenegro to implement a policy that will promote growth conditions for the corporate sector. Montenegro has already made progress towards establishing a market economy, and further reforms will reinforce this development.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Montenegro will continue to do its best to fulfil its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Progress in terms of EU integration is, as we all know, based on merit. I am pleased that Montenegro has already succeeded in meeting a good number of the accession criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">When the countries involved in the EU integration process deliver, the EU must do the same. It is my hope that, during the Danish Presidency, we will be able to open accession negotiations with Montenegro in June. Of course, the progress we expect in connection with Montenegro’s EU integration will first and foremost benefit Montenegro itself, but I am convinced that this progress will also help to provide positive momentum for the efforts of the other countries in the Western Balkans to draw near to the EU. This matter is therefore important for Montenegro, the Balkans and the EU. It is a matter on which the Danish Presidency will work closely with Parliament and the Commission in order to achieve the results that we all agree we want to see, for the benefit of Montenegro and of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are also a number of issues that Podgorica authorities have a duty to handle with utmost seriousness. I mean, primarily, the need to combat organised crime and respect the freedom of the press. Objective and timely investigations are necessary in all cases of attacks on journalists. We are also worried by the serious under-representation of women in decision-making positions and by the violation of women’s employment rights. These are obvious expressions of violation of gender equality. Last but not least, Montenegro is required to implement sustainable solutions for the problems of the 15 000 refugees on its territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
