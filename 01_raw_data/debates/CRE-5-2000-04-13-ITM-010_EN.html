On the other hand, whilst the accession of the candidate countries will give more young people access to the YOUTH programme and there will be an even richer exchange of experience, I have some doubts about whether the budget for the programme is enough to guarantee the success of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the initial phase of this programme has been positive, its scope is very limited, as it relates to just one facet of the youth policy that we need, which should actually tackle the various issues affecting young people – such as education, employment, housing, health and culture – across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The references to ways of solving the problems of discrimination and to the age range for participation in the programme – 15-25, although there are some exceptions – are also inadequate, given that the average age for completing higher education is very close to the upper limit, which should be raised to 30 years.</p>

<p class="contents">The previous youth programmes, Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service, will be grouped together in a general medium-term programme which will run from 2000 until 2006, as the European Parliament has demanded. A longer-term programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time. Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security, therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement, there will be a possibility of increasing this figure, following extra demands on the budget by enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">These programmes will certainly benefit our young people and give them invaluable opportunities to learn about themselves, about others and about Europe. Not only is this crucial for their personal development, but in a fiercely competitive world it will vastly improve their chances on the job market. Increasing our young people's skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Our young people are Europe's future. We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union, as well as developing their own values, ideas and skills. It is important that they are able to participate in voluntary work abroad, school exchanges and learning languages.

We believe that it is a magnificent initiative on a European level to dedicate a special year to languages in Europe, to knowledge of them and to the recognition throughout the whole of the European Union of the importance of languages as a reservoir of cultural and historical wealth and an expression of the very identity of the societies which make up the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have supported this report but there are two aspects which we are not happy with. I am referring to some amendments which we have presented, both on behalf of the Liberal Group as well as the group of MEPs headed by Mrs Ferrer, in order to incorporate in a clear and specific way the official languages which are recognised in the Member States so that they may participate directly and in an institutional sense in the development of the European Year of Languages. This amendment has not been taken up, and we regret the line followed by the European Commission, with the participation of the Member States, because it leaves aside, at risk of marginalising it, a form of participation which is particularly important in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that this Parliament recognised Catalan as a European language and gave it a specific personality. It is this language, together with others, which must be taken into account in the application and celebration of this European Year of Languages.</p>

<p class="contents">In a European Union of fifteen Member States, committed to enlargement, with eleven official languages and a multitude of regional languages, it is actually very important to make the citizens of the Union aware of the advantages of understanding and speaking other languages and of the many opportunities that exist for learning to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking a language other than one’s mother tongue undoubtedly broadens the mind. So, from primary school and kindergarten, children should be encouraged to start learning languages, as an instrument to raise awareness of cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Some European countries, especially the Scandinavian countries, already have very advanced policies in this field and the resulting advantages are evident. This practice needs to be disseminated to the other Member States. Of course, we must ensure that this knowledge is not confined only to the better off in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Boosting the learning of foreign languages will bring European citizens closer together by giving them the means to communicate, and thus get to know each other and forge the links to make the concept of European citizenship a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up to other cultures and finding out about the traditions of our European neighbours are essential ways of combating intolerance and racism engendered by fear of the unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">At the practical level, it needs to be made clear that the European Year of Languages is in fact a joint European Union/Council of Europe project. To show that, it would be better for the two partners to use an identical logo and slogan. The same concern for visibility and transparency leads me to support the creation of an interactive Internet site so that people can access useful information about the project.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of people being multilingual, but I am sorry we are not trying to develop the teaching of Esperanto in parallel. It is a language with European roots and easy to understand, but also rich and subtle. As an auxiliary language, it can provide one means, amongst others, of facilitating communication between all European citizens. I therefore regret that it is not mentioned in this proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the frame of this European Year, most of the amendments aim to establish closer cooperation with the Member States at all levels of policy, not only at national level but also at regional and even local policy level. An essential requirement for this is that the Member States earmark sufficient funds to set up activities that can then be cofinanced by the European Union. If not, the European Year of Languages is likely to remain a PR exercise, just a lot of hot air.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aim of my amendments was by means of the activities set up in the context of this European Year to pay special attention to socially vulnerable groups, migrants and semi-skilled and unskilled workers. This is something very close to my heart: learning to have an active command of foreign languages should not become the umpteenth barrier to the integration of this target group, a privilege for the already privileged members of our society. Foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration.</p>
<p class="contents">A third series of amendments that I have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective Member States. It is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one Member State to another. Smaller Member States with a correspondingly small language area must <span class="italic">ipso facto</span> make much greater effort, whereas in the larger Member States and larger language areas respectively the economic incentive is not so great. The Member States are therefore inherently asymmetrical in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will endorse this initiative and that we shall be able to start the specific activities as soon as possible, because there is a lot to be done.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their banana war is just one aspect and, like banana production, just one factor in a complex of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">This war, which is presented as a conflict between producer countries, Latin American and dollar area countries against Lomé Convention countries and European overseas dependent territories, is actually a war between capitalist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Three large American capitalist groups, including Chiquita, the new name for the notorious United Fruit, dominate the dollar banana and are supported by the American Government. </p>
<p class="contents">Behind the producer countries the European Union is claiming to protect, however, there are some large families of wealthy French-Creoles and, indeed, powerful English and French groups.</p>

<p class="contents">We demand protection for agricultural labourers, who should not be the victims of the commercial war raging on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">If a guarantee fund is created, it must underwrite the wages of these workers and the incomes of small producers, and not allow banana magnates to increase their wealth just to invest it in other, more profitable, sectors.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the WTO’s dispute settlement body condemned certain key elements in the competitivity of ACP operators, the validity of the principle of tariff quotas has not been challenged in any way. The fact is that we are, as is often the case, witnessing the overzealousness of the Commission which, in the context of the negotiations initiated within the WTO, has gone too far. In attempting to reconcile the contradictory interests of all parties, in the end it has not been able, or has not wished, to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore seems curious, to say the least, to note the paradox of acknowledging that operators are all in favour of a tariff quota system, while adopting the solution of a single rate system!</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore congratulate Mr Dary and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are attempting to restore a little order to the Commission proposal which we find simply unacceptable as it stands, because it is selling off Community interests for the benefit of American multinationals whose manufacturing standards are obviously not comparable with EU standards. While it may, admittedly, be quite laudable to seek to obtain the most advantageous prices for consumers, we must still be able to compare like with like, particularly in terms of manufacturing conditions (social legislation, child protection).</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore ensure that we do not tend towards harmonising these social conditions of manufacturing to the lowest common denominator, and, instead, let us pursue, as a priority, the objective of better product quality, without GMOs or pesticides or anything else. Developing better quality products will cause a consequent increase in demand, and thus in the volume of production, with a concomitant reduction in prices!</p>
<p class="contents">After years of difficulty due to the economic crisis in industrialised countries and the decline in the economies of Eastern Europe, the Commission’s solution would be likely to cause the untimely disappearance of these producing countries whose economies would not, for want of time, be able to restructure and diversify production. It is clear today that, without actively seeking confrontation, the EU must champion its own point of view, a position which is all the more tenable as present and future European consumers represent a major proportion of the banana market.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore satisfied with Mr Dary’s report, even if we feel it does not go far enough, particularly in terms of the ACP tariff system, the transition period extended beyond ten years, and the definition of a new system for the allocation of import licences, or additional European aid.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People are always saying that South-Eastern Europe is the European Union’s crisis-riven back yard. The political context in this region is extremely sensitive and came to a climax in the Kosovo conflict. That conflict demonstrated the potential political effects of instability on the neighbouring States, threatening to destabilise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania and Montenegro. Other countries in the region like Bulgaria and Romania have also suffered serious economic repercussions. It is easy to see that the European Union has every interest in the stabilisation of the region and that interest will grow with future enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was traumatised by its powerlessness in the face of the process of violent disintegration at work in the Balkans. It was incapable of doing anything likely to stop that disintegration because it lacked a common political will for action, but it also lacked a political approach and appropriate instruments which would have allowed it to manage the crisis effectively at the international level. It can be said that the Balkan crisis was a turning point which had the effect of stamping a decisive orientation on European defence and security policy. The decisions of the European Councils of Cologne and Helsinki on creating military and civilian capabilities for independent European Union crisis management are proof of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the Cologne Council was the establishment of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe on 10 June 1999, a pact involving not only the Member States of the European Union and, of course, the countries of the region, but also the United States and Russia. The pact is part of the global stabilisation approach the European Union has been developing since 1996. The stabilisation and association agreements to be signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are the keystone of that approach. Negotiations are currently taking place with Macedonia. Croatia, where positive political changes have recently occurred, should be involved in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements constitute an entirely new contractual framework for the countries of the region; they draw great inspiration from the institutional arrangements and conditions attached to the European agreements linking the European Union with the CEECs. These agreements are individually tailored to take account of the specific situation in each country. They hold out the prospect of long-term integration into the European Union on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. Above all, they give the countries of this crisis-riven region an important political signal and a definite incentive. These agreements also encourage stronger regional cooperation, which seems to me indispensable to the creation of an axis of stability in the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have not been able to vote for it because it still contains inconsistencies after the plenary vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, as regards the idea of the creation of a commission for stock exchange operations, I recommend a green paper on the establishment or gradual creation of such a commission, preceded by a feasibility study. Moreover, the subsidiarity principle requires that, at a time of remarkable boom in the craze for cross-border investments in securities, we bear in mind that the interests of the issuing companies and investors will be better served by proximity of supervision and monitoring of international investments, with more efficient channels for cooperation between the monitoring authorities. Supervision of the securities markets can be carried out better by people close to the markets and with in-depth knowledge of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, comparison with the commission in place in the United States, the SEC, is particularly inappropriate, because the SEC is the corollary of a financial system resulting largely from a segmentation of the profession between commercial banks and investment banks, and in Europe we have chosen the universal bank model, which has strengthened the role of the banks in the European financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be equally aberrant to include the stock exchange listing rules in the remit of such a commission, when at most it should ensure respect for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a pan-European equity listing would also be aberrant. Harmonised yet competitive listings guarantee a diversity of investment products. A pan-European listing would make it impossible for national stock exchanges to concentrate on niche markets and would restrict opportunities for specialisation which may emerge from a competitive situation, even though it is convergent. Instead of focusing on the listings – already largely harmonised anyway – to the detriment of diversity, we should emphasise rapprochement or even harmonisation of existing dealing systems and environments should be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">On prudential supervision, I made a direct appeal to the Commission and the Council yesterday not to cling to the crazy idea of entrusting supervision of all the credit establishments in the fifteen Member States to the European Central Bank. Governments control banking activities, hence the need for financial sector supervision by government authorities, not the European Central Bank. I have not voted for paragraph 26 which is mostly incomprehensible in French anyway.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that the future of pensioners can only lie in supplementary pensions. These pensions should, however, be optional and replace compulsory State pensions, which are a veritable sieve and lose water from all sides. When we cook spaghetti, which is a delicious Italian national dish, we use a colander, a container full of holes which drains the water off the spaghetti. Well, instead of a colander, we could use the national State schemes, which, I am afraid, also lose water from all sides, except that, instead of water, it is the hard-earned money of all the working citizens which drains away. For this reason, we must replace the national State pension schemes with private supplementary and alternative pension schemes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The committee expressed an opinion on the outcome of the consultation on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market, just as it did on the Green Paper itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe this very broad consultation should rapidly conclude with a proposal for a framework directive to ensure the development of a genuine single market in supplementary pension funds, under the second and third pillars. The first pillar, covering biometric risks, must still continue to be the cornerstone of social protection in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The targeted directive we are seeking for the second pillar of supplementary pensions should, in particular, define the context for eliminating obstacles to free choice of pension fund, free movement of persons, free provision of services and double taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards taxation, the only acceptable solution is one based on the principle that contributions should be tax deductible, at least up to a certain ceiling, and that supplementary pensions paid out should be taxable in accordance with the income tax legislation applying in the countries of residence. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the controversial question of whether supplementary pension systems should cover biometric risks, I want to point out that, from the fiscal point of view, pension funds which do not cover these risks cannot be discriminated against as compared with those which do cover them, it being understood that the need to cover these risks depends on the extent of the first pillar in the various countries. Subsidiarity and free choice require this.</p>
<p class="contents">Prudential rules must not be disproportionate to ensuring that the funds are secure. They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise. They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of agreement on certain essential points, I am unable to vote for the general framework. I regret this all the more as almost all the relevant conclusions from the Committee on Women’s Rights and my recommendations are included in the motion for a resolution, in particular those considering that</p>
<p class="contents">- as regards supplementary pensions too, the preservation of acquired rights is essential when a spouse interrupts or abandons his or her work in order to devote himself or herself to his or her family or look after close relatives who are in need of assistance;</p>
<p class="contents">- for the purpose of calculating pensions, certain periods devoted to the upbringing of children or care of family members ought to be taken into account;</p>
<p class="contents">- it is desirable to provide for the possibility of continued voluntary or optional insurance to preserve and improve pension rights and guarantee a right to payment of the capital under certain conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should obviously take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Member States to implement more consistently the principle of equal pay for equal work, because wage discrimination against women has repercussions on women’s pension levels. Any legal or contractual provisions infringing the principle of equality of treatment of men and women should be invalid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to reiterate my long-standing demand – disregarded by the Commission for many years – for revision of the existing directives on equality of treatment of women and men in terms of social security, in the same way as it applies in legal and professional systems. And let us not forget assisting spouses, those millions of invisible workers, the large majority women, on whose behalf this Parliament has demanded an upgrading of the half-hearted 1986 directive to give assisting spouses proper status and compulsory membership of social security schemes, especially pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 March President Prodi and seven of his colleagues met with members of the Committee on Women’s Rights, the European Women’s Lobby and the Equal Opportunities Consultative Committee. I hope he and the committee responsible will now stop ignoring those demands of the European Parliament I have just mentioned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does the European Parliament report support this approach, it also calls for the relevant measures to be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for the proposed objectives are what are typically referred to as the ‘enormous benefits’ of the internal market. However, no explanation is given as to who will benefit from, and who will suffer under, this procedure. Without doubt, the only outcome of all the measures to implement the principles of free establishment and free provision of services, the measures to liberalise the markets, the measures to promote the free movement of goods and the numerous concomitant laws is to strengthen the huge multinationals whose potential to extend and mobilise on new markets at greatly reduced costs has been facilitated and which have benefited from deregulation measures. These multinationals have seen their profits increase and their position consolidated. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to small- or medium-sized businesses in small Member States, where much stiffer competition has resulted in an increase in the number of bankruptcies, shrinking business and job cuts. The problem for these companies is not, of course, that they are ‘hampered in exploiting the opportunities afforded by the internal market’; their problem is precisely the measures used to implement the internal market, the principles which constitute the EU's competition legislation and the reduction in demand in the middle and lower classes as the result of anti-grass roots austerity policies. And, of course, the solution does not lie in venture capital and the financial markets, which increase the risks for most small businesses, due to their limited resources, but in a different economic development policy which supports productive investment, increases demand and makes it easier for small businesses to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for new, improved arrangements for companies by ‘simplifying the legal, administrative and fiscal environment’ and for ‘laws… which do not involve costs and other burdens for businesses which would otherwise lose their competitive advantage over foreign competitors’. In other words, even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications. At the same time, there is not a word about workers’ rights, about the fact that fewer obstacles mean less protection under labour legislation and less accountability during mass redundancies, mergers and transfers. It is not by chance that neither the individual Commission proposals nor the European Council guidelines make any reference to the need to limit these phenomena, control speculative movements of capital and impose a tax and other measures on capital. The report calls for greater liberalisation of sectors such as the pharmaceutical market and a reduction in the tax burden on employment, thereby proving that the measures being taken are paving the way for greater liberalisation of and less accountable capital transactions and profits with exceptionally dangerous consequences for the entire social protection system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report under discussion is fully in line with the anti-grass roots economic and social policy exercised within the framework of the single internal market and EMU and we shall, of course, be voting against it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of the success of earlier campaigns on the euro, the results of these are still to be established. This is another illustration of the ‘soviet-style’ procedures of the Community institutions which are now trying to invent the new consumer and the new businessman, after the new citizen of the Ludford report.</p>
<p class="contents">So while the rapporteur supports companies, especially when faced with the difficulties SMEs encounter because of ‘administrative obstacles’ and complexities, I have considerable reservations about certain provisions in the final text. The report underlines the vital importance of making infringement procedures faster and more efficient and ‘welcomes the proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference’ along those lines. Because Community centralisation is failing to demonstrate its validity and its contribution, we are now forced to insist on repressive procedures, where cooperation would have made it possible to draw up flexible rules more easily acceptable to those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, the Commission should, and I quote, ‘pay special attention to creating internal-market mindedness’ in national governments, ‘while monitoring national implementing measures’. When we know the political context surrounding officials in Community institutions, this desire to brainwash officials in our governments alarms me. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report regrets that the advantage to businesses of treating the whole of the EU as a single market rather than as a collection of national markets is not always apparent to them. To remedy this lack of awareness which is additional to administrative obstacles and consumer behaviour, the report envisages ‘mass information campaigns similar to those conducted in the case of the euro and incentives to encourage the private sector not to treat partners from other Member States unfavourably’.</p>
<p class="contents">These points do not seem to undermine the confidence of this House in the chosen Community construction model. People are going to be made happy, whether they like it or not.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
