<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this important proposal to Parliament. It forms part of our policy of giving transport a human face, in other words, looking after citizens’ rights, passengers’ rights, as we announced in our White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult for passengers to accept being denied boarding. They have paid for their ticket, reserved their seat and arrived at the airport in time for check-in only to be told that there are no seats on the plane, because the airline has overbooked or simply that some other hitch has occurred. This is incomprehensible to members of the public and causes major disruption and feelings of frustration and finally, of resentment. Every year, within the Community, around 250 000 people – having paid for their ticket and completed all the formalities – are denied boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it acknowledged that the airlines needed flexibility in order to manage capacity, the European Community adopted in 1991 – on the eve of the adoption of final legislation on liberalisation – a Regulation on denied boarding due to overbooking which guarantees the passengers affected financial compensation and assistance, but which is extremely limited. The Commission has therefore proposed a new regulation in order considerably to reduce the number of people denied boarding and to improve protection for those concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">When airlines plan to deny boarding, they shall be obliged, first of all, to ask for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for specified benefits; they may only deny boarding to passengers against their will if there are not enough volunteers. In order for the Regulation to be effective, however, it must provide a powerful incentive for people to volunteer. We have therefore proposed a significant increase in compensation, above the current levels, which have partly been absorbed by inflation and which these days do not dissuade airlines from denying boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, when the airlines manage to find volunteers, they will not pay this compensation. The Commission’s position is flexible with regard to the exact amounts, provided that they are substantial enough to encourage the airlines to find volunteers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal will also eliminate the restrictions of the current Regulation. First of all, it will extend the rights of passengers who are denied boarding to all passengers whose flights are cancelled. Ultimately, cancellation equates to universal denied boarding for an entire flight. Only cancellations for which the corresponding airline is responsible would be covered, however, because, obviously, in some circumstances, it would be unfair for the airline to bear sole responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposed Regulation will establish fundamental rights for passengers who suffer delays, allowing them to organise their journey by other means, instead of waiting indefinitely at the airport. In this case, however, they would not be entitled to compensation. Lastly, our proposal will grant all of these rights to passengers flying on both scheduled and charter flights. Passengers on package holidays will therefore benefit in the same way as those who only buy a plane ticket. It would not be fair to treat passengers differently when they have to face similar difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the essential points of our proposal, which substantially increases protection for passengers in the event of problems with their flights and which aims to significantly improve the quality of service and therefore increase guarantees for citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this difficult time for the civil aviation sector, whose future we debated recently in this Chamber when we discussed the single European sky rules, the European Commission has proposed a new regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the air transport sector has brought numerous benefits for passengers. Competition has arrived on many routes, causing a fall in prices and a great increase in the choice of routes and destinations. In spite of this, however, consumers have valid reasons for dissatisfaction. Denied boarding and cancellation of flights provoke strong resentment, and the assistance provided during the excessive delays all too often leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House fly so often that many of us have experienced such inconveniences, and it is therefore very easy for us to put ourselves in the shoes of the citizens in this case and understand that new, effective legislation is needed to protect their rights across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the shortcomings of current legislation, the European Commission proposes to take a different approach, introducing, on the one hand, a call for volunteers, as per the effective US system, and, on the other, a dissuasive system which compels airlines to provide greater compensation to passengers for damages. In addition, protection is considerably increased, as we will see in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, lose sight of the overall context of this proposal. We have had the opportunity to pursue an extremely constructive debate in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, exploring all aspects of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has just pointed out, overbooking, the principal cause of denied boarding, is a negligible consideration when seen against the backdrop of the annual flow of air passengers in the Community area. We cannot risk penalising the entire spectrum of travellers with a potential blanket price increase in order to provide greater protection for a very small number of passengers. We must be very careful and identify precisely the best solutions for achieving the objective without causing repercussions, bearing in mind, not least, the economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Commissioner, I am afraid I must complain of the lack of statistics provided by the Commission in support of the proposal. We do need practical statistics and facts on which to base a decision, and the lack thereof has certainly made it quite difficult for me to draw up a report.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now outline the principal points on which we have worked to produce the final document. The first is the definitions. In terms of methodology, I believe it is essential to define all the actors involved and terms used more precisely, to avoid any confusion which might affect either passengers or airlines. To this end, a number of amendments have been adopted seeking to make the provisions of Article 2 more detailed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns tour operators. Passengers who have bought a package holiday are already more than adequately protected by Directive 90/314. The Commission’s proposal is therefore in danger of creating confusion over the reference text, to the detriment, principally, of the passengers, and it was therefore necessary to restrict the responsibility of tour operators in the context of this regulation to seats only, as we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the most controversial point: the provision of compensation to passengers in the event of denied boarding. The Commission’s proposal has given rise to a great deal of debate and much concern. Neither the criteria established for the definition of the new compensation amounts nor the impact assessment satisfy the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. As far as we are concerned, the important thing is to preserve a balance between protecting passengers and the vitality of a major economic sector such as the air transport sector. We have therefore proposed a three-category division on the basis of distance and a reduction in compensation amounts. Indeed, we must remember that we should be concentrating more on implementing the system of calls for volunteers than on compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I believe it is entirely inappropriate to extend the provision of compensation to excessive delays, for a number of reasons. First of all, because it is not easy to identify the cause of the delay quickly enough, and, secondly, because this would create a chain reaction. We therefore feel it is entirely appropriate to equate denied boarding with cancellation, but we feel it is inappropriate to treat excessive delays in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather, we must ensure that a proper, systematic system of assistance in the event of delays is in operation, particularly where people with disabilities or minors are concerned, as regards both the provision of information and logistics, and we have adopted a number of amendments to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say, by way of conclusion, a quick word about the amendments tabled. They show that the debate on compensation amounts between those who would like them to be higher and those who would like them to be lower is still ongoing. Certainly, at the moment, the only reaction is a certain amount of dissatisfaction regarding our proposal on the part of both airlines and consumers, and this, Commissioner, allows me to hope that, precisely because no party is satisfied, the compromise we have reached is the most balanced and most intelligent solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While he was drafting it, he attended the discussions on my opinion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and incorporated many of the points raised. Our differences are really minor, but I will return to them. As Mr Lisi said, Members pontificate here on many subjects about which they have an imperfect knowledge, but we all regard ourselves as experts on the problems of passenger travel. They dominate our working lives. So there was a warm welcome for Commissioner de Palacio's proposals to move ahead from the 1991 regulations, not just on denied boarding but on delayed and cancelled flights as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no dispute that what we call the hierarchy of remedies must apply, starting with compensation levels proportionate to the distance travelled. I think most of the airlines have responded well to this debate, with the air service passenger commitment as a gesture of intent. I would say to those maverick airlines that ignore all that – and we know where they fly to, if not always where they live – that they would be wise to heed the public mood. No frills should not mean no concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we are offered an amendment to Article 7 which called for levels of compensation to be based on specific impact assessments, so that it could not be argued that they were frivolously levied. I must say that the levels of compensation in Mr Lisi's report are well beyond what we wanted under Article 7. We wanted mandatory compensation of between EUR 300 and EUR 1 500, subject to distance and review. That has fallen to between EUR 200 and 600, but I accept that in itself is progress for the consumer. I am still concerned that this does not necessarily apply under Amendment No 31, which refers back to Article 9 and not Article 8. Perhaps the Commissioner can assure me that those amendments will actually apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, Mr Lisi and his committee have advanced the consumer cause and have allowed us to move forward to a system of airline ranking. If only this applied to all airlines, all flights and all problems. Every day further horrors come to light. On a British airline, a woman had to endure an 11-hour flight next to a 23-stone woman who sat on her, not next to her, throughout the flight. She was left with serious injuries and initially offered GBP 15 compensation. You might say that the airline began with one handicapped passenger and ended with two. Our journeys should be reducing handicaps, not increasing them. I welcome this report as a step in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to support the comments he has made.</p>
<p class="contents">As a general observation, and taking issue with the Commission position, I would like to continue by saying that this report came as an unwelcome surprise, not least because, last year, a report on air passenger rights was taken through committee by Mr Collins, with Parliament overwhelmingly supporting a voluntary approach. In addition, there has been no industry consultation on this issue and no business impact assessment of value. There is no data on the projected costs to carriers; no assessment of the impact on competitiveness – between both EU and other carriers; and no information on the direct and consequential impact of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The voluntary air passenger service commitment agreement was signed in February in Strasbourg. Virtually all the European airlines were party to it. It included references to a number of points contained in this proposal on delays, cancellations and diversions, special needs passengers, reducing the number of involuntary denied boardings and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">So why did Mr Collins and our committee go to the trouble of taking his report through Parliament when the Commission clearly had a legislative proposal in its back pocket? The voluntary agreement has not failed; it has not even had a chance to work. Here we are again with the Commission knocking another nail into the coffin.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is flawed in several key areas: it fails to recognise fundamental differences between scheduled and charter operations; it ignores, for example, the package travel directive covering the rights of charter passengers. In particular, it concerns proposals on cancellations and long delays, hence the inclusion of the tour operators, as supported by our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also ignored the proportion of events due to failures within the monopoly providers such as ATC and airports, and the inability of airlines to obtain compensation from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the ticket price has gone down in the last ten years, the increase in compensation levels proposed for denied boarding by the Commission is an incredible 400%. Left at those levels, this regulation would cost the scheduled carriers somewhere in the region of EUR 1.35 billion. The many regional and low-cost airlines would be more critically affected, as their margins are much smaller. In addition, none of these rules will apply to third country airlines. We in Europe will again suffer the consequences of an unlevel playing field – another example of the Commission taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, under the leadership of our rapporteur, we have achieved a more sensible and realistic conclusion. I live in hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament and act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The public quite rightly expects and deserves good customer service but this proposal is a step too far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, the compromise that was struck in the committee constitutes a significant step towards greater consumer protection. At long last we have legal security on additional issues and not just voluntary commitments from the airlines. Moreover, the regulation is of course also being extended to cover severe delays and flight cancellations. I was not infrequently the victim of cancellations by the former airline Sabena. No doubt other Members have had similar experiences with other airlines. Last but not least we are doubling the current levels of compensation, which will also be more subtly differentiated than hitherto and divided into three bands.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the issue that we most need to discuss is the level of compensation. The objective of the regulation cannot be to abolish the practice of overbooking, but it can be to ensure that this procedure is used in a more reasonable, customer-oriented way. Of course, we could also eliminate overbooking, as the low-cost carriers have done, if, on the other hand, flights were non-exchangeable and a no-show meant that a flight was automatically forfeited. But this is neither consumer-friendly nor justifiable on environmental grounds. Consumers need flexibility when they are planning their journeys and half-empty planes make no sense at all from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic argument is even more persuasive. If overbooking were abolished, air prices would inevitably rise and we cannot expect either consumers to put up with this or indeed the airlines, which are up against international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">A further reason why we can support the compromise struck in the committee on compensation levels is because we think it is important for consumers to benefit from these improved and binding rules as quickly as possible and not have to wait for them for years because the legislation is, as is so often the case, still sitting in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of consumers, my group will be voting against part of Amendment No 29, because we think that compensation only for flights that are cancelled up to 48 hours before departure is unreasonable. At least two weeks is required here and this should be negotiated afterwards with the Council and the Commission. In addition, we think that the inclusion of package tours in the Commission proposal is unnecessary, because they are covered by the directive on package tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has advocated the introduction of a scheme to rank airlines by user-friendliness is a strong vote in favour of the consumer. A ranking system of this kind, as is quite usual in the USA, can help to stimulate competition between the airlines on quality and on which provides the most consumer-friendly overall service. I hope that this proposal is also upheld in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the current situation, this report represents a determined step towards greater consumer-friendliness. Many a consumer dream may fly on, but they are hopelessly overbooked.</p>

It was high time to draw up better regulations, particularly with regard to overbooking. In my opinion, however, the Commission proposal is seriously lacking when it comes to flight cancellations and delays. In this context, the airline companies are being held responsible for a problem that is overwhelmingly caused by air traffic control and the aviation authorities. My objections are based on the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is not based on a proper evaluation of the economic effect, and it has not considered the consequences of the measure for the sector and in particular for ticket prices. Although it provides increased protection, the proposal will limit the consumer’s free choice. The definition of a superior power or force majeure, given by both the Commission and our own Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, does not contain enough certainty to be able to properly distinguish between delays and flight cancellations which fall outside the responsibility of the airline companies. It can be argued that the airline companies ought to recover the damage from the appropriate party themselves, but that is not feasible in practice. Where we are talking about regional or low-cost airlines, it would probably be preferable to let consumers themselves choose whether to pay a premium above the price of the ticket. They could probably then cover themselves against flight cancellations. This option could easily be introduced by the sector itself. I have a couple of remaining questions for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission confirm that it intends to carry out a thorough economic analysis of the consequences and the effects of its proposal, of the increasing costs for the airline companies and of the new flight tariffs in the different segments of the aviation market? Can the Commission confirm that it intends to investigate the real reasons for flight cancellations and delays, so that we can have a better understanding of which causes are indeed the responsibility of the airline companies and which are not? Has the Commission also considered other policy measures which might ensure better rights for passengers than the ones presently included in their proposal? Travel insurance aimed specifically at flight delays and cancellations might be a possible solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had further debates and further discussions here in Parliament. My amendments are a necessary supplementary measure intended to provide a decent balance between ticket price and compensation. The first amendment relates to denied boarding and flight cancellations. I propose a supplementary measure to the sound compromise, i.e. that there should be a different arrangement for an additional category of tickets below EUR 200. This applies to both denied boarding and cancellation. The other amendment relates to incoming flights, to which Mrs Foster referred and does exactly what she wants. This is exactly what my amendment is about, and I look forward to your support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being squashed into an aircraft like sardines is also a fairly recent phenomenon. I therefore think that you are right to say that measures need to be taken urgently. I personally would like to see all these malpractices banned, but I realise that such drastic action is not practicable. In any case, the compensation the companies have to pay must be high enough to act as a deterrent – particularly where the airlines can rely on a system of volunteers, which should not really be so appealing as to encourage overbooking. I hope that you will take another look at our amendments, which aim at increasing the actual compensation sums and introducing a system of classification. I can only remind you of the number of times we seasoned fliers have all arrived at our destination after a flight only to find our luggage is not there. What company is still customer-friendly in such circumstances? If this cannot be done in a separate amendment, I should like to ask Mr Lisi whether he might be able to include this classification in his report, although that will be every 5 years. I hope that this type of compensation will eventually be introduced for train passengers as well, and indeed for all individuals who are the victims of high prices and poor service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal has a clear two-pronged approach. It firstly calls on the airlines to use the volunteering principle, whereby the airline makes offers to individuals to identify those who do not urgently have to take the next flight, but could also take the one after that. It is true that experience in America with the volunteering system has been positive. If there are not enough volunteers, however, and everyone wants to go home or to their business appointment and passengers are denied boarding, then they must have some legal redress. They have booked a flight, they have an OK on their ticket and they therefore have a right to board. If the airline overbooks in its own economic interests, because it knows that there are a lot of no-shows, then it must pay if it cannot uphold the booking. It is as simple as that. Because if passengers have an OK on their ticket they have the certainty that they can travel, and if they cannot then the carrier has to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you were, of course, a little harsh about the level of the payments. My colleague, Mrs Foster, with whom I do not always agree, said something that is very true. Air prices have fallen in recent years and that is why the argument that we should set compensation very high, so as to take account of recent cost increases, is clearly flawed, because air prices have fallen. Most of us in any case are familiar with the ingenious system of special tariffs, which mean that you can easily fly at more reasonable prices than those prescribed. With this in mind, please understand that we have reduced the compensation to a level that we deem to be economically fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that if excessive compensation is paid to passengers who are not taken on board, the carriers will pass on these costs to all passengers, and then general price levels will rise, which will affect more people than those denied boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Members of the Liberal Group – we usually see eye to eye, but today, exceptionally, we do not – that we have to set a flat rate of compensation for two reasons: firstly, the prejudice suffered by anyone who is denied boarding is always the same, whether they have paid EUR 150, EUR 500 or more for their ticket. They have been given a guarantee that they will fly and they are left behind. It is completely irrelevant how much the ticket cost. Their confidence has been damaged, and more besides. That is why I believe that the low-cost carriers, which actually do not have any problems with overbooking because they do not accept more passengers than have booked, should also compensate passengers for any injury caused if they cancel a flight for economic reasons, and they obviously do this from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">We need uniform tariffs so as to make the job of the poor airport staff easier. You see, if a passenger is denied boarding or a flight is cancelled, we want the compensation to be paid at the gate. You really cannot expect the poor flight attendant to calculate thousands of prices and people to wait until she has calculated the individual compensation entitlements. I therefore believe that our proposal is quite sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who is unfortunately unable to speak this evening and who has asked me to make some points for her, I should like to refer once again to the split vote that we are proposing on Article 3(2). This states that the regulation does not apply to passengers travelling at a reduced fare which is not available directly or indirectly to the public. We fear that this wording is very vague. We should state quite clearly that a passenger travelling at a reduced fare also has a right to full compensation. I believe that it is very important that the provision is interpreted in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you one more question. As you know, Mr Lisi has made a very good proposal on Article 13, namely that the Member States have to ensure that if a carrier pays compensation and is not in actual fact responsible for the delay or cancellation it may have recourse to those responsible, whether it be air traffic control or other bodies, including state-owned systems. With a view to ensuring fair burden-sharing, can you assure us that, if we make the airlines responsible for paying compensation in the first place, they will also be able to have recourse to any state-owned organisations that have caused the delay or cancellation? You would assist us greatly if you were to support this portion of our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, lower prices and greater demand have not put an end to consumer complaints, as we all know. As some Members have already said, we are seeing cancelled or delayed flights, passengers being denied boarding, problems with baggage and so on. This is unacceptable! In order better to protect consumers, the liberalisation of air transport requires better market management and rationalisation. The harmonisation of current legislation is becoming crucial in light of the new state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It also makes perfect sense to involve operators in this sector, forcing them to adopt rules for the protection of citizens, enabling authorities to intervene in the event that the guarantees for protection that have been announced should prove to be insufficient. I also believe the intervention of the authorities is extremely important. The operators’ involvement of passengers by appealing for volunteers, involving them directly in the negotiation and acceptance of alternative arrangements, is a good approach that will make the management of reservations more flexible and will contribute to passenger protection, improving the efficiency of the operation. I would reiterate here the issue of the competent authority: the proposal for a regulation reveals the importance of Article 14, which deals with the obligation on the part of the authority in this field to inform passengers of their rights. Basically, this reincorporates an amendment adopted by Parliament in its response to the Commission’s 1998 proposal. Passengers must be informed clearly and transparently about how to contact the competent national body – of which they are often, even usually, unaware – responsible for dealing with complaints about the regulation. I would also emphasise the importance of Article 17, concerning implementation, which obliges Member States to designate the body responsible for the implementation of the regulation, to provide them with information and to force them to comply with measures ensuring that passengers’ rights are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a difficult report, given that, as we can see, it raises several points which run counter to the Commissioner’s proposal, whereas this committee has generally shared the Commissioner’s criteria. And in this case, we can see that there are certain discrepancies between the Commission proposal and what is now being suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner, because, regardless of the discrepancies that have been highlighted in the debate today, it was clear from the Commission debate that great courage was required to address a number of requirements from European citizens and users concerning the airlines. And although we do not currently agree, and we do not share the proposals made by the Commission, it has forced us to discuss the subject and try to align our positions. I would also like to say that no sector can or should try to survive on subsidies or by abusing its users. There is no future in that. We are facing – as the sector is aware – the need to restructure the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to tell the sector that it has one last chance, that we do not agree with the Commission proposals, that we should improve and strengthen previous proposals, make previous proposals stricter, but that the sector must move with the times; it must change, modernise and be able to respond. Otherwise, the citizens, who are our voters, are going to require us to be capable of defending their rights. At the same time, we must also try – and this is the message of the Parliamentary committee – to reach out to the sector during the difficult process of restructuring and modernisation. This is a difficult, complicated economic sector, and we are reaching out to it.</p>

I believe it was necessary and timely in light of two phenomena: on the one hand, the democratisation of air traffic that we must anticipate in all its forms and with all the consequences it entails and, on the other, the increase in denied boarding, which occurs sometimes and quite often – increasingly often, in fact – for reasons that are not openly declared and which are often commercial. It was, therefore, absolutely crucial to continue to make progress in affirming and protecting passengers’ rights, whilst avoiding falling into the trap of seeing the matter as all black or all white, and in particular the trap of excessively condemning the airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I wish to congratulate our rapporteur and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I would say that following this reading in the Committee on Transport, we are finally achieving quite a healthy balance. A balance first of all between passengers’ rights and a flexible service. Overbooking in particular is a bad thing when it is a systematic commercial practice, but it is also an argument for flexibility between those who cancel at the last moment, because customers are sometimes also responsible for overbooking, and those who could take their place. Balance has also been reached between airlines’ liability for compensation and the basic economic requirements of air transport, so that the payment of compensation does not have an undue knock-on effect on prices at a time when the economic situation is difficult or does not lead to an increase in prices for passengers. Lastly, balance has been reached between the cost of denied boarding and the precautionary principle in the field of safety. What had to be avoided at all costs was for sanctions or compensation to be so high that they cause airlines not to take major technical incidents quite so seriously, in other words, using safety to offset the costs of denied boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these various balances that have been achieved, the Committee on Transport has backed Mr Lisi and has today provided us with a useful text. My hope is that the Commission will take account of the comments and the recommendations of the European Parliament. I must also, however, express one regret: perhaps we have not been firm enough on waiting lists, which are often unclear and on which we should have forced airlines to allocate passengers seats in the order in which they booked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These issues affect us all too often, either because we ourselves are affected by delays or cancellations, overbooking and the like or because we experience at second hand what happens to other passengers and that is not always pleasant. Often it is even very unpleasant. In this situation, the European legislator has to act in the interests of consumers, but also in the interests of the air transport sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been said about the rules that we are examining here at first reading and on which we will vote tomorrow, about how best to tackle the problem of denied boarding, and about reasonable rules in the case of delays. Naturally, all these rules and regulations bring the industry little joy, particularly in the current difficult economic climate. But this is of course not only about the airlines; it is also and above all about the passengers. They in any case are repeatedly and increasingly frequently finding themselves to be the weaker party, and we need to protect and support them with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other player that we should consider here; I refer to the airport operators. They have been experiencing many problems recently because of increased concerns about terrorism and security. They have resolved a number of them, but in some cases their activities have become extremely expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem that remains unresolved: how passengers are treated. Nowadays flying is a massive business; there is no doubt about it. This should not mean, however, that passengers are treated like herds of animals. Perhaps we could also address these aspects of flying in the foreseeable future and regulate them accordingly. Passengers will thank us for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their speeches, which have shown differences on certain points, but which in any event support the idea of improving the quality of service in air transport. As several of you have pointed out, we are all significant users of this type of transport and therefore victims of low quality service.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank Mr Lisi for the effort he has made to find common ground between all the various positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain amendments are intended to exclude passengers of combined journeys from the scope of the Regulation. We believe that it is also necessary to protect this type of passenger. It is true that the specific Regulation provides for this protection, but not in an automatic way, but following a series of very complex procedures, including in some cases hearings before the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do is provide a simple, immediate and automatic solution for users of combined transport; we cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 13 and 15.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the sums of compensation, I said at the beginning that we are prepared to be flexible in relation to our initial position and, in this regard, the Commission cannot accept amendments such as No 23 and part of No 24 and No 31, which eliminates compensation in cases of slight delay. For the same reason, we cannot accept Amendment No 44 or Amendment No 45. However, we can accept Amendment No 40 – which Mrs Maes mentioned a moment ago – because it makes our position more flexible and means that we offer quantities which may be more balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it should be made very clear who is responsible for compensating passengers and offering them assistance in airports. We have chosen a simple solution: the responsibility falls to the company that has made the contract with the passenger, whether that be an airline or a tour operator.</p>
<p class="contents">The Transport Committee has recommended joint responsibility between the company and the carrier, but this could create uncertainty for passengers. Therefore, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 19 nor part of Nos 28, 29, 30 and part of No 31.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 and 21 could restrict the flexibility that airlines need to negotiate with possible volunteers and Amendment No 7 and part of Nos 14, 17, 20 and part of No 22 could hinder the practical application of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A significant proportion of Amendments Nos 25 and 33 would unnecessarily restrict the rights of passengers and we therefore reject them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 43, which would exclude third-country flights, we cannot accept it since it would disadvantage Community operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments Nos 5, 35 and 37 propose measures which are outside the scope of the Regulation we are discussing. Although we identify with the objectives they pursue and we are preparing proposals in relation to them, we regret that we cannot accept them and I would point out that, as Mr Vairinhos said a moment ago, information to users is absolutely essential if these rights are to be effective; hence the campaigns we have carried out to date with the support of the airports and the tour operators, but also – and I must make this very clear – with the support of the airlines, which cooperated significantly in relation to the objective of improving the quality of service.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank Mr Lisi and the honourable Members and hope that we can achieve a good result which will be of benefit to the consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
