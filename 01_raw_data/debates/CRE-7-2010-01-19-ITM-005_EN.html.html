<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, this is an important opportunity to raise the situation in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union wants normal relations with Iran, and our efforts on the nuclear issue are part of that. In this context, I will continue, in my capacity as High Representative, the role of my predecessor, Javier Solana, in the international talks with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran is an important country with a deep history and rich culture, and a remarkably talented population. The films and books coming out of Iran are impressive, the level of education of women is high, there is a capacity for public debate and the young population is vibrant and active. In many ways, Iranian society has the hallmarks and the capacity of a free society. The threat to the society has been reflected in the turmoil that followed what many in Iran saw as a fraudulent election last year. That, of course, is a matter for the Iranians. Our concern is that international norms and standards on civil and political rights must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I am deeply concerned over the reports of violent suppression of demonstrations and arbitrary detentions in Tehran and other Iranian cities during the recent Ashura commemorations at the end of December. The use of violence against demonstrators seeking to exercise their freedom of expression and rights of assembly is not acceptable. These are universal human rights that must be respected and those detained for peacefully exercising those rights should be released.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note with deep concern that many arrests seem to have targeted human rights defenders and journalists, and that many detained are denied access to legal representation and contact with their families. Iran must live up to its international obligations and treat detained persons in accordance with international human rights standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Another recent issue is the detention of another 12 members of the Baha’i religious community. These people must be assured a just, open and fair trial in accordance with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has spared no opportunity to ask the Iranian Government to respect those international obligations which they freely and voluntarily adhered to. We issue public statements and use other diplomatic means. We work through the United Nations: the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month. We will make full use of the upcoming review of Iran which will be held at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in early February.</p>
<p class="contents">On the nuclear issue, we regret that Tehran has not followed up on the last meeting between Javier Solana and Jalili, the chief negotiator, on 1 October in Geneva. We all assessed that the meeting was positive. But, in effect, Iran has now rejected a draft agreement proposed by the IAEA and has been refusing to pursue talks on the nuclear issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its negotiating partners are all committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, and to that end, we must continue to implement the dual-track approach. We need a serious engagement in meaningful talks from Tehran’s side.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective remains to build confidence that the nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The confidence deficit was further increased by the revelation that Iran has been building another enrichment facility without informing the IAEA in due time. In addition, Iran continues not to cooperate fully with the IAEA and not to respect its international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the EU and the international community stand united behind the negotiating effort, including by supporting that effort through appropriate measures. The widest possible unity is key if we are to achieve our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">If Iran sets out on a more constructive course on the nuclear issue and on regional stability in general, it could play an important role in the Middle East and Gulf region, which would reflect its rightful place and proud history.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the challenges posed by Iran weigh very heavy in my portfolio. This is a country which has enormous potential – and our readiness to engage with Iran constructively has been made over and over. I shall continue to make that case. I sincerely hope that, during the time of my mandate, I will return to this House with a more positive picture of relations with Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer particularly to civil rights and political freedoms, where we are seeing a truly incredible breakdown: the arbitrary exercise of violence, mass imprisonment of opposition members, murders, executions, non-governmental organisations prevented from doing their work, and the impossibility of exercising press freedom. A European Parliament delegation was even banned from entering.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in view of the present circumstances, I wonder whether it is worth visiting the country at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Your remarks on the nuclear front, Baroness Ashton, were very clear and also very forthright: Iran continues to produce enriched uranium despite warnings from the international community. It rejected the outstretched hand proffered to it by President Obama and rejected the latest plan suggested by the Six, which involved Russia and France.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: Do you believe that we have exhausted our patience with this country yet? Do you think we should now move on to adopt more hard-hitting measures or do you instead consider that a softly-softly approach is the best way of negotiating with the Iranian regime?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to tell you that I sincerely welcome your statement in favour of defending human rights in that country. The breaches are extremely severe and I believe, Mr President, that Parliament must condemn the human rights situation in the country without pulling its punches. I hope that it will be able to do this by approving the resolution on this topic. It must continue to hold firm, very firm, in its tireless defence of freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran’s membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not question Iran’s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area. It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community’s response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative’s speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A young woman in Iran, having done the same, would have likely been killed, imprisoned, tortured and raped since.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to new media, we have all seen the clips of the brutal way the Iranian regime cracks down on citizens who speak out peacefully for democracy and freedom. Recent arrests of human rights reporters by the intelligence office of the Revolutionary Guard show that the Iranian regime takes an increased interest in closing off the country. Their reports were heavily relied upon by international journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday was Martin Luther King Day. We commemorate a man who, too, marched the streets peacefully and said: ‘a time comes when silence is betrayal’. High Representative, this time has long arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barack Obama broke off his holidays over Christmas to speak out against yet more brutal attacks on citizens after Ashura. In the proposed two-track approach to Iran, balancing the nuclear question and human rights, the United States is increasingly emphasising human rights. Europe should take a stronger leadership position here, not only when it is politically safe to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The disaster in Haiti is a terrible tragedy, and I am glad you are taking action. However, the man-made disaster that is ongoing in Iran has not been met with leadership and coordination from the European side thus far. Last month, a delegation of this Parliament was supposed to visit Iran, but the regime did not want us to see with our own eyes its own weakness and division. It is high time that Europe takes one stance regarding Iran, and the world is waiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Is Iran’s current regime, which has lost its legitimacy and is divided internally, a credible actor in negotiations? What measures do you propose in the nuclear question that will target the government without harming the population? Are you willing to call an emergency talk in Europe on Iran?</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that human rights will remain Europe’s priority, how will you use the EU instrument for human rights? I believe we need to support citizens, civil society and journalists. The ‘Shelter City’ programme, proposed by the Czech Presidency, might be a useful tool to support Iranians under threat in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hearings with Commissioner Kroes, I asked her whether she is willing to work with you to make free speech on the Internet an integrated part of Europe’s foreign policy. I ask you the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Iran delegation has been engaged in dialogue with representatives of the government and of civil society and had made preparations for a delegation trip to Iran at the start of the month, although, unfortunately, this was cancelled at short notice.</p>
<p class="contents">The very dissatisfaction with the fraudulent elections and the constant increase in state repression and violence had caused the representatives of Iranian civil society to turn to the European Parliament. In their courageous move, they are seeking our support for the upholding of democratic freedoms and they are calling on us to take our own fundamental values seriously. The protests are many and they are still going on. The Iranian Government is being called on to give political answers to these unsolved questions, yet instead, we see an increase in the worst violations of human rights, such as torture and the assault of detainees, and we hear of the deaths of demonstrators, while unfair trials take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Iranians expect us to not only keep an eye on foreign policy and the nuclear programme, but also to see and to take action on the political situation within Iran. It is to be welcomed that countries such as Spain and Ireland are prepared to issue visas in an unbureaucratic way to the persecuted defenders of human rights, thus helping them out of acute danger. Other Member States should follow this example, and we also ask the Commission to provide rapid help to the politically persecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outside, what we can do is limited. The crucial changes must come from within the country itself. We must, however, keep the communication channels to the outside world open. In that context, we must be highly critical of foreign companies such as Siemens and Nokia, whose technology is helping to make censorship possible and even more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">As no agreement has been reached in the negotiations on the nuclear issue, there is more and more talk of imposing sanctions. It is not clear, however, what sanctions would have the desired influence on the political leadership. If the sanctions lead to a worsening of living standards for many people, an example being sanctions on petrol, they will not achieve their objective and will give the regime the opportunity to blame what it would call the hostile outside world for the deteriorating economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, very important to develop targeted and intelligent sanctions, including against individuals. Thus, for example, the Council can blacklist individuals responsible for the repressive measures of recent months. In the EU’s policy on Iran, what is crucial is that we create, and stick to, a dual-track policy. Despite the rebuffs, we need to seek political dialogue. Isolating Iran would help neither its people nor its neighbours in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Renewed sanctions must now be targeted and must be extremely damaging to the regime in Tehran. But, equally, we should recognise that Iran’s people and the Iranian regime are not the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Ahmadinejad stole the presidential election last year, we have seen many dissidents and brave young protestors take to the streets.

Indeed, such is the desperation in Iran that opposition leader Mir Hossain Musavi, hardly known to be a democrat in the past, has said he is prepared to sacrifice his own life for the future good of his own country. Meanwhile, outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely.</p>

While this debate was going on in Europe, the media in Iran was also intensively discussing the military option against Tehran’s controversial nuclear project. All Zionist lies and exaggerations, was the conservative newspaper Kayhan’s verdict on the purported nuclear threat. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme represents a serious security threat – for Israel, first and foremost, but for the wider region, too. I still hope, therefore, that the international community will no longer just recognise this, but will actually take action in this regard. In my view, all options must be on the table in this connection. An effective sanctions regime, which the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, was still calling for yesterday, will mean, at all events, that the Jewish state will absolutely not have to take unilateral action.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to a crucial question for the Council, for you, High Representative. Is there, in fact, a European basis for the rigorous tightening-up of the sanctions against the Iranian regime? Close commercial links between a number of prominent EU Member States – I need not name any names as you, too, must be aware of who they are – and the Islamic Republic could always pose major obstacles to seriously tackling the nuclear issue. Over recent weeks, the newspaper <span class="italic">The Wall Street Journal</span> has written a number of cutting opinion pieces about this that practically constituted charge sheets against Europe. In brief, Baroness Ashton, is there a basis for tightening up effective sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran? I await your answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The death sentence handed down to the recently sentenced protesters is a sign of how differently fundamental rights and their observance are handled in that country. It is also important to stress, however, that the EU’s external policy must not be lopsided, as we often gladly turn a blind eye to such things in the case of economically and geostrategically important partners – such as China or, perhaps, Saudi Arabia – despite the fact that serious deviations from our European ideas of democracy and the rule of law take place in these countries, too.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Iran delegation, it is a particular concern of mine that the delayed trip to Iran be reinstated as soon as possible in order to improve bilateral communications with the EU and, in so doing, possibly also make a contribution, through the dialogue, to defusing the dramatic situation in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights are being brutally violated before our eyes, and we are seeing terror of a kind we have not had to deal with for decades. An unprecedented wave of state repression is trying to silence those who are fighting for democratic reforms in Iran. In the fight against its citizens, the government is also using the specially trained, armed young people of the Basij militia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must condemn the government’s excessive use of force and increasing breaches of human rights. It is also unacceptable to use the death penalty against the opposition, including under the pretext of the crime of ‘moharebeh’, offending God. Therefore, the European Union needs a new approach to the situation in Iran. The European Union’s High Representative, Catherine Ashton, should send a strong and clear message to the citizens of Iran, confirming our desire to defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of a nuclear weapon is extremely important. However, we should not stop defending fundamental values simply to gain a tactical advantage in negotiations. In talks with Iran, we must not marginalise the rule of law, freedom of speech or the right to information. These values must not be treated as of less significance.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Poland where, over 20 years ago, in 1989, tyranny gave place to democracy.

<p class="contents">However, the role of the European Union in its relations with Iran must not be wasted on the nuclear question. Since the rigged elections in June, we have witnessed a popular movement against the repressive, obscurantist and anti-democratic nature of the Iranian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must be consistent in promoting the universal value of human rights, for which many people are risking their lives on the streets of Tehran. Without questioning the people’s sovereign right to decide their own destiny, it is imperative that the European Union takes steps to encourage those who are fighting for liberty and democracy in Iran. There is nothing more effective than free and alternative channels of information for combating censorship, which is the preserve of all oppressive regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, we expect the Farsi television channel, awarded to Euronews by the European Commission, to be up and running very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect that Baroness Ashton, as the new High Representative, will push ahead with creative initiatives that will contribute to greater political transparency in Iran, and taking on board the recommendations made by all those who have been struggling for a free Iran, including exiled Iranians.</p>

<p class="contents">At the start of the debate, Mrs Ashton mentioned the NGO reports, disastrous reports in this regard, without even talking about the parody of justice meted out to the French woman, Clotilde Reiss, and to the Baha’i minority – seven of whom have been on trial in Tehran since last Monday. They risk life imprisonment or worse, simply because their religion is different from that of the ruling power.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is harsh, the presidential elections have changed nothing, or rather they have: they have radicalised the Iranian regime even more, if that were possible; there is also radicalisation with regard to the outside world, with the volte-face of the Iranian authorities on the draft nuclear agreement negotiated in October 2009 in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">When are we going to consider mentioning – I say mentioning here – intelligent and targeted sanctions, such as those referred to by Mrs Lochbihler; sanctions, therefore, against this regime, which is openly anti-Western and anti-Semitic?

It is clear that the regime intends to increase repression and establish a climate of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this domestic situation, Iran demonstrates a lack of international cooperation, refusing the International Atomic Energy Agency access to Iranian sites for uranium enrichment. This clearly shows the real intentions of the Iranian atomic programme; if they were solely peaceful, there would be no need to hide them.</p>

The situation in Iran is certainly proof of the significance of democracy, namely the ability of every single citizen to give expression to his or her political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Those with political responsibility in Iran are currently responding to this legitimate will of society with repression by the State extending as far as the death penalty. These assaults on the citizens must be stopped immediately, as State repression will certainly not bring an end to this will of society. On the contrary, Iran’s long history shows us this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the planned trip of the European Parliament’s delegation to Tehran that was cancelled by the Iranian Government at short notice, I would just like to say that, at this point in time, this trip was really important in order, above all, to lead to talks and dialogues with everyone, including, and in particular, with the local citizens and civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now we find that the repression is still continuing against the Baha’i religious minority, against homosexuals – and I particularly call for the release of imprisoned homosexuals, who are sentenced to death in some cases – against the opposition – with more than 2 500 of the opposition imprisoned – against press freedom – only this Monday we saw the newspaper<span class="italic"> Farhang-e-Ashti</span> closed down for publishing a statement by Mr Mousavi, the opposition leader – and against the Kurdish minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran remains a great challenge on the European agenda, and not merely because of the nuclear threat: the international community is already taking action against this. The challenge is that Iran possesses a great ability to influence practically all the areas where efforts are being made to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution in the Near East, and also in Iraq and in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its repressive actions, Iran is destroying any opportunity of normalising its foreign relations, so that it can be accepted by the community of nations and play a constructive role in international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the situation we socialists desire, but it can only be achieved if Iran meets its international commitments, beginning with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the terms of this covenant, Iran must recognise political parties, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, the right to association, freedom of expression, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The support and solidarity of the European Union, which I now call for on behalf of those who demand more rights and for those repressed by the regime, must not be mistaken for any type of Western interference. Instead, it represents a wish for Iran to meet the minimum requirements necessary to enable it to negotiate with the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights. Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them. When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran.

<p class="contents">So, for this Parliament and for Europe, the issue is no longer simply that of relations with a country which is thinking about a nuclear policy outside the accepted rules and the specific control elements which, as a rule, are laid down by the international community for these matters. There is something new, or something old is becoming more acute, relating to an even more worrying issue: human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Iran could potentially have a much more important role in the region in which it is located. However, this fresh wave of infringements of rights must, I believe, constitute a priority for us and for the High Representative. The clamp-down by the government has not subdued the voices of democratic dissent. Now it is appropriate for the international community to play an active role and to provide assistance to those who oppose the regime and believe that their fundamental rights must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore have a permanent presence there. The European Parliament’s delegation can, by identifying very precise objectives, go to Iran to show its solidarity with the Iranian democrats, and certainly not to back, even involuntarily, the clamp-down by the Iranian Government.

In clashes with security forces, eight people died, hundreds were injured and hundreds were detained. Students supporting the opposition were attacked on the university campus, which brought a reaction from 88 of the university’s professors in the form of an appeal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to stop using force against the demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Iran is causing rising alarm, and this is also true at international level. Imposition of sanctions against the government in Tehran is being considered by the Germans, whose Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, has said that Iran has not replied to the West’s proposal of cooperation on ending its nuclear programme. Israel’s Prime Minister has also appealed for the introduction of severe international sanctions against Iran. In his opinion, a regime which tyrannises its own people may soon become a threat to the entire world.</p>
<p class="contents">While respecting the sovereignty of Iran, we should strongly stress the responsibility resting on the country’s authorities to respect human, political and citizens’ rights, and we should also stress the fact that in exercising its right to develop its own nuclear programme, Iran must not, at the same time, pose a threat to international security. The patience which the international community has shown in conducting dialogue with Tehran is now coming to an end. The world must not be held hostage by the aggressive and provocative policy of the current political leadership in Iran. The Spanish Presidency and the head of diplomacy, Mrs Ashton, should initiate talks on this matter with Russia, to include Moscow in a common policy of pressure on Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thirdly, in 2006, the socialist liberal government of Hungary of the time ordered shots to be fired into crowds of peaceful demonstrators. 14 people suffered eye injuries, among others. Many of them were blinded. Despite our repeated requests, the EU refused then, and refuses still, to deal with this event. What is the difference? Similarly, they do not deal with the hundreds of political prisoners that have spent time in jail in Hungary. Even today, there are dozens of political prisoners in jail in Hungary.

Of course, it is beyond dispute that we must defend human rights and resolutely express our concern about the violations of the rights of the opposition which have been going on for several months. However, I want to say that the European Union should, above all, actively implement an antinuclear programme, because Iran with a nuclear weapon would be a huge threat to a whole part of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we know that the instigation of revolution in Yemen and support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip and for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan are probably also the inspiration behind part of Iranian policy. In relation to this, what is needed here more than anything is a certain balance, and I think Saudi Arabia should also have an important role to play. I think we should see very active dialogue and engagement in this matter on the part of Mrs Ashton. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And indeed, in our dialogue with Iran, we ask nothing more than that they live up to the international agreements which they have willingly and voluntarily signed, and that is a fundamental part of the way in which we have to approach these questions, and Members have, both by naming individuals and by describing events in Iran, highlighted the issues which are of the greatest concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Members, too, have made the point that in the end, as you said, Mr Gualtieri, the dialogue must be inevitable. It is very important that we continue to offer the approach that says ‘meaningful dialogue’. But I do so recognising that my predecessor, Javier Solana, spent six years in dialogue, six years offering to continue that debate; so, dialogue, but not as an excuse for inaction on behalf of Iran, but rather as a means of making sure that we develop the strength of that relationship and that we achieve what we believe to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">And as part of that, the talks on World Trade Organisation membership, which have been going nowhere for a long time, could be a way in which we could find the kind of debate and discussion and support to enable the regime to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have talked about the importance of sanctions, but I think particularly – intelligent, smart sanctions: the critical importance to all of us of ensuring, as we begin to think about what next, and, if we do, and as we do, consider the possibility of sanctions, that we do so recognising that they must be aimed and targeted specifically to achieve what we wish and that no one in this House wishes to see ordinary people in Iran suffer as a consequence of that.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes that debate very important, but also requires us to invest energy and time within it. The E3+3 senior officials met in New York on Saturday and we were able to have the dialogue, including, of course, with Russia, on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt, as I have said, that, though we wish to take forward the meaningful relationship with Iran through dialogue, ultimately, if Iran rejects this, then, under the dual-track policy that we have, the question of sanctions arises and, indeed, as a consequence of that meeting, consideration of the appropriate further measures has already begun.</p>
<p class="contents">This, too, will be an item for discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, and that is partly why I was so keen to hear honourable Members’ views as I prepare for those discussions too.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the delegation going to the country, Mrs Lochbihler, you are indeed the chair of the delegation. It is very important that it has not yet officially been cancelled. I think it would be important to consider whether we should pursue that. I hope that meeting can take place soon, again in the spirit of trying to keep the dialogue open.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, as a result specifically of the action of this Parliament, have Euronews beginning its broadcasts in Farsi in the middle of 2010. That is important, too, in terms of communication and looking at how we use communication and technology effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to think about blocking access if, at the same time, we block the access to the information that people wish to get, and that, I think, is something we have to be mindful of.</p>
<p class="contents">And in terms of looking at what we do for the future, honourable Members have made it clear what they wish us to consider. As I have said, the E3+3 is already considering these options. We have the Foreign Affairs Council. I have indicated we want to look at smart, intelligent sanctions as we consider this dual track. I have made it clear, and I continue to make it clear, that I am open and ready to have the dialogue – and I described in my opening remarks the potential of this great country – but we do so in the certain knowledge that we cannot continue to use dialogue as a way of preventing action.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to end by saying I was very struck by the phrase that President Obama used in his Nobel Prize reception speech when he said that, when we look at the value of continuing with engagement, ‘engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. But [...] no repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door’.</p>
<p class="contents">The door is open for that meaningful dialogue in order to move forward but, in saying that, I am absolutely committed to recognising the twin track that my predecessors laid out and to pursuing that as necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
