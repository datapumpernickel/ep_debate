These 26 candles are a symbol that these detainees should not be forgotten and, indeed, I hope that these 26 and all 600 detainees will have access to justice. I would ask the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, to raise this at every opportunity with the US Administration and to place it on the agenda for the next EU-US summit.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to inform the House that during his last visit some months ago, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, made a number of commitments to the House on behalf of the Italian Presidency. Each of the commitments made to Parliament regarding our participation in the Intergovernmental Conference has been 100% delivered.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>

<p class="contents">Second, I should point out that insofar as there may be a number of technical working groups on some aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament will be fully associated with the work of any such group.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, for the first time ever, the President of the European Parliament has been invited by the presidency of the Council to attend and contribute to every summit meeting to be held on the Intergovernmental Conference, first in Rome on 4 October 2003, and again last week in Brussels. This is an exceptional and unprecedented level of engagement. It meets a request this House made before the Italian Presidency started: the Convention set a new method, and a new partnership is required to build a Europe that has a constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to place on the record on my behalf and on behalf of this House our gratitude to the presidency for delivering as promised.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berlusconi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, thank you for noting that the Presidency has delivered on the commitments which I, personally, made before the House relating to the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to report on the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference and the recent European Council. At the opening of the Conference on 4 October 2003, the Heads of State or Government, together with the President of Parliament and the President of the European Commission, adopted the Declaration of Rome, which reaffirmed the essential role of European integration in securing peace, democracy, prosperity and solidarity in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that we have pursued our efforts in close cooperation with the European Parliament, as you mentioned, Mr President. The participation of President Cox in the meetings in Rome and Brussels and the participation of Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez de Vigo underscore the historic importance of the constitutional step we are in the process of taking.</p>
<p class="contents">The meetings of the Conference that have been held to date have confirmed that there is broad consensus on most of the provisions drafted by the Convention. Differences remain regarding the specific reservations of some Member States. We feel that it is essential to assess the draft document produced by the Convention as a whole, with the aim of strengthening each institution while preserving the balance that has been achieved between them. The coming weeks will tell us whether it will be possible to achieve an agreement during the Italian Presidency. Moreover, the Italian Presidency reiterates its refusal to support a watered-down compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that we intend to submit in the second half of November, with a view to the final stages of negotiations, will offer worthy, noble solutions for a European Union capable of playing a leading role in bringing security, freedom and peace to the world. In this connection, let me recall the progress that has been made in the field of common foreign and security policy, one of the pillars of the future Constitutional Treaty. The debate between the Heads of State or Government of 16 October confirmed that there is consensus on the issue, which, I would say, is increasing. In particular, the common foreign and security policy will be all the more effective and credible if it is part of a framework that is fully compatible with and complementary to the transatlantic relationship. This aspect must be unambiguously reaffirmed in the future Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to last week's European Council, the proceedings were devoted to the issues of economic growth, boosting competitiveness and immigration policy. The discussion revealed the shared desire for full coherence with the Lisbon Strategy. In particular, I would like to stress the agreement in principle on the European Initiative for Growth: an initiative that the Italian Presidency launched at the start of the six-month term and which the Commission has fully endorsed and made its own. The Initiative seeks to create transport infrastructure and energy and telecommunications networks, with a parallel effort to increase investment in innovation and research. The implementation of these projects, as regards both infrastructure and innovation and research, will have to be financed by an appropriate mix of public and private funds, which will have a key role to play here. The Commission has committed itself to the swift definition and launch of a package of projects for rapid implementation, with the possibility of a higher rate of cofinancing from the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the European Council also underscore the importance of an undertaking by the Union and the individual Member States to enhance the competitiveness of the European production sector across the board. This emphasis is manifested in the call for rapid final approval of the Community patent regulation, the appeal to the Member States to step up the pace of transposal of Community internal market legislation into national law, and, above all, the call for rapid progress on the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan and for rapid conclusion of the work on the take-over bids directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we reiterated the objective of investing 3% of GDP in research and innovation. The Council also reaffirmed the importance of the quality of legislation and, above all, the importance of simplification, deregulation and the efficiency and transparency of public administrations. Lastly, we confirmed the importance of the social dimension of European economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards employment, we await the report of the task force headed by Wim Kok, which will be discussed at an extraordinary Social Summit that the Presidency plans to convene on the eve of the December European Council. We addressed a number of aspects of social protection with a view to making open coordination of Member States’ policies in this field more effective. The aim is to promote and facilitate the modernisation of social protection systems in order to cope with the gradual ageing of the European population and to ensure the financial sustainability of pension<span class="bold"> </span>systems. We felt obliged to take note of this problem collectively without, however, interfering in the decision-making independence of the individual Member States. Our purpose is to compare respective practices and to set common objectives to ensure the success of the intergenerational pact that underpins social cohesion within our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also addressed certain aspects of the programme<span class="bold"> </span>of work<span class="bold"> </span>established at Tampere, Laeken, Seville and, lastly, Thessaloniki, regarding asylum and immigration. We reaffirmed our commitment to the balanced approach we have adopted thus far to the need to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and strengthen external border control, and also to develop common policies for the reception and integration of legal immigrants to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At Thessaloniki, we set out the programme of work. At Brussels, we gave further impulse to certain specific issues. In the area of external border control, we noted the importance of the various joint initiatives that have been developed in recent months, which deserve better coordination. For this reason, we welcomed the Commission's proposal to create a Border Management Agency<span class="bold"> </span>to enhance the various forms of operational cooperation between the Member States for the management of external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards controlling migratory flows, we reaffirmed the importance of an effective common policy for readmission and return. We thus urged the Commission to pursue the conclusion of readmission agreements with third countries, and we welcomed the Commission's proposal to provide adequate financial support for border management and return activities. I believe President Prodi is going to update the House on the decisions taken in this regard. Lastly, we felt it necessary to confirm, once again, the importance of forging constructive partnerships with third countries, both countries of origin and transit countries, to ensure the effective management of migratory flows.</p>
<p class="contents">While reaffirming full respect for national prerogatives in the sensitive area of deciding the number of legal immigrants to be admitted to their territories, we welcomed the Commission's initiation of a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration. I would like to pause here to recall the recent tragedy and the horror, the sorrow we felt, and also the other tragic incidents which continue to take place in the Mediterranean, just off the Italian coast, which affect us even more deeply. The loss of so many lives, of people driven by the force of desperation to seek a better future, must genuinely spur us to strengthen our mutual cooperation and prevent such disasters from ever happening again. I would also like to stress here that our Christian principles tell us that we must genuinely seek to give these immigrants a reception which is worthy of our level of civilisation, these people who leave their countries where poverty reigns and come to Europe trusting solely in their will to work and in the strength of their arms. I believe that we must all reflect carefully on the need for civilised Europe, Christian Europe, the Europe of prosperity, to open its doors and welcome those who come here hoping sincerely to be able to build a better future for themselves and their children.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council also considered a number of international developments that, given their urgency and importance, required the European Union to adopt a position. With regard to the situation in the Middle East, the Council confirmed its commitment to the position the Union has always consistently held: on the one hand, its unwavering, unconditional condemnation of terrorism and its firm demand that the Palestinian Authority display genuine, practical determination to combat extremist violence; and, on the other, its demand that the Israeli Government change its settlement policy and, in exercising its legitimate right to defend its citizens, avoid actions which might cause civilian casualties. Thus, Europe reiterates its determination to contribute to the implementation of all aspects of the roadmap, stressing the importance of an effective international monitoring mechanism. We also confirmed the urgent need for an economic plan to revive the region's economy – which we named after the plan which brought about Europe’s recovery after the Second World War, the Marshall Plan – with the support of the G8 countries and the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iraq, the Council welcomed the unanimous approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1511. This resolution improves the outlook for the Donors Conference, which is, as you know, to be held in Madrid on 24 October 2003. The European Union will make an initial pledge of EUR 200 million, already appropriated in the Community budget for 2003-2004. In this regard, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission were asked to develop a medium-term strategy for the European Union’s relations with Iraq and to present a progress report by March 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Iran, we confirmed our attention to the deadline of the end of October established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the country to implement specific guarantees with regard to its nuclear programme. The Iranian Government was again called on to sign, ratify and implement promptly and unconditionally the Additional Protocol on Safeguards and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. At the same time, the European Union reiterated its willingness to develop wider cooperation with Iran. The Italian Presidency maintained constant contact with France, Germany and the United Kingdom with regard to the mission of their Foreign Ministers to Teheran yesterday, 21 October. The Presidency has closely followed the developments of the initiative since its conception in July 2003, considering it part of the broad action of the European Union as regards Iran. We therefore welcome the positive outcome of that mission. This development – if confirmed – will help create the conditions agreed on by the Brussels European Council which are necessary to foster cooperation with an important partner for the stability of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also addressed other developments in world affairs. On Kosovo, firstly, the Council urged all of the parties involved in the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to engage constructively in this process. As regards the Republic of Moldova, we called for the resolution of the Transdniestrian issue and reiterated our support for the OSCE's mediation efforts. The European Union remains attentive to developments in areas that are more distant geographically but are nevertheless linked to us by historical and cultural bonds. We refer to the tragic developments in the situation in Bolivia and the turbulent preparations for elections in Guatemala, and express our concern at the violence and intimidation that is dominating the pre-electoral period there.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to note the warm congratulations extended by the European Council to His Holiness John Paul II on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of a pontificate devoted to building peace and solidarity among peoples. The President-in-Office of the European Council has been charged by the Council to express, on its behalf, its support for and thanks to the Pope, not least in view of the important role played by his efforts to uphold civil rights, which the Council believes directly contributed to the collapse of the regime in the Soviet Union and certainly contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the summary report of our work. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when I last spoke to you, I pointed out that, although the underlying fundamentals are in place, quick, decisive action is needed to pull the Union’s economy out of the current period of stagnation. That is why the Commission presented the European Initiative for Growth I outlined to you at the beginning of the month. Today, I am pleased to say that the European Council has endorsed our ideas for reviving the economy and stimulating growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Growth Initiative is simple and practical. It does not seek to alter the priorities of the Lisbon strategy, but to bolster and speed up its implementation. Its main aims will be, firstly, to overcome the barriers to coordination, especially those deriving from red tape, and, secondly, to mobilise the public and private-sector funds needed to finance certain infrastructure projects already on the drawing board and get them started. That is why we are preparing a quick-start list of infrastructure and research projects that are on a genuinely European scale. The projects selected for the quick-start list will be taken from the longer list of 29 projects put forward earlier this year. They will include major trans-European transport links and other projects with a high-technology content. The list is based on two main ideas: a desire to produce practical results quickly and the great need to ensure compatibility with the sustainable-development goals we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This desire to produce tangible results takes three main forms. Firstly, it takes advantage of the potential offered by a higher rate of Union cofinancing. Indeed, the Commission has proposed raising the Community’s contribution to 30% of the cost of the cross-border component of each project. This brings greater leverage in mobilising private-sector and other public-sector funding. Secondly, it concentrates resources on a small number of mature projects. The impact of investments will be all the greater if financial efforts are focused on those projects that are ready for take-off instead of being dispersed. Thirdly, it selects projects with the highest potential to<span class="bold"> </span>produce results quickly. This means practically resolving the most complex difficulties, particularly with a view to enlargement, creating jobs, stimulating growth and harnessing research and technological innovation potential, laying the foundations for improvements to competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the quick-start list gives great consideration to compatibility, and the projects selected are sustainable in environmental as well as in economic and financial terms. In particular, however, the funding must comply with the Stability and Growth Pact and it must be in line with the commitment to improve the quality of expenditure, as set out in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. May I express my appreciation, at this point, for the great spirit of cooperation displayed by the European Investment Bank, which has drawn up a meticulous plan for financing this Initiative and with which we are working in complete harmony. Of course, these are not the only projects that can be implemented under the Growth Initiative. Personally, I hope others will be added to the list.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several other important aspects to this Initiative. Firstly, it defines the priorities better and more clearly and concentrates resources on the best projects; it coordinates management of operative phases of major projects better, where appropriate appointing a coordinator to help resolve difficulties holding up the completion of work; it takes the regulatory environment into account and it tackles other bureaucratic and administrative factors that have slowed up completion thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we go from here? The European Council has endorsed the ideas in the Initiative. Indeed, it has given the Commission the green light to prepare a detailed proposal, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, to put to the Heads of State or Government for approval in December. The European Council's endorsement is very good news: programmes, action plans and consensus are all very well but they will not just produce investment at the drop of a hat. To change things on the ground, we will need political will and a major undertaking. The next few months will therefore be an important test for the European Union in this area. In other words, if we are serious about meeting the Lisbon targets, we must hope that, in December, the European Council turns words into action and implements our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the second topic I wish to report on is the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, the plan is for the draft Constitution to be approved at the Brussels European Council in December. This will allow a new Treaty of Rome to be signed some time afterwards, at any rate before the European Parliament elections.</p>
<p class="contents">If the new Constitution is to be approved in December, it is vital for the Presidency to come forward by mid-November with clear proposals that can meet with consensus. I would stress, here, that the Convention produced a balanced package of proposals containing some important innovations. Overall, we continue to regard that package as a good basis for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Intergovernmental Conference has to go into the points that were not addressed by the Convention or not dealt with in sufficient depth. However, there are only a very few points where the draft Constitution needs changing and the ministers' meetings of 4 and 13 October showed that many of these points concern issues that the Constitution need not settle. It is more appropriate for them to be dealt with in secondary legislation or in the internal rules of the various institutions. This would appear to be very important if we are to achieve effective conclusions quickly. Today, I just want to focus on one point that, without a doubt, does need addressing at the Conference because it is likely to become a sticking point. As you know, throughout the last Intergovernmental Conference, I fought for double simple majority voting in Council decision-making. Indeed, our fellow citizens would intuitively understand such a system because it would be simple and transparent. It would also make for more effective, streamlined decision-making. I have never concealed the fact that, on this point, I was disappointed with the outcome at Nice and I have done my best to promote a simple system: a simple majority of at least 50% of the Member States and of 50% plus one of the population. The draft Constitution put forward by the Convention provided for a slightly more complicated system: 50% of the Member States and 60% of the population. That is not quite what we had hoped for but, overall, I feel it is still a satisfactory solution, for it is simple and transparent and means decisions can be taken.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In practical terms, under this system, decisions have practically the same chances of being adopted successfully as under the extremely complex weighting system concocted at Nice. There are some, however, who would now like to raise the figure for a qualified majority to 66% of the population. We must strongly oppose this idea, which seeks to overturn the balance crafted by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the possible consequences, it would make it so much easier for a small minority to block an initiative and hamstring the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the way it is made up, as we have already said, the Commission must reflect all national perspectives. Moreover, even the Convention came out in favour of a Commission comprising one Commissioner from each Member State. Little consideration has been given to this, but the Convention’s proposal is<span class="bold"> </span>one Commissioner per Member State. However, the structure proposed was complicated and, in my opinion, unworkable. Our proposal must not, therefore, be seen as reopening the constitutional package – there is already one Commissioner per Member State – but, in actual fact, as a contribution to a final compromise. The proof is that a majority of countries are clearly in favour of a Commission with Commissioners coming from each Member State of the Union and all enjoying the same voting rights. That is the difference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This could bring us closer to a balanced, politically acceptable solution. The Commission has already put forward suggestions for organising an enlarged Commission that would ensure it is effective in decision-making terms as well as having full legitimacy. Anyone who imagines the Commission is seeking to introduce a <span class="italic">directoire</span> here or that we could stray so far from the vision of the founding fathers is, therefore, way off track. The Commission can play its political role only if it can assert a legitimacy and credibility of its own, and these derive from its close link with national cultures and perspectives across the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is a third point which it is absolutely vital to address: ensuring that the Constitution can be amended in the future. We are aware that, if changes have to be agreed and ratified unanimously by 25 or more different parties, this will mean, in practice, that the Constitution cannot be amended.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Any reform will be completely impossible. Remember – and, here, since everyone else is doing so, I really do want to recall the great battle that took place over the wording of the US Constitution – that, if it cannot be amended, our Constitution will not be workable and will fall apart at the very first hitch. An inflexible Constitution is worse than nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen from these brief words, the European Union needs a dynamic economy and a sound Constitution. We must muster the strength of the large Member States and rally the support of the smaller for the good of all. We must release all our existing energies and harness our resources to the full. When we speak of harnessing our resources to the full, I am also thinking of the resources we draw from legal immigration – which the President-in-Office of the Council rightly mentioned – the immigrants that form the bulk of the workforce for those jobs that our young people no longer want to do – there is no point in pretending this is not the case – and the highly qualified technicians we vitally need for our industry and our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole phenomenon of migration is very difficult to manage, both in terms of the need to integrate legal immigrants, who must share in the rights that our society guarantees to all its citizens, and in terms of combating illegal immigration and the latter-day trade in human beings that violates all our values so intolerably. This is not a burden that we can leave the individual Member States to bear, not least because it would be heavier for some Member States than others. Today, no one can cope with it satisfactorily, given the lack of a single EU policy approach to the phenomenon. The Commission has done its part and perhaps even more than its duty, for many of our proposals have not been accepted. There was the Tampere programme and the Thessaloniki programme too. Now we have undertaken to adopt a proposal very quickly on an agency for the common management of borders. That is a lot, and I am happy to acknowledge it, but it is not enough. It is clear from what Mr Berlusconi said that the problem continues to have very tragic consequences and that it may even be growing. A single policy approach is needed and funding will have to be found to implement it. Common channels must be defined for legal immigration and a global negotiation organised on that basis with the countries of emigration, the countries of provenance of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Moreover – to show you the full extent of the problems – these countries need to have such legal lists so they can step up measures to discourage these desperate attempts by illegal immigrants. We must guarantee to these countries that at least a minimal amount of their emigration can be regularised; in other words, there must be cooperation between us. It was not possible to achieve this at the last Council, but the Commission will strike out once again along this road because we see it as the only way of actively managing immigration, both legal and illegal. I cannot close my eyes to these recurring tragedies that have been mentioned. We cannot close our eyes to them, and the Commission certainly will not.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference was at the heart of the Brussels Summit, and our group welcomes the Italian Presidency’s determination and goodwill in intending to come up with a result in time for the Summit on 12/13 December. We wish to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your endeavours to bring this about, for, if the Intergovernmental Conference drags itself out into 2004, there is an even greater risk of further chapters being opened, with the result that we will not come to a conclusion. We therefore urge you to do everything to enable a result to be achieved under your presidency. We are alongside you in doing so. As regards the institutional issues, we urge that any solution to the problem of the Commission’s composition should be satisfactory to both the large and small countries. We warn against the mere acknowledgement that the larger countries have claims, for the smaller ones, too, are entitled to appropriate representation, and this is an issue I wish you much success in resolving. If you manage to do so, then it will also be possible to resolve the issue of the European Council’s Presidency and of its composition.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the voting in the Council of Ministers, the overwhelming majority in our group is not of one mind; there are one or two exceptions, but the overwhelming majority favours the dual-majority principle as proposed by the Convention. We take the view that the Convent has put before us a proposal that is in line with the Community method, and one that we should allow to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Legislative Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we insist that transparency and continuity be introduced into the legislative work of the European Council of Ministers. This is an area in which we must not revert to old-style secret diplomacy, with it not being known what goes on behind the doors of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One problem that we must resolve is the Maastricht issue, that of price stability. Although price stability is a constituent element in the Constitution, nowhere do we see the 3% deficit limit being kept to, and general requirement to maintain price stability is of little use if it lacks an explicit basis. We therefore ask that it be ensured that clear and quantifiable bases, with reference to protocols, are in place in order that price stability should not exist merely in theory, but may, in practical terms too, remain a central element in our common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may comment on the external borders, it is with great joy that I have heard that Mr Berlusconi, the President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, have come to an agreement on immigration matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union do, of course, need our external borders to be protected, but our concern is that protection of the external borders resolves only part of the problem, which is a profoundly human one. The sight of wretched, hungry, thirsty people, including children – such as we have seen on the shores of the island of Lampedusa – shows that this is not just about the protection of our external borders, but about these pitiable people being given a chance in their own countries and not needing to get in their boats. That is why it is important that border controls should be carried out within the countries from which these people emigrate and that developments in them should be brought to completion so as to make it possible for young people to look forward to a proper, good, and decent future in their own homeland. To that end, we, the European Union, have our own contribution to make in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">The word ‘Guantanamo’ featured in my notes – with which I can now dispense – even before we heard of Mr Watson’s symbolic and expressive action in the Chamber. We take the view that major problems are adequately addressed by the use of persuasion. Our concern is not only with the twenty-six Europeans, but also with all those who are detained in Guantanamo. Whilst we are all in favour of combating terrorism, our Christian conception of man teaches us that every human being, even the worst of criminals, has the right to be tried in accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We therefore appeal to our American friends to abide by the principles of human rights. Consider, if you will, that these 600 detainees include five or six who have done nothing. What harm is being done to these people, and how unjustly they are being treated! That is the actual crux of our European attitude to the death penalty. Even if only one person is wrongly executed, that is sufficient reason to deny the death penalty any justification whatever.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What I say to the Americans I say as one who thinks of himself as one of their friends, urging them to understand our position, which is founded on the rule of law and on human dignity, that every human being is of equal worth, whatever the colour of their skin, their gender, or their nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn, for my final comments, to the subject of European defence. I speak as one who had the pleasure of serving for ten years as chairman of Parliament’s security and disarmament subcommittee, when we always supported Europe’s strong defence capacity as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance. We want the North Atlantic Alliance to be founded on the twin pillars of Europe and the USA, and we would ask our American friends to understand why we are reinforcing Europe’s defences. Far from this being in opposition to the US, we seek to complement each other, and want to be strong together. At the heart of this is our joining in defending our common values. It is on that foundation that any common European defence policy must rest.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the President—in-Office of the Council on the Brussels Summit offers us – to put it in artistic terms – a sketch, an outline in chiaroscuro, because a very important challenge for the whole of Europe is being faced, which is to draw up the Constitution and also to organise our territory. It makes good sense, therefore, at the same time as the Constitution, to talk about the networks of arteries and nerves – the infrastructure networks – which give structure to something which is more than just a market: a project aimed at sharing our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I must express my group’s concern, because it gives the impression that it is producing a litany, a repetition of positions, and is not getting down to solving problems. I must say that we are very concerned about the fact that the first decision to be made – with the opposition of the representatives of Parliament – has been to remove the Legislative Council. This is very important, because we are in a Parliament and, having achieved shared legislative power for the first time, the Conference’s first decision has been to eliminate the possibility of legislating jointly with us. I would therefore ask that this mistaken decision be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the voting system, we have three problems which must be resolved jointly: the composition of the Commission, the Presidency of the Council and the voting system. In this regard, I must say that, for our part, on the basis that our thinking involves how to make decisions together – and not how to block them – we support the system of double majority, as proposed by the Convention. I would draw attention to an aspect which is important to Parliament: do not use Parliamentary seats as jokers for concluding your negotiations. This is a much more serious issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the draft Constitution, I would also like to point out that the economic issue demonstrates the insufficiency of an important matter: the regulation of economic governance. This is a very important problem in terms of price stability and also in terms of how we take coherent decisions, not only on monetary policy but also on economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of revising the Constitution is essential since a Constitution cannot be closed completely. That would make it completely useless.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Guantánamo – on which we held a hearing with other political groups in Parliament in order to debate the issue – I must say that at the moment we have European citizenship in the Constitution. However, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is the governments of the Member States which have to defend the European citizens. I would ask you to urge the governments to take on their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economy, what you have done has been basically to rescue the Delors Plan – ten years later – to overcome the Ecofin Council's veto – which has been blocking this plan – and now you are proposing a series of actions which would really make sense, including the launch of a European loan, because here there is talk of how well the European Investment Bank can do it, but we will have to see whether private capital – of which there is plenty – is offered. This is an important issue which has not been clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, that with the cardinal’s language you have used, what you are proposing are recommendations to the national governments. It is not the European Parliament which is holding up the European patent. We are not holding up the transposition of regulations: it is the ministers and their governments who have to obey you. It is not for you to give advice, but to order your own governments to implement the policies you decide on. This is truly notable because it is a kind of litany which is repeated systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to employment, we eagerly await the Koch report and it makes sense to talk about the issue which was launched under the Swedish Presidency of the European demographic autumn in relation to pensions and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">On immigration and the decisions of the European Council in Thessaloniki, I would like to say to you, Mr President, given that Europe is secular and that European values are not the monopoly of any single religion – for the first time in history, fortunately – that we share in the regrets and condolences over what is happening. I must also say that in your government there are people who are doing positive work – and we are quite happy to recognise it: Mr Pisanu is demonstrating serious political responsibility in the face of absolutely intolerable and xenophobic attitudes on the part of other members of your government. Mr Pisanu is taking the same approach as another Italian Interior Minister – Mr Napolitano – who was the person who initiated the policy of agreements with countries from which immigrants originate, a policy which should be developed, and I do not believe it is sufficient to talk about the Borders Agency, we should talk about co-development and quotas, and you must reach an agreement on this. This is the approach which really makes sense for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, as well as our group’s belief in the importance of the step forward in terms of European defence, in relation to external relations I would like to say that my group welcomes and supports the decision of this Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan, to the United Nations staff who have died and also in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello. I understand, Mr President, from what I heard in the United Nations last week, that Mr Kofi Annan has agreed to come here in January. I believe we should support that decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, turning to the so-called Conference of Donors in Madrid, our group fully supports the proposal approved by the European Council to contribute EUR 200 million. The only thing we wish to point out is that the US Senate, when President Bush asked them for aid, divided the aid: half in loans and half in donations. In other words, we do not need to go further than the United States which, in principle, has taken a step forward by returning to the United Nations, but in a situation in which it is increasingly necessary to have a timetable for returning sovereignty to the Iraqi people.</p>

Nonetheless the overwhelming feeling of the European Liberal Democrats is one of disappointment at the outcome of the European Council. We fear that it may be recalled, if at all, as a summit distinguished more by what it failed to discuss and agree than for what it actually achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that was not raised is the continued detention, without charge or trial, of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba of whom I spoke earlier. As a symbol for them, I have in front of me 26 candles. I am sorry that the President-in- Office did not respond to my invitation to say a few words this morning about the continued detention of those European nationals and, indeed, of all 600 detainees. It seems to my Group that their detention without charge is a scandal and that the failure of European Union leaders in the Council presidency to keep the matter on their radar screen must be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is no less concerned by the situation in Chechnya. The wrongs which are being committed daily, in the name of the fight against terrorism, will hasten the rainfall of revenge which refills the tributaries of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">With less than two months to go until the end-of-the-year summit, by which time we are supposed to reach agreement on a new Constitution, the presidency had no time to lose. We fear that an opportunity for progress may have been missed. But handed an agenda with little real substance, EU leaders gave back even less. I question whether it was wise for the Italian Presidency not to push for decisions on the Constitution or to make compromise proposals now rather than leaving things to November. That may be too late – politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The lack of proposals has encouraged some countries to retreat from the Convention's agreement, and Poland and Spain to get a hearing for their self-interested sentimentality for the discarded agreements of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial common defence clauses were discussed 'over dinner' but apart from Mr Blair's welcome U-turn on structured cooperation, we appear to have achieved little apart from giving America indigestion. Nor was there substantive progress on economic reform. While we welcome the European growth initiative and the refocusing away from spending on white elephant transport projects towards investment in R&amp;D, the real focus to get back to growth must be progress on structural reform. We would have liked to see the Council putting its legislative money where its mouth is and building the dynamic, open economy we were promised at Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress on Justice and Home Affairs was limited, with little forward movement on the important issues of immigration and asylum. The one positive development, the creation of a European agency to manage the security of our expanding borders, was again agreed beforehand and merely rubber-stamped. The flip side of the coin is the proposal for biometric indicators for passports and visas which should have set civil liberty alarm bells ringing loudly but which seemed not to trouble the summit at all.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, much rests on your November compromise text for the Constitution. It will be your last throw of the dice and we wish you luck since we fear you may need it!</p>

<p class="contents">Our Heads of State or Government have clearly failed to take this piece of friendly advice. The impression that they give of their exchanges on the draft constitution is rather pathetic and takes us back in time: this is Nice all over again. The problem is not that the issues they addressed are not worthy ones. They are, however, entirely cut off from what most citizens consider to be the crucial issues: what are the ambitions for the future Union? How will society’s expectations be met? How much will is there to change the course of the current trend of globalisation? Consequently, the discussions taking place unfortunately resemble a power struggle, lacking any vision capable of capturing the people’s imagination. I believe that the European idea is frankly worth more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">Some observations made by the President of the Commission in his letter to the President-in-Office of the Council also appear to be incapable of stimulating any kind of excitement about Europe amongst the general public. His remarks suggest that European citizens increasingly feel it is important for the Union to press ahead with the structural reforms decided on at Lisbon. These are the proposed reforms on retirement pensions, on social protection, on the labour market, on public services, and yet it is precisely this type of measure that is increasingly frequently setting workers, pensioners and the unemployed, from Rome to Paris, via Berlin, against this caricature of harmonising European policy. What, furthermore, are we supposed to think about the aim stated in the same letter and I quote, ‘to speed up the adoption, at European level, of measures that will enable us to exploit the potential of legal immigrants, while maintaining a firm stance in the fight against illegal immigration’. Does this two-pronged approach really express the concept of Europe-South relations that we wish to promote in the eyes of our fellow citizens? It will definitely grate on the young people who have embraced the idea that another world is possible, a world without predators and without fortresses. These young people feel that a genuine and proactive development policy that gives new hope to the peoples of the South must underpin the solution to the problem of people immigrating in order to survive. More generally, however, is it not time to show the entire European public that the essentially utilitarian and security-based approach to immigration is a dead end, as demonstrated by the unbearable and endlessly repeated tragedies such as the recent example that occurred in the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, lastly, and in conclusion, I wish on behalf of my group to put forward a practical, constructive and achievable proposal, which would enable you to make one of those gestures that honour the Union in the eyes of our fellow citizens, because they really bring to life the values that we claim imbue our texts. This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East. As you know, extremely courageous men and women, both Palestinian and Israeli, have spent two years working on a new peace plan, without sidestepping any of the problems that have impeded all official negotiations to date. Some of these people are eminently representative individuals from the fields of politics, the military and culture, including the former Speaker of the Knesset, Avram Burg, with whom we are all familiar. This plan has just been made public and this afternoon, two of its creators, Naomi Shazan, former deputy Speaker of the Knesset and Mr Jamal Zakoud from the Palestinian Legislative Council will join us. At 4 p.m., they will present their historic initiative to all Members who wish to hear. Beforehand, President Cox will receive them and I wish to thank him for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, that you also receive these individuals and that you honour with your presence, or that at least the Council and the Commission honour with their presence, the formal signing of this peace plan in Geneva on 4 November, the anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination. This would be a gesture for peace and what gesture could better stamp Europe’s identity on the world stage? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President-in-Office, it may be true that six months is too short a time to make any real headway on matters but it is an even shorter time if one has the tendency to waste time holding meetings of Heads of State which serve no purpose, being merely expensive repetitions of debates already held at Foreign Minister level. The Italian Presidency should have presented some conclusive documents at Brussels to attempt to resolve issues which have been staring us in the face for months. There have been enough questionnaires: now it is time to provide some answers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like briefly to mention the Legislative Council. We believe that this is a genuine question of democracy. As Mr Frattini said yesterday, there is a discrepancy between what many governments are imposing and what the overwhelming majority of parliaments wants. The Legislative Council is essential to ensure democratic control and the separation of powers, and, today, we would like your government to provide guarantees on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference, with its gridlock, the debates of pernickety haggling over figures and percentages which are so reminiscent of the nights of Nice, leaves us somewhat nostalgic for the Convention, which, with all its shortcomings, successfully debated the common future of the Europeans and how to govern them.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about the Lampedusa tragedy: these are not immigrants, they are refugees, and there are proposals gathering dust in the Council on the legal framework for immigration and the definition of refugee while the different governments continue to exchange proposals. Mr President-in-Office, find a solution to the matter. That will be worth much more than many words.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of Nice is also hovering over the lengthy list of bridges and motorways which the Italian Presidency and Commissioner de Palacio wish to give us. With regard to the famous list of trans-European transport networks, all we hear today are the cries of the two categories of interested parties: those lamenting the inclusion of a particular tunnel or corridor and those who are champing at the bit and want to start building as soon as possible. There is no discussion of the quality of these investments or whether they are necessary; everyone is treating the issue as though it were a matter of national prestige. Proof of this is the Italian Government’s barely disguised attempt to put increasingly unceremonious pressure on France, which is rightly unsure as to the need for the Turin-Lyon tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">It is genuinely embarrassing, Mr President-in-Office, for a large country such as Italy to have to bargain for an unsustainable tunnel with a dubious electricity investment, especially if we consider the truly non-European nature of Mr Lunardi’s conflict of interests with regard to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue, undeterred, to say that what would help to genuinely boost environmentally and socially sustainable growth in Europe now is a kind of Marshall Plan – a different sort of Marshall plan, promoting useful infrastructure but also renewable energies, land regeneration, research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, kilometres upon kilometres of railway branch lines are closed in the countries soon to join the Union, leaving thousands of citizens with no transport: this is further evidence of the fact that the mobility problems are not going to be solved by the airy-fairy promise of trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Commission not to continue merely to rubber stamp demands from various quarters but to return to its key task: pursuing the interests of Union. It would appear that there is going to be a new list, known as the quick-start list. Without further ado, we would say to President Prodi that we greatly welcome the idea, particularly if this new list is based on the quality of the work and its social and environmental sustainability, unlike the Van Miert list organised by Commissioner de Palacio. We must remember – since the Commission and the Council appear to have forgotten – that Parliament has power of codecision on this matter and we intend to make full use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we see the decision taken by the Council to transfer analysis of the chemicals legislation to the Competitiveness Council as a defeat for all those who care about citizens’ health and as a victory for the great chemical industry. Clearly, the decision was affected by the reluctance and delays on the part of the Commission in presenting its proposal and by the excessive consideration it gave to lobbies, as well as by its serious oversight in failing to incorporate the demands of civil society during an extremely long pretence at consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to protect health and the environment, not to promote competitiveness or trade, that it was decided to draw up a proposal on this matter in 1998. We will hold fast to<span class="bold"> </span>this line and we are ready to give battle, alongside the environmental and consumer associations, out of respect for all those workers who continue to fall ill and die in Europe and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson started with an evocative reminder of the appalling situation in Guantánamo, but I would stress my disappointment at the fact that there has been no mention of the 11 000 prisoners, or detainees, we might say, being held by the United States in Baghdad: they are not Europeans but they, too, have rights. We repeat our proposal once again here: we must suspend the entry into force of the extradition agreement with the United States in order to put pressure on the United States in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, Mr President-in-Office: as you know, the European Parliament is extremely sensitive to the question of its citizens’ rights. In July, Parliament called upon Italy to do something about the case of Adriano Sofri, turning it into a European issue. We are confident that you will respond to that call: you have the capacity to do so. As Europeans, we feel it is genuinely distressing to see the entire Italian Government, and the will of the President, too, so completely at the mercy of the whims of a minister.</p>

<p class="contents">I must first say to the President of the Commission that, for once, I am satisfied with his proposals, and I am similarly satisfied with the proposals of the European Council concerning the initiative for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative is indeed crucial, as is linking private funds to public funds in order to ensure that our economy develops more effectively. For that to happen, however, all of our countries must adopt a number of measures to encourage private investment and, in particular, we must ensure that the red tape of the European Commission and the consequences thereof do not add to the red tape that already exists in each of our countries. Having said that, I believe that this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what upsets the previous speakers is something that I personally find reassuring. By this I mean that some of our fellow Members are rather naïve. There is, as we know, a federalist majority here, which expressed its views when the work of the Convention was approved. This approval was accompanied by a degree of pretentiousness, not to say considerable arrogance, in claiming that the Heads of State or Government, who are in fact the sole source of national legitimacy in each of our countries, would not have the right to table any proposals for amendments whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, these federalist members were also extremely naïve to think that the countries joining the European Union would be satisfied with a minor role for their ‘pretend’ Commissioners. Do not be surprised then, at the results that you get. I agree with Lenin, who said that facts are stubborn: you are facing the facts, so acknowledge them! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Soon, we shall have common monitoring of the EU’s external borders, just as we had in the old days around our own country. The EU state proceeds according to plan. So does the EU Constitution. Work is now being done on the basis of the draft produced by the Convention. There will, however, be a Commissioner from each country, because a number of countries cannot get the Constitution accepted without national Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want the countries themselves to choose the Commissioners and for there to be complete equality between the countries in the chairing of Council of Ministers meetings. There is now a danger of there being group presidencies, with three or four countries leading the EU for 18 to 24 months and, in practice, the possibility of the largest country in the group taking charge of the most important tasks. It would be wiser to continue with the current rotation scheme in which countries can concentrate for six months on delivering a proper presidency. To limit the burden of work, the individual Council formations and, in particular, the 297 working parties in the Council might be given the option of selecting their own chairman from among themselves on the basis of a combination of fair rotation and the chairman’s personal qualifications for presiding over the meetings. Allow me especially to warn against what are known as the passerelles – or one-way motorways – in which the prime ministers are themselves left to define the borders between the EU and the nation states and are able to extend the scope of EU cooperation by means of the flexibility clause in Article 17. They are able to introduce the ordinary legislative procedure and move from unanimity to decisions by qualified majority through Article 24(4) and, for example, with reference to Article 39(8) in the case of foreign policy. If the three methods are combined, almost all issues may fall within EU competence. Instead, for example, of the Danish Prime Minister’s desire for a catalogue of competences with a clear division of power between the EU and the Member States, we get unrestricted prime ministerial government and much more centralisation of legislative power in Brussels. We must now hope that all the EU countries will hold referendums on the draft Constitution. It is absurd that Mr Blair should have held referendums on regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales and on the municipal government in London but will not allow a referendum on Great Britain’s first written Constitution. Take courage, Mr Blair, it is not enough to hold a referendum on a new constitution in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, we have the disunited states of Europe, we have bureaucracies that are destroying each other and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have a Council which was called upon by Parliament in July to appoint a European representative for the Caucasus and, on 4 September, and, again, on 24 September, to appoint a representative for Iraq. We will not be giving anything to Chechnya, suffering from genocide, or to alleviate the situation in Iraq, apart from that shameful little bribe worthy of the dealers of southern Italy, apart from 200 million out of 35 billion. Look at Europe, this Europe! With regard to Israel, Iraq, Chechnya and, I am sure, Guantánamo, Europe roars at the United States and brays at Russia, China, Chechnya and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, then, I cannot say we are laying too much blame at the door of the Italian Presidency. The draft Constitution, which has been laid before us with so much hype, is no more than a formless, empty, pretentious mass which has no basis in the constitutional law with which the world is familiar. As regards the rule of law and the liberal states, it makes overambitious, presumptuous demands, and it cannot even stand the test now, in its initial stages; just imagine how effective it will be when the time comes to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, despite the calls from the European Parliament, you have not yet produced an informal draft on the death penalty and we are almost at the end of the UN General Assembly.

<p class="contents">I feel this sense of frustration firstly because I believe that we have lost the spirit of the Convention, which consisted of seeking the best for the future of the Europe of 25, and my respected friend, Mr Pasqua, recalled Lenin when he said that facts are stubborn. What is more, they really are, because those governments which have to approve the Constitution had a presence in the Convention and actively participated in it, and I believe that nobody should go against their own actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel frustration, Mr President, because I have the feeling that we are going to see over the coming days an attempt to reopen all the issues dealt with in the Convention. The Italian Presidency has sent a proposal telling the governments what has to be dealt with in the Convention. The response has been 150 pages of proposals to reopen almost all the issues that the Convention dealt with. There is also something entirely paradoxical, which is that certain formations of the Council of Ministers – such as the Ecofin Council – are also making proposals to revise the Constitution. The worst thing about these proposals, ladies and gentlemen, is that none of them are ambitious, none of them go further than the Constitutional text. They are cheapskate proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, moreover, the Constitutional text could have been more ambitious. I will give an example of what I mean: Part IV, which refers to the revision of the constitutional text, was dealt with very little in the Convention, due to lack of time, and President Giscard d’Estaing even promised that we would discuss it after Thessaloniki. Well this has not happened. Here we have enormous scope for making specific proposals. There is no specific proposal in this regard, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel frustrated because the spirit of the Convention is a spirit of compromise, but compromise by blocks. But I notice that there are proposals, for example, which seek to reform the budgetary procedure. But this cannot be dealt with separately. It forms a package with the financial perspectives and with own resources. And if we, as the European Parliament, accept the package, we cannot accept now that one part should be left as it is and that the agreement on the budgetary procedure should be broken.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Intergovernmental Conference must concentrate on genuinely political issues, which have not yet been resolved, on which there is no consensus between the governments and which are very simple: the presidency of the Council and the rotating presidencies, the weighting of votes and the distribution of seats in the European Parliament and the number of Commissioners. Constructive proposals – and I would urge the Italian Presidency to make some – must be presented en bloc and must not be piecemeal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore once again failed to understand today – and I say this because I am concerned – the speech by the President of the Commission when he says that the weighting of votes is very good, but that, on the other hand, the number of Commissioners must be changed. We cannot accept the parts of proposals that we want and reject the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to seek a compromise solution and I hope that the Italian Presidency will do so and do so quickly.</p>

Yesterday, however, Mr Frattini and I were able to discuss the matter in depth in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs’ meeting open to the national parliaments, and I want to mention concerns and critical points expressed at that meeting, which have been echoed just now by Mr Méndez de Vigo.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one thing absolutely clear. There is no prejudice towards the Italian Presidency whatsoever in Parliament. Quite the opposite: we know we are indebted to Italy for the major contributions it has made to European integration at crucial times as a founder country. The Italian Presidency’s problem is now how to live up to this reputation, following on in the highest tradition of Italian Europeanism. Why are we concerned? Because a significant number of governments have shown a tendency to challenge some of the most important innovations of the draft Convention. How should we respond to this tendency? That is the question. The way the Ministerial Meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference started alarmed us. We know what happened, even though you have not mentioned it, Mr Berlusconi.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate started with the new development introduced by the Convention’s draft regarding the operation of the Union’s legislative process, which is no longer to be dispersed among the many different configurations of the Council of Ministers, but with legislative powers being concentrated in a single General and Legislative Affairs Council instead. In the questionnaire-based consultation which took place before the debate between Foreign Affairs Ministers, a large number of the governments said ‘no’, although we do not know what their reasons were. However, the representatives of all the governments which are now opposed to the idea had accepted this innovation as part of the final overall compromise of the Convention. The issue of the Legislative Council is not insignificant. I do not have the time to explain why now, but we are alarmed by what happened regarding the issue of the Legislative Council at the Ministerial Meeting of the IGC. The issue cannot and must not be considered closed. If it were to be considered closed, we would not be facing an unacceptable compromise but total surrender.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, just as, with their unequivocal refusals, many governments have put a stopper on the introduction of the Legislative Council, they could do the same thing on other, equally or even more important, key points of the draft Convention. This way of doing things is unacceptable. The Presidency must only take into consideration calls for amendments for which there is clear, long-term justification. It is the Presidency’s task to display the necessary ability for persuasion and drive, confident in the knowledge, Mr Berlusconi, that it represents not only Italy’s position but all the positions and groupings which contributed to the conclusion agreed upon by the Convention. These groupings include the parliaments – we must never forget that: the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments, in other words the direct representatives, legitimised by the vote of the citizens, the peoples of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad consensus and the goodwill displayed by the Heads of State or Government at the inaugural meeting of the IGC in Rome cannot be relied on if the respective Foreign Ministers start to pull to pieces or chop up the Convention’s draft immediately afterwards. Beware of rhetoric! As you said last time – and it had to be said – the European interest must prevail over national interests, but the danger – which is clear to see – is that it is not even the protection of fundamental national interests that will prevail but the upholding of minor positions of interest. Therefore, Mr Berlusconi, we fear that the analogy taken from Hemingway cited in this House by Mr Altiero Spinelli when his draft was being adopted and he was less than certain as to its fate, an analogy used again in recent days by Mr Amato, will become reality. He said that the big fish we think we have caught with the draft Convention is in danger of being reduced to its backbone, for the sharks have taken away the meat. We must do everything possible to stop this happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My hope, right up to the last, will be that the fruits of the Convention mature and are harvested in the interests of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to consult you on two political considerations as you approach the final two months of your presidency. The first consideration is radical, practical and symbolic all at once: we expect the Italian Presidency, together with the Commission, to lay the foundations for genuine-level European financing, controls and sanctions in the field of immigration. We expect more than just general intentions now; we expect progress to be made at last by one of the very countries which is most affected by the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I also expect an initiative from the Council you head on the situation in Iraq. The unanimous vote in the Security Council may lead to a new way forward. The European members of the Security Council have, at last, come to an agreement, and now the Council has to turn that compromise into an initiative: there can and must be a return to multilateralism, we can work together in the field of reconstruction, the humanitarian crisis, security and the democratic transition to Iraqi sovereignty in Iraq under the mandate and guidance of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, as a European, I cannot fail to express my deep concern at the way the Intergovernmental Conference is being conducted. You have confirmed the intention to conclude the work before December, remaining as faithful as possible to the Convention’s text without substantial compromises. However, it would appear that, thus far, the Italian Presidency has limited itself to taking note of and recording the positive and negative opinions of the various delegations on the different issues, with the danger, not least, that debates will be reopened on matters which were considered settled.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, however, as Mr Watson pointed out, does not need a Presidency which is content merely to rubber-stamp initiatives or act as a referee; it does not need pedantic lists of the different demands. Now is the time for leadership which will provide farsighted, wise guidance. President Prodi is right: an inflexible Constitution would inevitably fail. I therefore hope that precisely Italy, which, in 1985, succeeded with the IGC that led to the Single Act in achieving the impossible, will, in 2003, live up to its Europeanist traditions and help to launch a constitutional text which is flexible enough to be workable and convincing enough to be a reference point for European development over the next 50 years.</p>

The policies put forward by the President-in-Office of the Council can only be considered if we disregard the actual situation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk of changes to the pension system in order to preserve social cohesion. Mr President-in-Office, it is sufficient to look at your own country: a general strike of all the trades union has been called for the day after tomorrow in protest against your pensions policy, including the organisations which signed the Pact for Italy with you. Does the fact that all the workers are opposed to a particular policy not tell you something? Does this mean anything to you after the battles in France, after the battles in Spain, after the discontent in Germany, or does it mean nothing?</p>
<p class="contents">You announce pompously that a European Constitution is being launched. Did you notice that two major European demonstrations were held on 4 October in Rome – one organised by the European trades union, the other organised by the anti-globalisation movement – strongly, vehemently criticising this Constitution for the irresolution and ambiguity of its provisions on peace, rights and employment?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, at the Perugia-Assisi peace march, crowds of people of different cultures, religions and political allegiance called for the structure of the Constitution to be changed radically, with rejection of war made its first provision. However, the war continues in Iraq and is polluting the world. Guantánamo and the Baghdad detainees have been mentioned today. We might also look at the measures restricting freedom in the Arab countries in the face of terrorism and war. You have not said how we are to escape from this tragic vicious circle.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about Europe’s Christian roots, but if these roots exist, the tragedy of the Mediterranean, tantamount to a humanitarian disaster, is unworthy of them. How can you fail to see that the quota policy, the immigration policy, has failed? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have spoken in a serious tone about this tragedy in the Chamber. It would be indelicate of me to remind you that your government ministers have said that such immigrants should be kicked out and sent back to their own countries. Rather, I would draw your attention to the failure of this policy, of the policy of control rather than receiving immigrants and creating a different development model.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about an economic policy and you seem not to realise that Europe’s economy is actually in crisis and in decline. You talk of measures and trans-European networks, yet you heard their quality criticised just now. I ask you, however, above all, how you are planning to deal with an economic crisis in the face of the devaluation of the dollar, relentless competition from the United States of America and competition such as that emerging from China? How do you plan to escape from this vice and how do you plan to stop the decline? You continue to cling to the Maastricht policies, to the policies which the President of the Commission once astutely described as ‘stupid’. You can only give any real weight to your policy if you disregard reality. Reality will be your downfall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council wants trans-European networks, but, in practice, Member States baulk at building the few kilometres of track that would make it a little easier for their neighbouring countries to export their own freight. There is talk of the need to offer development opportunities to people in their own countries, but if sugar or cotton are involved, we always allow the economic interests of a small group, of our own population, to prevail over the opportunities of the many people who live in misery, who try to escape from it and then drown on our beaches. For years, we have been talking about the right of the Palestinians to have their own state alongside that of Israel. Where, though, is this effective and credible action on the part of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, one is forced to conclude that such action is required, but where is it? The European Union needs more effective structures in order to act more effectively, without the Member States throwing a spanner in the works. This is why we need this constitution. We always hoped that Europe would become a house for all, not only for citizens and Member States, but also for those people who live in a region that, for some historical reason, has not become a Member State. Why, though, do you not see Europe as a large patchwork of cultures, peoples and regions, where everyone should be offered chances for development? We should take more control of our shared destiny and this should not be thwarted by the prestige politics or short-sightedness of a few Member States. We want a European constitution that is truly a new treaty, which gives the European peoples a new and brighter future and which also grants the regions access to the Court of Justice if their rights are violated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tragedies which have taken place along the coasts of Italy call for the Council to decide to give political refugees the right of asylum, a matter which has been at a standstill for too long, and to clearly condemn governments which do not respect human rights, do not invest in resources to combat hunger and fail to expose terrorist and fundamentalist organisations present on their territory. Europe must make clearer efforts to resolve the Somali crisis, which, since 1991, has seen thousands of desperate refugees die, initially in the Indian Ocean, and now in the Sicilian Channel. These were not just any immigrants: they were Somalis, Mr President-in-Office! You must hold another Nairobi Conference, then, and conclude it with a federative pact between the Somali states heralding democracy and a fight against fundamentalism, terrorism and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Those whose names were on the lists of terrorist organisations issued after 11 September must not be consultative partners either for the individual states or for the Union.

Mr Prodi, Mr Berlusconi, you are arguing over who should take credit for an initiative for growth, an initiative that is a hoary old chestnut of European politics, which has been trotted out for over twenty years and which will gradually lose all substance. As per usual, it looks as though Mr Pasqua will be disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you have not said a word, I am talking about the Council, about what has stifled growth in Europe and which will prevent any recovery, primarily in the Euro zone: the incredible ‘policy mix’, that incredibly stupid policy which condemns the euro zone to both monetary and budgetary rigour. We would have expected the Council to say something about the soaring value of the euro, which is killing our imports, thereby making Europe, the euro zone, the weak link in the world economy. Are currency issues only to be discussed at the G8, with all the consequences that that entails?</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Constitution, without prejudice to the results, I think that the IGC is causing Europe to indulge in institutional navel-gazing, without the public being able to understand the issues at stake, something that the Convention managed to avoid, whatever one might think about the outcome of its work. Well, Mr Berlusconi, you who have managed to be inventive in your own country and revitalise political life by inventing <span class="italic">Forza Italia,</span> please innovate at European level and come up with a European referendum for us because, whatever the relative influence of our governments, of Parliament and of the Commission on the future architecture of Europe, what is lacking, what could be called the missing link, are the citizens: the only way of involving them in this process of building Europe is to hold a referendum, even if some risk is involved.

I have called upon President Cox to send a European Parliament mission to Lampedusa. Europe can come to Lampedusa and other places to see, for instance, the work carried out by Italian policemen, <span class="italic">carabinieri</span> and coastguards, whom I have seen in their patrol boats sharing their ration of food and water and often giving it all to these poor wretches at sea, conveyed by foul traffickers to our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as taking humanitarian measures, however, the States and the European Union have a duty to send a firm, clear, severe warning to the politicians of the immigrants’ countries of provenance, who bear the heavy moral responsibility for not combating this trafficking of human flesh, as it is the duty of all civilised countries to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the High Representative of one of these African countries was our honoured guest, and we even applauded him. He is the leader of one of the countries which has yet to ratify, has yet to conclude the readmission agreements which are so necessary and which are the real guarantee of a policy genuinely combating trafficking of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">We warmly welcome the decision taken by the European Union to include biometric indicators, which are essential for identification, in visas, residence permits and passports. Like you, therefore, we hope that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will adhere as far as is possible to the deadline of 2003 for reaching agreement on the Council’s proposals on this very badly needed measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The activities of previous Italian left-wing governments have, I am afraid, been characterised by huge-scale, foul theft from the people of Africa. I would reassure Mr Barón Crespo that we will ensure that this kind of racism, which is so harmful and so deeply offensive to those peoples, ceases. We will exercise the greatest transparency in giving aid to the developing world. That aid must never again be used – as, I am sad to say, has happened in the past, and we should be ashamed of it – for business or, even worse, as illegal funding for political parties in Italy or other countries, maybe, in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Italian Presidency has so far done extraordinarily good work on the constitutional issue, and I would encourage it to carry the heart of the Convention into the final round of negotiations. At the same time, we should not forget that such concepts as transparency, democracy and efficiency are not simply fine words; they also signify something tangible. That is why the attempt must be made, as regards transparency and the Legislative Council, which the governments see as an irrelevance, but which is for us a significant issue, since the Council is our partner in the legislative process – to get this Legislative Council to really work in a way that brings things into the open and thus to ensure public control. Whatever the difficulties involved, an open-ended form of words needs to be found for this so as not to exclude the possibility of future developments in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The efficiency issue is in fact about the Commission, and it would do no damage if it were possible to leave untouched the Convention’s system as it stands today, with the possible addition of voting rights for all. Whilst I fully understand the Polish and Spanish positions, I would ask you, in the Council, to leave decision-making in the Council just as the Convention has proposed it, but to find some appropriate way of compensating these states, so that sacrifices are not made only on one side. Here too we must not lose sight of the need for efficiency. Criticism of Nice in this House focused on the decision-making methods in the Council, and that is something that we should not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final comment on the Convention. The United States of America has recently made it clear that they have problems with a European security and defence policy. I think that the Convention has been very clear in its formulation to the effect that structural cooperation is open to all and is not intended to adversely affect membership of NATO. This can, if need be, be enhanced, but if there is no structural cooperation in this area, if there is no advance guard to provide a solution to this, then, at some point, a defence union will be established on the continent of Europe, extraneous to the European Union and quite apart from our ties to NATO. Let the Americans, the British and others bear in mind that the alternative would be far worse in terms of their interests, and that they should therefore support the Convention’s approach to this.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to talk not only about the constitution, but also about Europe’s borders. I do not think that <span class="italic">Wider Europe</span> has so far been adequately discussed. We have to clarify the point that an eastward-looking <span class="italic">Wider Europe</span> also means that we have to create a second option alongside full membership. Only if we are able to set limits – which means, in terms of enlargement, that we should, by not enlarging the EU too far, prevent it from being overstretched – will we be able to advance the development of the EU as it is at present. It is for that reason that the second option, in a multilateral form and alongside full Member State status, must be made available to those countries that are not going to join us in the next ten years, whether through lack of desire or capacity to do; this would be something along the lines of a ‘European Economic Area’. I would ask you to show some real initiative in this area over the coming months.</p>

The meetings of Heads of State or Government produce conclusions whose practical content is generally inversely proportional to their length. The conclusions of the European Council are increasingly reminiscent of the pompous resolutions of the now fortunately defunct Supreme Soviet. Three years ago, however, Europe did take a great leap forwards, in the shape of Lisbon, but the fine ambitions set there have evaporated, even though we still intone the mantra that Europe must become the most competitive knowledge-based society, blah blah blah.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the Union does not provide itself with resources that match its ambitions. How can we make our fellow citizens understand that we are in the process of building Europe with a Community budget that stands at around one measly per cent of gross domestic product? The federal budget of the United States redistributes more than 30% of its national GDP. Even the Swiss, who have the reputation of being relatively stingy, redistribute 15% of their GDP through the Confederal budget. The budgets of the Member States cannot make up for an inadequate Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">After three years of mild recession, almost all the States need to address the problem of dwindling resources. They are faced with either getting into further debt or having to reduce expenditure on investment, sometimes both at once. Public investments have fallen in the European Union to around one measly percentage point of GDP. The United States manage 3%. According to the Commission’s own staff, 1% of investment brings with it growth of 0.6%. The Union’s Member States will not get back on track to achieve healthy growth by now limiting their spending on investment and by cutting European citizens’ purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi has just referred to the need to stimulate growth and competitiveness in Europe. In this context, we have just rediscovered trans-European networks, but where is the money to fund them? Mr Berlusconi has spoken vaguely about cofinancing under the Community budget. Mr Prodi spoke about a lever effect, thanks to the Union budget paying for 30% of cross-border transport costs. The Commission document on the European growth initiative only refers, however, to redeploying existing appropriations and does not mention a single extra euro. Since it is impossible to spend the same appropriations twice, using appropriations from the structural funds or even those from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development to finance the TENs will not bring any additional growth. This is a tragic waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is neglecting future spending, which means spending on education, research and infrastructure. The Brussels summit concluded with nothing more to show than pious wishes. We are now told that concrete decisions will be taken on 12 and 13 December. My group, Mr President, will judge the Italian Presidency on these concrete decisions. In order to assist the presidency, we suggest that it take a fresh look at the ideas of Jacques Delors. Why not fund the TENs through a major European loan? The European Union’s debt capacity remains intact. The euro zone has become an internal market in which nearly 90% of trade is conducted between partner countries. Why not be bold enough to launch a policy to stimulate growth that would not work in each country in isolation but which could achieve real results if implemented across Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency has been idle and, at all events, has proved incapable of achieving tangible results. Its predominant silence regarding the tragic developments in international affairs, starting with the situation in the Middle East, is shameful. There will be no peace, there will be no end to the terrorism that we all condemn for as long as Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territories, for as long as the shameful dividing wall remains. The UN is paralysed by US vetoes. The Italian Presidency must take action. Sermonising serves no purpose. It is Europe’s duty to act with great determination, formally recognising the existence of the State of Palestine and promoting the presence of a peacekeeping force that can guarantee respect for the borders of the two States and the implementation of the peace agreements. As regards Iraq, we must demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupying troops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, this will be carried out by finding fault with the Convention, which was the nearest thing to a constitutive assembly and which in every way better represented the citizens. According to democratic principles, sovereignty resides with the people and not with executive governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The antidemocratic nature of this Union does not stop there, however. However much it is proposed to increase the legislative competences of the European Parliament, it will still be the governments of the States in the Councils who will give the go-ahead to European laws and regulations which will then be obligatory for everybody. I would therefore ask that there not be a legislative Council of Ministers but rather a second European territorial Chamber, whose members will be appointed by the parliaments of the States and by legislative constitutional bodies. That would really be a democratic Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it seems to me incoherent to propose changing the current reference to peoples in Article 1 of the Treaty for a reference to citizens when the constitutions of the States enshrine their respective peoples and when Articles 5 and 8 call for respect for the identity of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, however, it is also worth reiterating the references to the recovery of the European economy, which, benefiting from the tail end of an improvement in the world economic climate, has managed to implement a raft of key proposals falling under the European Growth Initiative, with the support of the European Investment Bank and the involvement of the private sector, as has already been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis given to the problem of managing the Union’s common frontiers also deserves attention, with a view to enhancing the safety of its citizens. This is indeed fundamental to defining policies for controlling migratory flows, and illegal immigration in particular. By combating unauthorised immigration, one also combats the networks through which the traffic in human beings passes, as well as all the associated criminal activity. At the same time, as you said, Mr President, one generates conditions under which legal immigrants can be generously welcomed and appropriately integrated into society in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the IGC, however, dominates the agenda, and we therefore feel that this is a good opportunity to call to mind the huge political responsibility incumbent on the Italian Presidency and the governmental representatives who are currently working towards an agreement on revising the Treaties. Without wanting to belittle the value of the work produced by the Convention – in which I had a hand, in any case – the fact is that the revision of the Treaties began, properly speaking, when the Intergovernmental Conference opened. With these words in our minds and on our lips, we nevertheless respect the Treaties currently in force. That is why the Thessaloniki Council treated the Convention as a good basis for discussion and not as a <span class="italic">fait accompli </span>awaiting only the ministerial seal of approval.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, and by way of conclusion, what is expected of the IGC is that, on finishing its work, it should present the national parliaments and the citizens of the Member States with a revised treaty, one whose basic clauses maintain the principle of institutional balance which has from the beginning permitted the interests and equality of the Member States to remain compatible with the requirements of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And yet, the initial meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference give the impression that they are skirting around the subject. They are discussing with great authority and wisdom issues of institutional arrangements, which are indeed complex but ultimately of lesser importance, whilst nothing has yet been said on the most crucial issue, the principle itself of a constitution for a supreme body, which closely resembles a super State, with its supranational decision-making procedures and the absolute primacy of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State or Government are consequently sidestepping the main issue, which is: why should we have a constitution? Is it simply an operation designed to clarify the Treaties? Or is it instead an almost final stage of building the European super-State? Will this super-State meet the needs of an enlarged Europe? Would variable geometry not be a more appropriate solution?</p>
<p class="contents">All of these crucial issues, which are hidden from public view, must be addressed one day, we hope at least in referendums on ratifying the constitution. The further off that day is, however, Mr President, the harsher the awakening will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President-in-Office, you mention competitiveness, economic growth and deregulation. They are all welcome words but they are also well-worn words from past Council statements. The question is whether on this occasion these words will turn into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, it seems again that Europe is more interested in rhetoric than the real reform that is needed to kick-start the Lisbon process. The need for real and far-reaching structural economic reform is pressing. What evidence is there of concrete actions from Member States to implement such reform? The president has spoken of his commitment to implementation of the financial services action plan, but the reality is that progress on the investment services directive has been frustrated just recently by Member States under this presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Low growth and unemployment remain critical issues for Europe: matters that can only be addressed fully by the application of a determined political will to act over the structural weakness of the European economy. But Europe is yet again more comfortable in pressing ahead with constitutional and institutional reform rather than taking practical action which makes a real difference to the day-to-day lives of our constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">There surely was a message for all of us in the Swedish referendum vote. Has it been heeded? The message from Sweden instead appears to have led some Member States to a renewed determination that voters should not be allowed the chance to express their views on the great European issues. Of course in Spain, in Portugal, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland, the electorate will have their say on the constitution in a referendum and I was pleased to note that the Prime Minister of France, Mr Raffarin, has said that it is necessary for a referendum to be held there.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we were all a bit confused last week by the attitude of the British Government on the issue of a UK referendum. Indeed, the government seems to be in complete disarray on the subject: senior civil servants briefing in the UK denying a referendum was untenable; a junior foreign office minister keeping the door open before it was firmly shut by Mr Blair. Eighty per cent of British people want a say in a referendum on this Constitution. Yesterday, my party in the UK launched a petition to our parliament demanding it. The fundamental changes in the relationship between the Union and the citizens of Europe proposed in the draft Treaty will not have legitimacy without the consent of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one other issue that I think has been causing real concern in the UK in recent days: the future of European defence and the Transatlantic Alliance. Our American allies have expressed genuine concerns about the draft Treaty's proposals on defence. The US Ambassador to NATO has said recently that they constitute the most significant threat to NATO's future. The British Prime Minister says the opposite, that he would do nothing to undermine NATO, but this is of course the Prime Minister who assured Britain that the Constitution was nothing more than a 'tidying up exercise'.</p>
<p class="contents">France and Belgium continue to want a separate military structure to be created with a new headquarters in Brussels. We see this as a challenge to NATO's supremacy in European defence. I want to make it clear, to put our position on the record clearly and unambiguously. We believe in NATO as the bedrock of European defence and any initiative that seeks to create a parallel structure within the EU framework undermines that long-standing and proven alliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I gained the impression that Mr Berlusconi was very sincere in what he said, and share his bewilderment. I can also tell him that the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House takes the view that the defence of the external borders and of refugees’ human dignity is not a task for Italy, Spain, or Greece, but for Europe, and we Europeans, from whatever country, must be clear in our minds that Italy is also defending the borders of my own country and those of Ireland. Italy thus has a responsibility to Europe, and we have an obligation of solidarity with Mr Berlusconi’s country.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If it is the case that we have this obligation of solidarity, and if this is a matter of our common European concern, then we can also manifestly rejoice that, within the Council Presidency, this task is in the hands of the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers, Mr Pisanu, whose exemplary approach we very much welcome. We rejoice that it is not in the hands of certain members of your government, who say that, when they see boats full of such refugees, they want to hear the cannons thunder. We prefer the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi, you have again had little to say about the Council’s conclusions on the outcomes of the discussions on judicial and police cooperation. You kept to yourself your thoughts on the statement in Article 34 of the Conclusions that discussion was needed on specific operations to combat serious crime in Europe and on the need for cooperation in this area. When I last spoke, I put two questions to you; I would like to put them again today, and I ask you to give me an answer, as our group regards what you will say in response as a matter of urgent concern. So let me ask you, Mr President of the Council, what you contemplate doing about speeding up the introduction of a European public prosecution service. What, in particular, are you thinking of doing about the introduction of the European arrest warrant? Our intention in introducing a common arrest warrant was to combat the most serious criminal activity in Europe, and I am not repeating this question just for dramatic effect; rather, I want to remind this House that, just in case the European arrest warrant does not enter into force on 1 January, the European Convention on the mutual rendition of offenders expires on 31 December this year, so that the law will be in a weaker position in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As there is danger ahead, we want you to tell us what you are doing about speeding up the introduction of the European arrest warrant. What gives my question ever more urgency is the appearance in today’s edition of <span class="italic">Il Giornale</span>, a newspaper with which you, Mr Berlusconi, may be acquainted, of an article by Mrs Sabrina Cottone from Milan, who interviewed Mr Bossi, in the course of which interview he said, ‘if the European arrest warrant is adopted, it will be a step towards dictatorship, towards terror’. Mr Bossi went on to say that the European arrest warrant is a crime in itself’. I will repeat that quotation: ‘The European arrest warrant is a crime in itself. It would be crazy to adopt it, and if it is adopted, then I will be its first victim’. Well, opinions may differ about that.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to know is whether making the law less effective in the fight against organised crime is one of the EU’s objectives. Ought it not rather, Mr Berlusconi, to be your task, firstly, to put Mr Bossi in his place, and secondly, to do everything possible to enable the arrest warrant to become effective on 1 January 2004? I would be obliged to you if you could answer this question.</p>

After so many debates and so little progress, it seems to have turned into a bad joke. This report by the Council demonstrates once again that we need to cut back on the administrative burden for industry. Nobody will have a problem agreeing with this on paper, but do we really realise what this involves in practice? In the Netherlands, the Finance Minister, Gerrit Jan Zalm, set up a website entitled, <span class="underline">www.administratievelasten.nl</span>, which enables businesses to specify on there exactly what is hindering them in their business activities. I call on you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to do the same in the European Union. We must give victims the chance to speak out. Only if we have a serious overview of administrative burdens, can we set to work. Hence, www.stopeuropeanoverregulation.eu!</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off by saying, Mr President, that from your previous visit to this Parliament, I gather that you like a joke, and I therefore assume that your promises to the Ukraine about EU membership are an expression of your original sense of humour. Surely we should first make a success of the current enlargement, and only then can we think about making new promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For those who were there at Amsterdam and Nice, the Brussels summit is all about <span class="italic">déjà vu</span>. There is, in any case, no denying the fact that representatives of the national parliaments had a hand in the consensus that the Convent painstakingly hammered out.</p>
<p class="contents">The signals sent out from Brussels put me in a thoughtful frame of mind. Europe’s governments may well not have made any headway, but they affirm that they are heading in the right direction. The German Federal Chancellor, Mr Schröder, allows the French President Chirac to represent him. In Europe, we know that nothing can be done without Paris and Berlin, but was it really necessary to put on such a show of strength to deliver a rebuff to all those who warn of a Franco-German directorate?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the growth initiative, with a lot of paper and no action ever since the Essen resolution – as long ago, let me emphasise, as 1994. What this means is that a Quick Start programme is to be put together in time for the December summit, listing the TEN projects that are to be completed. It leaves open the question as to how much money the EU will be chipping in towards the TEN projects, as too, though, is the question of whether the Stability Pact supplants the Growth Pact or vice versa. I would have thought that growth is impossible without stability, for, at the end of the day, today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes.</p>

This is a big task for the Heads of State or Government to take upon themselves in Europe’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">So I also want to ask you – and here I am appealing to the Council and to the Heads of State or Government as a whole – to be really aware of the European point of view and of their responsibility to Europe in the negotiations, and not to get tangled up in trivial national issues. We saw at the last Intergovernmental Conference, in Nice, where that can lead, and that is not the European spirit that we desperately need. People have high expectations, and the Council bears great responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In its fashion, the Convention produced an astonishing good result. I would like to state that it makes an outstanding basis for the deliberations that are now to take place at the Intergovernmental Conference. I would like to point out, though, that a few critical comments do of course have to be made alongside all the positive aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think it right and proper that we should find a place in the preamble of this Treaty for the Christian heritage that has shaped this continent like nothing else, the clasp that holds it together. Let Mr Cohn-Bendit make as much noise as he likes about that, but his roots, too, are in this continent’s Christian heritage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause, heckling and laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Your reacting in the way that you do proves me right.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will have to give some thought to whether the Convention, in part 3, has overshot the mark here in transferring certain tasks to the European level that have not been there before and should not be there now. I would give services of general interest as being one example. If we have a proper understanding of subsidiarity, the European level has no business dealing with services of general interest, nor with the coordination of social and economic policy. I do not know what added value there is for Europe in this area, where a bit more subsidiarity and competition among the Member States is more likely to be of benefit to the internal market in terms of the Lisbon objectives being achieved. The same is true of the rules on access to the national labour markets. These are issues on which decisions are the Member States’ responsibility, and questions to which the public expect answers from the Member States rather than from the European level. If we succeed in resolving these problems as well, we will end up with a Treaty that really does deserve to be supported by people throughout Europe. The most honourable thing that the Council can do is to assume responsibility as representatives of the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we need coordination not only of economic and financial policy, but also of social and employment policy as well. I believe that the initiative for growth and investment, which we are discussing, makes clear how feeble are our conceptions of how growth and employment are to be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to call on the Council and its President to speak in far more definite terms about the approaches we want to take. It is, I think, a good thing that we are going back to the infrastructure modernisation measures and thinking about energy and the environment rather than just transport. I think it right that we should give some thought to research and development, but we must, above all, get a skills offensive started in all Member States simultaneously, as we will not be able to increase growth without skilled people, nor will we be able to become a knowledge-based society in which everyone is able to participate. That is why everything possible has to be done to give us functioning social services, which should, in particular, help to reconcile work and family life, for women are indispensable if we are to achieve the higher employment rate that we need. Sweden, Denmark and Finland have shown the ways in which we can do this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has no lack of sources of funds, and I am not thinking only of the EIB or of the other options available. I cannot but consider the way in which, in this European Union, payment of VAT is evaded to the tune of an estimated EUR 100 billion a year, quite apart from other taxes. That would be more than these EUR 220 billion for ten years, and would enable us to get something really up and running. That is why it really is time for us not to do as your own country does and put our faith in tax amnesties, but to at last get round to coordinating mutual assistance by tax authorities as a means of dealing with the scandalous cross-border criminal activity involving fraudulent invoicing, the motor and mobile phone trades, and the use of VAT evasion as a means of funding other underhand activities; all of these things we must put the brakes on, halt them and put an end to them once and for all.</p>

One must simply trust that, as the prime ministers have had more time to reflect upon the outcome of the Convention and upon the poorer quality of their own proposals, they will be drawn closer to accepting the outcome of the Convention and selling it on to their publics.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that concerns me especially is the absence of a clear schedule for consideration of Part III. The IGC is surely a wonderful chance for us to refresh and modernise the policy chapters, some of which, like the CAP, are 50 years old. If Part III cannot be properly reformed, the IGC must, at least in Part IV, seek to soften the future revision procedures for Part III. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This decision followed on from the statements by Mr Fini, favouring the right of foreigners to vote in Italy and those by Mr Prodi, seeking to pursue his commitment to integration by obtaining new civil and political rights, proves the complicity and the active participation of Europe’s current leaders in the process of opening up our borders to legal immigration and consequently to the eventual mass colonisation of Europe.</p>

I am going to refer to three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the difficult birth of the Constitution. We are impatiently awaiting the proposals which the Presidency—in-Office is going to make in order to try to overcome the outstanding issues in the second half of November and we are glad that we have been told that these proposals will deal with the problem from a global perspective. By global, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, I mean a solution which can affect all the institutions, which can achieve the agreement of all the institutions, and also of all the Member States – some of which have announced that they are going to hold a referendum – and of all the new States – which have also held referendums within another context. I believe, Mr President, that this is an aspect of the problem which should not be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The second difficulty faced by the Italian Presidency is how to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation. Mr President of the Commission, growth, yes, but also stability. We are happy with the Commission's proposed growth initiative, according to which infrastructures must play a fundamental role, because it is usually said, Mr President, that when the Europe of infrastructures, the Europe of construction, goes well, the construction of Europe goes well. There is a simple reason for this: the integration of the markets is not just a political or judicial notion but, above all and fundamentally, a physical notion. Hence the fundamental importance of infrastructures, which – being inert systems – make accumulated delays irrecoverable. Either Europe resolves the problem of infrastructures once and for all or it will have to abandon forever its aspirations to become the most competitive area by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The final difficulty I wanted to refer to in this speech is that of how to restore relations with the United States following the Iraq crisis and following the events of 11 September. I believe, Mr President, that we must place the emphasis on the fundamental rather than on the peripheral. The fundamental thing is a shared history, common values which clash – as our President, Mr Poettering, and others have reminded us – on issues such as Guantánamo and the death penalty, and also our shared passion for freedom. We now have a wonderful opportunity to express the united view of our European Union project at the coming Conference of Donors because – as I had the opportunity to say yesterday in the debate on the budget – the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq is not a responsibility which should fall exclusively to the United States, but to the international democratic community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I said at the beginning of my speech that the Italian Presidency did not have an easy agenda. It is clear, however, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, that without difficult goals no summit is worth climbing. Therefore, Mr President, I would like to wish the Italian Presidency luck and success in the decisive months remaining to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is an example – a further example – of stupidity and short-sightedness, since an even more dynamic and powerful European region in that area would benefit everybody. I hope that President Prodi's announcement of an increase of 30% in the funding of cross-border sections of the European networks will help governments to act in accordance with the conclusions of the Council which they themselves sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of a free Europe without borders is one side of the coin; on the other side are the management of external borders and movement of people. In this regard also there is identical stinginess and lack of ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council is reiterating the global view of the phenomenon of migration adopted at the Thessaloniki European Council; that is important, but admission, residence, integration, border control and the creation of positive dynamics with regard to immigration for receiving countries and countries of origin were dealt with at the Tampere European Council. A legislative programme and coherent and clear political action which make it more attractive to go to a consulate than to put out to sea have been on the table for years, just as we have a European programme for offering justice and security to European citizens on the basis of cooperation between Member States, the cornerstone of which is the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you talk about in the Councils? How can you make generalised statements about fighting crime when what we are waiting for is for you to tell us how and when you are going to adopt the proposals we have on the table, and whether they are going to take effect by the expected date in all the Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there any proportion between costs and outcome? President Berlusconi, you had an opportunity to put a stop to these meaningless resolutions from the summits, and I regret that you did not take it. I also wish to emphasise that I have criticised previous presidencies on the same account. I believe it is important for the summits to be fundamentally reformed so that people regain their confidence in the EU and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">President Berlusconi, you emphasised Christian values in your speech. One of the Christian values I believe that everyone, irrespective of their denomination, should profess is that of alleviating suffering as much as possible.

<p class="contents">The first is that we cannot and must not end this debate without a serious and rigorous political commitment, in order to put an end once and for all to the deaths, exploitation and trafficking in human beings, in other words, to the terrible human tragedies which we see daily on the southern Mediterranean border. Commitments rather than words.</p>
<p class="contents">To the wave of 528 immigrants who a few days ago landed on the Andalusian coasts and in the Canary Islands, we must also add the approximately 70 who, it appears, have died trying to reach the coasts of Sicily. It is very possible, moreover, that today or tomorrow we will continue to add to this doleful list.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message is that the European Union, as such, cannot deal with common immigration and asylum policies unless the agreements which the Member States adopt, either in interesting meetings such as the one that took place in La Baule, which may lead to the beginning of strengthened cooperation in this field, or in the meetings of the Council of Ministers, are not then reflected in cooperative policies which lead to the burdens and responsibilities being shared, both from an economic point of view, and in terms of human and material resources. I believe, therefore, that we need also to provide, for example, for the need to create a European fund for the repatriation of illegal immigrants. There are some countries, such as my own, Spain, which face high costs in cases of repatriation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it is essential also that countries of origin and transit take a much more responsible attitude, and particularly those countries with whom we have association agreements, which should fulfil all the terms of those agreements and not just the economic ones. Equally, within the framework of these agreements, the Commission and the Council should appeal firmly and insistently to countries which, as in the case of Morocco or Tunisia, are the origin of the tragic events I have referred to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can be grateful to Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, for evidently thinking in what are evidently less simplistic ways and for having, moreover, a good memory, as he did indeed say that the European Union’s policies must always be guided by the principle of sustainability, and he reminded us all of the Lisbon process, of which I am sure that you too have some recollection. What the Lisbon process means is that the European Union’s policies must, of course, enable it to compete, whilst always taking account of considerations of the environment and of sustainability. You have managed to insert into the Council Conclusions a statement on industrial policy to the effect that the consequences of all proposed EU legislation on enterprises are to be taken into account by providing a comprehensive impact assessment, and have, by way of providing a good example, immediately proposed starting with chemicals policy, which you, surprisingly, want to have dealt with in the Competition Council rather than in the Environment Council. This was a great surprise – certainly one of last week’s surprising moments – not only for me, but also many of your fellow-members of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Berlusconi, whether you are aware that environmental policy is not just something that we do because we are good or perhaps because we want to try and do things in an ecological way; but rather that we do it because it makes our industry competitive and because it enables us to pass on our planet and our immediate environment to our children, and perhaps because it enables us to maintain the good living conditions that we enjoy. When you last appeared before this House, I asked you whether you intended to apply your strength and somewhat more energy to advancing the European Union’s environmental measures. To that question you would not give an answer. I hope that you will now give me an answer setting out your position on your policies’ ecological aspects and how you personally would assess your resources and the progress you have made so far, precisely what you conceive of as success in ecological terms, and whether you have to date achieved any sort of success in the area of environmental policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to comment on the economic context, also with reference to many of this morning’s interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that there is something wrong in our analyses, something that is wrong somewhere. We have come out of a global World Trade Organisation summit which has not provided the expected results at all, and the word ‘failure’ is a realistic way to describe it; we have a multilateral approach to trade policies which are currently in deep crisis; we must begin once more to ascertain whether the Doha requirements still do not have a basis, or whether the evolution of Doha will lead us to assume other positions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have a situation in Europe where inflation levels are essentially under control; the energy prices are, I would say, fairly stable and financial market conditions are not negative. So the question is: why is there no recovery? And economic recovery depends on series of factors which can only come into play in a European context.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we are reinterpreting a Keynesian model readjusted to present times, but in this Keynesian model we need to speed up structural reforms. When we talk of structural reforms, we also have the political burden and task of leaving behind privileges of position which at this time are becoming onerous with respect to economic developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels proposals are tangible and interesting. We have learned that politics is a job which must produce daily results, and that it is built on the basis of daily efforts and daily work. On 12 and 13 December, I think that we will see much of what was considered at last week’s Council become concrete proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed – the implementation of what has been resolved upon rather than announcements, and a move from enlargement to integration. Not only for the media, but also for many of us in this House, the summit was more about rhetoric than about substance. I cannot deny that I attribute that to the date on which it was held.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourteen days after the gathering in Rome, what really new developments can one expect on the constitutional front? What sort of response did the Commission expect to its Growth Initiative in view of its inadequate preparation and the fact that the EU has no policy on either industry or the economy? Might it not be necessary to combine the Member States’ economic programmes and the Growth Initiative into a package with real financial capacity and to make a statement about who is to do what by when in Europe in order to achieve the objectives that we agreed together?</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke in terms of announcements giving way to the implementation of what has been resolved upon. We do not need anything new. We want Europe to be strong on the world stage and, internally, to be structured on subsidiary lines. We want the Stability and Growth Pact; let us abide by it and implement it. We have the concept of the internal market; let us at last make it a reality. We have competition policy; let us see to it that barriers to competition are removed in every Member State. We have the targets set at Lisbon, Göteborg, and Barcelona; what we need is operational programmes to implement what has been resolved upon, not new announcements.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have before us a balanced basis for decision on the constitution. We all know what points remain to be resolved. While services of general interest are subject to the subsidiarity principle, they form part of the European social model, and so they need a derogation from competition law. Delays will do nothing to resolve these issues. We can achieve the timetable because the issues are still on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly we say both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to a referendum. By that we mean a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a national referendum on reform. I will conclude by putting a question to you. Why, then, do we not start by rethinking this issue too? I say ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide referendum, ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide information campaign, ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide result. That means that the majority of the states and the majority of the votes decide instead of nationalising a European project.</p>

There is evidently little progress to report on that score. What we hear is in any case not so positive in a few respects. It appears difficult to enlarge first and only then to focus on depth. We had anticipated this all along.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing fixation on the ideal of what is termed national sovereignty and national interest sparks proposals that are mainly focused on the question as to how we can frustrate the decision-making process in Europe. This is the central idea of most of the attempts to change the outcome of the Convention. Some want to maintain veto rights, while others want to reduce the blocking minority and yet others want to structure the Commission in such a way that all objections related to the Council decision-making process return to the Commission. This would render the Commission a weakened body of national prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with reference to what Mr Karas stated, we are facing all these national referendums which, together, form a very undemocratic decision-making tool, because one small majority in one country can cause the whole of Europe to grind to a halt. If that is democracy, then I do not know. All of this is at odds with the intentions of the founders of European integration. They succeeded in starting this gigantic innovation because of a broad European vision. Had they remained stuck in a mosaic of small-minded, national interests, then Europe would have remained a platform for power games, violent or not, as the case may be. We must continue to call a spade a spade. A Commissioner who fails to prioritise the European interest but represents his own national interests is a corrupt Commissioner who must be brought down. Parliament should not be reduced to a collection of errand boys of Member State governments. After all, we are the direct representatives of the European citizens. It is unfortunate that in some new Member States, leading personalities do not, for demagogic reasons, distinguish between the roles of Brussels and of Soviet Moscow. It is very obvious where the differences lie: participation, free will, and so on. When we were faced with the choice of a free trade zone, personalities of that ilk always emphatically rejected that alternative. We hope that the enlargement, which for a long time was our fondest wish, will considerably reinforce the European idea, for that is its objective.</p>

I welcome your choice of a multidisciplinary approach to deal with this, taking in the securing of the external borders and accelerated asylum procedures, along with measures to deal with immigration, steering the legal and combating the illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to make a number of specific comments, starting with one on the management of the external borders. If we want to have a whole range of projects to manage the external borders in new ways, with very high standards enforced everywhere, then coordination is needed. The Commission and the Council have now proposed the establishment of a new agency, but the question arises of where it is to be located. I would not be in favour of our again devolving competences upon an agency over which we have no control; I would instead prefer it if a coordinating unit – which might as well be called an agency – were to be set up within the Commission, where it could function efficiently. I would ask you, when evaluating the options, to give consideration to this one.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment has to do with repatriation policy. If you want to put together credible policies on asylum and legal immigration, you have to combat illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum, and so you need a common repatriation policy as well. I would encourage you, then, in future, to conclude repatriation agreements not only with states like Macao, but also, in fact, with the states from which we can expect the most migrants. That is what we expect, and we will support you in doing this. We will also help you to work towards the provision of information at the grass roots in these countries, which is the best way of preventing the trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">For my final point, I ask you to exert more pressure on the Member States to get them, at last, to implement the directives on refugee status and asylum procedures, so that we can, once and for all, ensure that decisions are taken and procedures completed speedily, and that refugees get help without delay.</p>

One could hardly expect the Council to do other than give attention to the situation in the Middle East and lament the way in which this has deteriorated, which it has done, also calling on both sides to renounce violence and enjoining a policy of moderation upon them. Today, Mr President of the Council, I would like to call upon you to do everything you possibly can, whether through official or unofficial channels, to give real support to all the peace initiatives, whether they be Palestinian or Israeli in origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, I am referring here to what are termed the Geneva Accords, a splendid initiative by people who really have been involved for years with the whole complex process. Let me make an exception here, and quote from an author – Amos Oz, an Israel writer who has this to say in a commentary on these Geneva Accords: ‘Ever since the Six Day War, we are as close to the Palestinians as a jailer is to the prisoner handcuffed to him. A jailer cuffing his wrist to that of a prisoner for an hour or two is a matter of routine. A jailer though who cuffs himself to his prisoner for thirty-six long years is himself no longer a free man. The occupation has also robbed us of freedom.’ These words, I think, clearly express the need for the European Union, too, to contribute something towards putting a stop to this state of non-freedom, which this situation has caused to prevail in Israel itself, and the fact that the Geneva Accords provide us with a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few days, though, have also shown that the conflict in Palestine and the situation in Iraq are even more closely connected than we, in this House, had repeatedly claimed them to be. Although, Mr President of the Council, there is at present rejoicing at the unanimous adoption of the United Nations resolution, we must not abandon the objectives that this House has always pursued in relation to Iraq policy: a strong role for the United Nations and a progressive but speedy and clearly-defined transfer of power from the Americans, from the armed forces, to the Iraqis. Iraq belongs to the Iraqi people, and it must be made apparent, unambiguously and relatively quickly, that the European Union wants to implement this principle and put it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not very happy about the way in which the agreement with Iran came about. I would have preferred it if it had been reached by Mr Frattini, the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, in tandem with Mr Solana, the High Representative. We should, though, be glad that the three European foreign ministers have managed to come to an agreement with Iran. Agreements can be reached without war, they can be reached by peaceful means, they can be reached by negotiating with countries that put up resistance, and we should rejoice that this important agreement with Iran now appears to have been concluded.</p>

Instead, we all know the way things turned out: in the end politics prevailed, the sense of responsibility prevailed and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, despite the initial criticisms, achieved the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in this Chamber, I have heard certain pessimists making predictions about the outcome of the IGC which are not positive. Naturally, no one believes that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will not come up against obstacles. No one believes that it will all be easy, but I am convinced that in the end, as in the case of the Convention, the European interest will prevail. This is why I am optimistic, this is why I am convinced that this Presidency will make Europe take significant steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible not to welcome with satisfaction the statement made by the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, or to welcome with just as much satisfaction certain affirmations made by President Chirac? Politics is mediation, not propaganda; it is the ability to attain the goal within the prearranged time. I am convinced that this Presidency, therefore, will attain the objectives which it has set itself: Europe will have, before the next European elections, its first Constitutional Treaty, fruit of the valuable work of the Convention and also fruit of Parliament’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s active participation in the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference is an extremely positive result, and this choice is proof of the fact that the Italian Presidency has maintained its promises made in this Chamber. I cannot fail to stress the importance of reference to our Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution. It is not, Mr Barón Crespo, a question of a monopoly, but quite the opposite; it is that we must not dismiss the contribution that Christianity has made to the moral and social growth and development of this continent. I am referring to the values which Mother Teresa of Calcutta embodied and observed: values which we all, believers and non-believers, share.</p>
<p class="contents">Also when we talk about the major, difficult issue of immigration, Europe cannot fail to hear the cry of pain uttered by millions and millions of Africans. Africa, with its tragedies, will constitute the emergency of the coming decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, confirm that the approach to this great emergency is the right one. Carry on! As many fellow Members asserted today in this Chamber, Europe – the whole of Europe – has to take responsibility, in political and economic terms, for organising and protecting the borders. The road embarked upon by the Italian Presidency, I repeat, is the right one. This is why we should encourage and support it, just as it should be supported, Mr Bertinotti, in respect of development policy. How can we consider increasing the competitiveness of our regions without putting in place major infrastructure in order to develop the internal market and to create new jobs?</p>
<p class="contents">Carry on with the decisions concerning Lisbon too: without a serious reform of welfare systems our young citizens will not be offered any hope. Social-democratic Germany has embarked on this path, as has centre-right France. These are not, therefore, choices made by one side or the other, but it is a question of political farsightedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision promoting research is also positive: it was a promise made in this Chamber in July, and has been kept; just as the fight against organised crime is a promise.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that Mr Schulz reads Italian newspapers attentively. Allow me to supplement his press review with some news. It is well-known that, with regard to the European Prosecutor, the Italian Government and the current Union Presidency have decided to adhere to the text submitted to the European Union by the Convention. With regard to the European arrest warrant, as is just as well known – it is in the Italian press – the draft law to modify Italian regulations in line with the prearranged framework-decision at European level has already been tabled to the Council of Ministers and will be discussed soon, before being submitted to Parliament for adoption by 31 December this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, therefore, in my opinion, this House, despite a few deliberately provocative interventions related to political affiliation, is encouraging the Italian Presidency to move forward along the road on which it has embarked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made careful note of all the speeches; we will take them into account during the 50 working days which we still have before the European Council in mid-December.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been remarks from many quarters regarding the achievements and work of this Presidency. I would simply like to point out that it really is difficult – and I personally have experienced this – to address all the issues involved in holding a Presidency, in the very short space of time available; all the more so for those holding the Presidency in the second half of the year, as this space of time is reduced, in practice, to just four months. In July and August, we did try to hold meetings with Heads of State or Government, but it was virtually impossible and we confined ourselves to the possibility of bilateral talks. Therefore, in terms of actual working time, for a Presidency with this mandate during the second half of the year, four months are left. Then there is the Christmas period, with the last European Council being brought forward to 12 and 13 December as a result, and so there truly is very little time available. This means that we must look closely at the proposal in the draft Constitutional Treaty which provides for presidencies lasting two and a half years, with the possibility of renewal. The hope is that it will be possible to find an influential President, who can represent our Union on the international stage with authority, and who also has the necessary time, maybe, to manage the rotating systems according to which the European Council operates, which of course cannot be done in too short a space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you, however, that during this period, the Italian Presidency has endeavoured to discharge its responsibilities. Just to try to explain how many things a Presidency has to do, I will tell you what we have done: we have held over 42 meetings with government representatives of Community countries and candidate countries; we have ended several old disputes which no previous Presidency had resolved; we have chaired 26 Ministerial Council meetings, along with all the work also required from the President-in-Office personally in preparing for these European Councils in the various sectors and in coordinating the Councils themselves; we have adopted 17 regulations and directives; we have concluded three conciliation procedures with the European Parliament, which had been ongoing for some time; we have concluded or signed seven international agreements; we have begun the technical review of the texts adopted by the Convention – all of this involves numerous sittings, and almost always at night, what is more, for the President-in-Office; we have held eight Association and Cooperation Councils, including Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, Tunisia and so on; we have had 10 summits and troikas, and moreover, this very week I am going to China; we have held 30 COREPER meetings, along with all the preparatory meetings; we have had 15 working meetings with representatives of the United States, Russia, the Balkans, Latin America and other countries; lastly, we have held over 800 Council working group meetings. The future Presidency of the European Union must therefore be highly structured and must be assigned to someone with the youth and energy to sustain this level of obligations. I am too old, Mr Schulz, for this kind of thing; but thank you anyway.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I would point out that it was opened 18 days ago. The Presidency initiated a debate, which was open albeit brief, that could not and cannot be prevented. In fact, I do not believe that it is conceivable in a college of Heads of State or Government, to refuse or deny each government the opportunity to set out the position of their country on a constitutional treaty. The Presidency’s task was to listen, to expand upon each topic of discussion and it will subsequently be to condense this all into a global proposal, which is exactly what we are preparing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues which are still unresolved, as you know, mainly concern institutional questions: the double majority voting system, the composition of the Commission – as has been widely pointed out here – the review of the Constitutional Treaty with the possible extension of qualified majority voting to other areas. I expect, within a few weeks, when we have completed the detailed – but, I repeat, open and transparent – examination of all the issues before us, to draw up a global proposal. It will be my job to contact, on a bilateral basis, the relevant persons in the different countries in order to discuss it probably at an informal meeting of the European Council, between 15 and 30 November and, at last, have the final proposal ready in mid-December.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, of course, is clear, and that is that Europe and its citizens expect a high quality Constitutional Treaty; that is, an end product equal to the challenges to which we will increasingly be required to respond. We cannot accept compromises which reduce the European Union’s ability to make decisions and to make them swiftly and efficiently; we therefore cannot conceive that the defence of individual national interests – which is, however, right and understandable – could stop us having a constituent result necessary to consolidate the integration of Europe which is enlarging and uniting with an ever growing number of new Member States. In December, when the Presidency’s global proposal has been considered, expanded on and discussed, the time to decide will come. We will ask everyone to endorse, with clear and transparent responsibility, a complete constituent draft which, I repeat, must be high and noble. Failing this, European citizens will be called to vote in June without any knowledge of the new institutions and the faith of these citizens in the European Union and its progressive integration would be lost or be greatly reduced. This integration is a decisive factor in meeting the challenge of making Europe capable of taking a leading part on the international stage, capable of facing, with dignity, any other international power on equal terms, capable not only of strengthening the democracy, freedom, well-being and security of its citizens but also of disseminating these resources throughout the world. It is worthwhile considering this very point because we have all made a commitment, again recently with the Millennium Declaration, to give food, water, heath and education to those in the world who do not have them. These are important material resources but we know full well that, if they are not preceded by the first resource, that is freedom – which results in democracy as a form of government- then there is no possibility of providing and guaranteeing these resources in the long term to those citizens of the world who are still lacking them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that when assessing – as I have been doing during recent days and nights – the final articles of the Constitutional Treaty, we must be clear that this Treaty will be in force for our fellow citizens for the next 10, 20 years, and that it must give our Union, as the seat of the most ancient civilisation, as a group of states and citizens which identify with a common heritage of values, principles, cultures and civilisation, the chance to be a protagonist in the world, to carry out, together with other countries and not in conflict with other countries, the duty of exporting to the world precisely that important resource of freedom and democracy, which alone can guarantee well-being for the people, which alone can effectively guarantee a truly peaceful future for the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other more specific matters, which Mr Tajani has already answered in part, such as the European Prosecutor. We shall abide by the draft Constitutional Treaty. As far as the environmental dimension is concerned, I would point out that paragraph 24 of the Conclusions includes the environmental dimension in the growth process as a factor which will work as a catalyst for innovation and modernisation in key sectors such as energy and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to remind you that, in effect, we have already obtained tangible results, and this gives us hope for the further deliberations of the Intergovernmental Conference. We have obtained results in an area where there were seemingly insurmountable divisions: European defence. The work of this European Council – which will take tangible form in the Council’s work in December – has given rise to the realisation by all the countries of the European Union, including the 10 new countries which are joining us, that there can be no true European Union foreign policy which carries weight, which is authoritative, if we are not backed up by an independent European defence force.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of enhanced cooperation – or structured cooperation, as the case may be – has also been accepted, a system which allows certain countries which have greater military capacity and have the possibility and intention of spending on defence, to join together, but on three very clear conditions. Firstly, that this cooperation is open at all times to all Member States of the European Union which wish to participate in it; secondly, that the criteria and rules according to which this cooperation is set in motion do not stem from a decision made by the States which initially establish this cooperation, but are approved by the European Council. It will be decided in December whether this approval must – and I hope not – be given by unanimous voting or by qualified majority voting. The third condition is that European defence must not be seen as an alternative to NATO but as a complement to NATO itself, which we still consider to be one of the pillars that has ensured over half a century of peace and security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only promise you all that we will approach these final 50 working days with the greatest dedication and, with regard to the Constitutional Treaty, with a clear idea in mind at all times. We will not be able – just for the pride and satisfaction – to close the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency. Such a thing has never happened before, because the five Intergovernmental Conferences which preceded this latest one opened under one Presidency and always closed under other Presidencies. We, too, even though we are trying to arrive at a conclusion and even though we know that the European citizens will be summoned to the polls next spring and that we must therefore do everything possible, or rather, more than everything possible, in order to let them know what the roles and overall ambit within which the Parliament whose Members they will be called upon to elect will have to operate, will never agree to go so far as signing a compromise, a Constitutional Treaty, which cannot assure Europe, and by extension its citizens, that it will perform what we all believe must be its duty in the coming years. The Italian Presidency will therefore do all it can to complete the work by December, but will not allow this work to result in a watered-down Constitutional text, which favours the interests of individual States rather than defending the common interest of us all, which is, of course, the common good.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for this debate, which has been extremely interesting and which has provided us with ideas for our future action. I thank Mr Berlusconi for the desire he expressed to close the Intergovernmental Conference with a powerful, and not a watered-down text, and I also thank him for having stressed the need for a sense of continuity in the institutions, and the difficulty of this continuous, fast rotation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of its duty to ensure the continuity of the institutional work of politics: we have done so throughout recent years consistently, loyally and with dedication, and indeed, this very evening, I am going to Dublin for talks with the Irish Prime Minister, precisely to ensure this continuity and so that the work we are doing is not fragmented by the continual changes that take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the issues that we must touch on, I would like to make some very simple observations. Many interventions referred to the question of the Commission’s composition. I would like to clarify once again that the draft Convention already includes one Commissioner per Member State. What we do not accept is that half are working Commissioners and half are ghost Commissioners; but there is already one Commissioner per Member State.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must make all Commissioners visible with the same powers and able to lay down European policy. It is by no means the case that having one Commissioner from each Member State would mean that national interests are represented: already, in the present Commission, the Commissioners, I am glad to say, do not represent national interests but the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem which has emerged and which is of great interest was mentioned by Mr Bonde. I was a little surprised, I must say, when he came out in favour of a referendum in each Member State, because I thought that he agreed with the principle of subsidiarity, whereby each country chooses the method with which to adopt their Constitution. If a referendum is necessary – as Mr Karas said a while ago – then we should have a European referendum.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You understand, then, that it would all take on a different significance: all we would need is the Constitution as decided here, approved by a European referendum, and it would assume infinitely greater significance, it would be something altogether different. I really would ask you to reflect on this. I know full well that it sounds too good to be true, but there are times in history when a decision of this kind is sufficient to change the face and life of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue: the quality of investments. The quality of investments was raised, and I would like to clarify that the quick-start list is not going to create priorities and exclusions. That is not what we intend; rather, we want to identify the projects which are the most mature, most transnational, most likely to mobilise resources and confidence rapidly. Confidence, Mrs Frassoni, also and above all means social and environmental sustainability, in line with the policies of the Commission, which, over recent months, let us not forget, has sought to establish itself in the highly sensitive area of energy policy, dedicating a large part of our resources to research into hydrogen and alternative energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the extremely sensitive question of the protection and health of the environment and the chemical industry was raised. It may, indeed, be the case that we have had to make compromises, especially at a difficult time in terms of the economy: I do not rule that out, because we have to make compromises every day, but I want to assure Mrs Frassoni that we are at the forefront of the world – very much so – with the substantial costs that this entails. However, we want to be, as we were for Kyoto, because we know full well that, as the European Union, we have to shoulder a responsibility which is distinct from the responsibility shouldered by the individual countries, the individual nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as the European Union, we have to shoulder responsibility – and here I am looking at the candle, the large candle, still alight in front of Mr Watson – with regard to the Guantanamo issue, on which I cannot fail to agree with the concerns expressed regarding the state of the prisoners. Without making simplistic judgments, I can say that, if a case of this kind happened within the European Union, it would probably be considered under the scope of the procedure laid down by Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we must also recognise that detainees in the Member States are detained precisely in the Member States, and we must make it clear in practical terms that we expect these citizens’ rights to be vigorously defended by the authority of their States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to conclude the foreign policy issues, Mr Wurtz made strong reference to the Geneva Plan. I was very pleased by this because it is the first time that a practical initiative has been put forward by the Palestinians and Israelis and not by the – albeit extremely valuable – initiatives of the Quartet and external bodies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They will not be representatives of the governments of both sides, but they are representatives of enormous intellectual and moral stature. I would like to remind the President of Parliament here of the skill with which the Speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, led the Israeli Knesset at difficult times and the very real enthusiasm he generated with his speeches, his discussions and also his critical remarks. They will make a contribution, which I hope will be decisive, to peace in Israel and we, I can assure the honourable Member, will be ready to seize it with the sensitivity necessary in these cases. It is clear that this is a Palestinian and Israeli process, not a process conducted by the world powers relating to Israel and the Palestinians; it is from these quarters that we are awaiting a message that will enable us to achieve peace in the Middle East together.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to immigration, Mr Brok referred to the European policy which he called ‘wider Europe’; I prefer to call it the ring of friends policy, that is the policy of having around us – from Moscow, from Russia to Morocco – countries with which we have a close, solid relationship based on friendship. This is the implementation of ‘soft security’, of that security policy which Europe has entrusted to dialogue, to economic bonds, to cultural bonds. It is in this context that we must place the issue of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already taken two major steps forward: cooperation on policing – which really is a step forward – and the agency to coordinate our action. Mr Pirker raised some legitimate objections with regard to the agency and the danger of duplicating it. However, we want to ensure, precisely, that this is a body at the service of the European institutions to coordinate our action.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first part, but it is not enough, it is not enough! This is a means of internal defence, but we need an initiative to manage and keep the immigrants in their countries of origin. Clearly, therefore, we must make a twofold agreement with these countries, on the protection and the control of immigrants, giving them the possibility to interact and also to reap a legitimate benefit from this. The quota policy, rejected by the Council, perhaps partly because the term ‘quota’ is inappropriate, is absolutely essential. I would call it an agreement with these countries to guarantee them a minimum emigration level so that they help us to protect our borders. There is no alternative: if we live among friendly countries, we will succeed in resolving this tragic problem; if we do not live among friendly countries, they will continue, with a hostile approach, to send us emigrants, exploiting them, and we will no longer know what position to adopt or what decisions to take. We should remember this: initially soft, passive defence, and then an active agreement with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, many of you rightly raised the question, the fear of falling into the clutches of economic decline. This is a serious, disbursing problem, which combines with the concerns that the German, French and British Governments have, together, expressed over the risk of European deindustrialisation. We must not forget that this is an extremely serious matter, upon which we will have to reflect and work in the future because we cannot accept protectionist solutions which would leave us even worse off. Together, we must, by applying the lessons of Lisbon to this new situation, give Europe the impetus it needs. The fundamentals of our economy are strong, and are much stronger than those of other economies which are currently lecturing us and telling us how to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember, however, that, although they are necessary, the structural reforms which Mr Fiori rightly mentioned in his speech do not suffice. We need energy and coordination between us all, a sense of mission, of what everyone expects from European politics. We are experiencing a highly absurd situation: all our governments and countries are expecting us to provide an industrial policy, a financial policy, a common and coordinated research policy to free us from those clutches of economic decline; the peoples are calling for this, the governments are calling for this, but then, when it comes to taking the necessary steps to resolve the crisis and achieve these objectives, that is when national interests, fears and conservatism prevent us taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been experiencing this absurd situation for too long; we must find a way out, and Parliament and the Commission are being called on by the European peoples to overcome this very situation. Together we have to do this.</p>

It is unacceptable to continue giving priority to enhancing the competitiveness of businesses on the basis of further liberalisation and privatisation, further pay cuts and flexibility, instead of solving the problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the so-called ‘European Initiative for Growth’ will fail as long as the limitations imposed by monetary policy remain in place. Those limitations also bring the risk that funding for large projects will come to depend on the whim of the financial markets. The Stability Pact needs revising more than ever, in such a way as to take into account employment, education, training and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Intergovernmental Conference, what was revealed there is worrying, especially the unacceptable financial blackmail practised by some Member States, who are threatening to block the Community budget so as to obtain an agreement based on the so-called European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally regrettable that the Council has not put in place the measures needed to bring an end to the occupation of Iraq, so as to ensure that the Iraqi people will be able to claim their inalienable right to determine their own future and exploit their rich resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
