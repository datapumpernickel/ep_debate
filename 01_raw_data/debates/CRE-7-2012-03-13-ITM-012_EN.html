Frankly, it is hard to imagine a world without the Internet and the Internet constitutes a vital tool when it comes to exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is very important, touching upon two of the most fundamental principles of the European Union: freedom of expression and non-discrimination in an open and secure Europe. As the Presidency, we are very much aware of the concerns of this Parliament when it comes to the possible misuse of Internet sites and of the specific reasons which have led this debate to be placed on your agenda this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that while discussing this issue, we must distinguish between law and politics and, legally speaking, it goes without saying that there is freedom of expression in Europe. It is a cornerstone in our democracy and must be cherished. It is clearly stated in the Charter and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human Rights that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the right to hold opinions and receive and impart information and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I need not remind you that, according to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union shall accede to the Convention on Human Rights. This debate also relates to the principle of free movement of workers, which is a pillar of the European Union. However, freedom of expression is not equivalent to the right to express anything about everyone. Freedom of expression should be exercised within a certain framework in order to protect other fundamental rights. So, establishing this framework can be brought about by legal remedies in national legal orders and, to some extent, also at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically speaking however, I want to make it quite clear that I and the Danish Presidency condemn any form of discrimination. The Council also cherishes the principle of non-discrimination and all activities of the Councils are carried out in respect of this fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will understand that my comments this afternoon are necessarily brief and limited in scope. That is because the Council has neither discussed nor adopted a position on the issue of government reactions to Internet sites which raise questions concerning discrimination. As far as any specific comments this Parliament has in relation to reactions from any particular Member State, it is not for me representing the Council as a whole to take a view on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, finding the right balance between freedom of expression and non-discrimination is a very important task and I very much look forward to hearing your views on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I called on all citizens of the Netherlands not to follow the intolerance of the PVV website and I commend the very strong reaction that they have shown. The Dutch complaints bureau for discrimination on the Internet has received well over 6 000 complaints from citizens and, in addition, many political parties in the Netherlands, including those from the majority, have dissociated themselves from this website.</p>
<p class="contents">The response by Dutch business leaders is particularly welcome. They have condemned the xenophobic nature of the website and warned about its damaging effects on intra-EU trade for the Dutch economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also applaud the fact that the European parties have raised their voice. I cannot quote all those who have been very outspoken on this, but the President of the EPP has said ‘I am angered’; ALDE has said that the website goes against all European values of dignity and liberty. President Martin Schulz has given his analysis that the website shows completely unacceptable behaviour. I would like to recall that ten ambassadors have written an open letter in which they express their concerns about the discriminatory and stigmatising nature of the website, saying it was a deplorable initiative. I would like to quote the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General, who wrote that he is concerned because the website is hosted by a political party which is linked to the governing coalition, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add to this that it is unacceptable that EU citizens should become the target of xenophobic and intolerant attitudes because they have exercised their fundamental freedom to move from one Member State to another. The citizens of the 27 Member States have the right to move, work and study wherever they like and they should feel at home no matter where they decide to move. All governments have the duty to ensure that EU citizens from other Member States feel welcome. They must explain to their citizens the important benefits the free movement of citizens has for the economy and for our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Framework Decision on combating Racism and Xenophobia obliges Member States to make intentional public incitement to hatred against persons punishable. Incitement to xenophobic hate is an offence in Europe, so it is for the Dutch authorities to investigate fully the lawfulness of this website under Dutch law and under Union law. I applaud the joint motion for a resolution by the PPE, the Socialist Group, the Liberals, the Greens and the Communists. That is the right way to proceed: to say altogether, ‘no, there is a limit to what one can do’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is founded on the values of democracy, non-discrimination and the rule of law. These have to be respected by all, including by national politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold?</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values.</p>
<p class="contents">We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion.</p>

I must say that it was a silly statement. Let us now speak on the real subject. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> For many years and even decades, we have been attempting to create a new Europe with as few borders as possible. A Europe in which everyone feels at home, in particular, as Mr Daul mentioned, our fellow Europeans, the citizens of Eastern Europe, following the fall of the iron curtain. For the members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, there is only one Europe. Whether people come from the east, west, north or south, they are all inhabitants of this continent and they deserve our respect. They are all people who can make mistakes and who may occasionally create an unpleasant impression in their neighbourhood. However, there is no difference between the people from the eastern and central parts of Europe and those from the west.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to create a Europe of this kind with all the fundamental freedoms and with the opportunity to work anywhere in the continent. The developments that have taken place in this area are very poor. We have already discussed this today in the context of the threat of suspending the Schengen Agreement. The previous Danish Government suddenly expressed the desire to close its borders. Quite apart from the fact that it currently holds the Presidency of the European Council, I am very grateful to the current Danish Government for reversing this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one government which is continuing to prevent Romania and Bulgaria from joining the Schengen Area. This happens to be the Dutch Government. Quite by chance, this is the same government which is working together with the party that has created this dreadful website. I can only repeat what Mr Daul has already said on the subject, because despite all our differences, Parliament must take a joint approach. This website is totally unacceptable and goes against all our European values. It must be shut down by the people responsible, who should realise that this is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most unacceptable aspect of all this is the failure of the Dutch Government and the Dutch Prime Minister to react. He recently said to me in the course of a conversation that it was not their website and it would be even better if a government were to set up a website like this. Nevertheless, this is a party which is cooperating with him. It may not be a formal alliance, perhaps it is an informal one, but in any case, they have a relationship. They are sleeping in the same bed. The government should not be doing this with a party which creates a website of this kind. Therefore, I can only say once again to Prime Minister Rutte: we are waiting. We are still waiting for you to distance yourself from this. We do not want you to call in the police to close it down if this is against the law, as Ms Reding has said. However, we are waiting for Mr Rutte to make a clear political statement indicating that he is opposed to the citizens of the European Union being treated in this way and that he also opposes racism and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Reding – even though you did not mention one of the first statements by the S&amp;D Group, but that is not what we are discussing – that it is important for us to take a joint approach in this matter. It is important for our group and the entire House to stand up against racism and discrimination in Europe. Mr Rutte should take note of this and he should respond to this call.</p>

We made that clear straight away. It is really unacceptable and it is a disgrace that something like this is still possible today in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that initiative did not just come out of nowhere. That initiative was no accident. The actual reason for this initiative by Mr Wilders’s party lies in the sudden collapse in his party’s support in the opinion polls in early January and a subsequent loss of seven seats. It was, indeed, the first time that this had ever happened to Mr Wilders’s party. The reason why that happened is quite simple. Mr Wilders was simply unable to stop carping at people. He heaped criticism on Queen Beatrix for wearing a headscarf during a state visit to Oman. He started attacking her and Wilders’s criticism of their queen did not go down very well with the Dutch, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">And, so, what did Mr Wilders do? He immediately tried another tack with another issue. This time, the target was not the Royal Family; this time, it was the Eastern Europeans. He opened a complaints website where people could complain about the presence in the Netherlands of Poles, Slovaks, Bulgarians and other Eastern Europeans. That is the real reason why this complaints website was set up.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I totally agree with Mr Daul that the Dutch Government’s silence was, in fact, unacceptable. Whether or not this is a party question, as the Dutch Government claims, is, in fact, irrelevant. I think that we all have the right to know what the Dutch authorities actually think of an initiative established by one of its illustrious citizens somewhere on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can tell you, Mr Daul, is that I have, at any rate, personally tackled Prime Minister Rutte over this. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I hope that you do the same thing with Mr Maxime Verhagen because, as you know, it is not just Mr Rutte’s position; it is a position of the Dutch Government and, thus, of the two parties in power. It would be wise for you, too, to intervene to encourage the Dutch Government to take a position.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we also know that what is happening in the Netherlands is not an isolated event at present. There is something more serious going on in Europe. When I see, for example, your candidate for the French Presidency saying that half of all immigrants should leave the country, stigmatising the Muslim community, threatening his European partners and jeopardising the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, I have to tell you that that language and behaviour are unacceptable today, too. As I said this morning, I wonder who really is the far right candidate: him or Ms Le Pen?</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, what we must not do, and what we have not done with the resolution, is hide things here. When things happen in the Netherlands, we must denounce them. When things happen in France, we must denounce them. When things happen in Hungary, we must denounce them, too, together!</p>

<p class="contents">This website stigmatises and stereotypes workers from Central and Eastern Europe and panders to discrimination against them. The outcry there has been over this website has not been without reason. The Dutch Government’s policy choices have been gradually filling a chalice with bad blood: the exclusion of Romanian and Bulgarian workers, the blocking of Schengen, the restriction of the social rights of EU citizens. And this website is the last drop that has made the chalice run over.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is not about the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), nor is it about Geert Wilders, though he would very much like that to be the case. His despicable initiative is an attempt to provoke and nothing more than that. This debate is about the position of Prime Minister Rutte, a prime minister who is neglecting his responsibilities. It is his responsibility to condemn this website in the strongest terms, because it is stigmatising EU citizens, and he is neglecting to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is Mr Rutte’s responsibility to protect the citizens of his country from discrimination and to address the causes thereof and he is neglecting that responsibility. It is Mr Rutte’s responsibility to accord paramount importance to the fundamental European right of free movement and he is neglecting to do that. Prime Minister Rutte has forced himself into a corner by repeatedly stating that he has no intention of condemning the website. And he seems to think that it would be a defeat to retrace his steps while he still has time.</p>
<p class="contents">On Thursday, we will be adopting a resolution here, by an overwhelming majority, in which we make it clear that Prime Minister Rutte’s failure to condemn the website will be an even greater defeat, for him, for the Netherlands’ reputation and, actually, for all Europeans. If Mr Rutte wants to be a prime minister who does business with the big boys and big girls of Europe, then he needs to be seen to address the consequences of this website and his government’s policies, like a real man. If he fails to do so, then his name will look totally in place on that illustrious list that is in the making: Berlusconi, Orbán, Rutte.</p>

This means that the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) consists of <span class="italic">one</span> man, Geert Wilders. Wilders <span class="italic">is</span> the PVV. In French and English-speaking regions, they immediately and very transparently saw through this. It is, therefore, true what they say: P, double V equals PW equals the Wilders Party.</p>
<p class="contents">The great leader Wilders saw the light one day and uttered these impressive words: things are not going well in the Netherlands, they have to change! Putting his money where his mouth was, he became the only member of the new party ‘P double V’, the Wilders Party. <span class="italic">Le parti, c’est moi!</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Wilders Party has only <span class="italic">one</span> member and it also has only <span class="italic">one</span> policy: things have to change. Therefore, roughly every three months, Mr Wilders starts taking direct pot shots at some random target: the Moroccans, the Turks, the Greeks, Queen Beatrix, ritual slaughter, the euro. Hmm, who has not had a thrashing yet from the great leader Wilders? Today, it is the Poles and Eastern Europeans. Tomorrow, it will be you or me!</p>
<p class="contents">That is what this whole thing amounts to, Madam President – nothing more and nothing less. The great leader Wilders thinks that things have to change and, time and again, he throws a tantrum to vent his frustrations. I believe we are showing too much respect to the P double V party by devoting a debate to it in this House. Certainly, when we recall that a debate here costs tens of thousands of euro per hour, we could have put that money to better use. I quote, with consent, the P double V donor Mr Hartong: ‘This is a joke’.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, today’s debate would not have been necessary if Prime Minister Rutte had immediately and unhesitatingly distanced himself from that website. He ought to have condemned the website straight away, because it encourages the intimidation and stigmatisation of a large group of people. Such a condemnation was all the more necessary because Mr Rutte depends on the support of the Wilders Party as a reluctantly tolerated junior partner in his government. In addition, the Prime Minister ought to have, in the same breath, praised the daily contributions of many Poles and Eastern Europeans to the Dutch economy. And I say that on behalf of my group in general but, in particular, on behalf of the Polish, Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian and Hungarian members of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">If Prime Minister Rutte had immediately expressed that condemnation, then we would have been able to have made more constructive use of our precious time here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Do you have problems with Eastern European immigrants? Have you lost your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian or other Eastern European? We want to know. That is what you can read on the site. That leaves us speechless; it is incitement to racial hatred. It also seems that the website is receiving more than 10 000 complaints per day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the work of a far-right party – which would be serious enough in itself – but, as has already been said, it is, in fact, a member of the parliamentary coalition that supports the current Dutch Government, which is refusing to condemn it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency and the Commission have just condemned this initiative, but you continue to refer the matter back to the Member States and their courts. I thought that the Commission was the Guardian of the Treaties, and that free movement and non-discrimination were European Union values. It seems that some values are more important than others, and when it comes to economic matters, when it comes to the free movement of goods or capital or barriers to competition, the Commission is much quicker to condemn. How do you expect the citizens not to wonder about the European Union’s real values?</p>
<p class="contents">There is worse, however. Similar practices are developing in many Member States. In Poland, two far-right sites cite a jumbled list of left-wing activists, homosexuals and foreigners as enemies of the race. In Latvia, Russians are targeted because of their registration plates. In both Poland and Latvia, very personal information is circulated about the people concerned. In Luxembourg, a law restricting foreign residents’ access to family allowances has just been adopted. We have already talked about Hungary and Mr Verhofstadt spoke about France. Indeed, our campaigning President of the Republic, after attacking the Roma, wants to hold referenda on immigration and is undermining the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is intolerable. It brings back sad memories, and not just in Eastern Europe. We cannot content ourselves with fine rhetoric; we must take action. It is high time that we did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty on European Union was signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992. One of its key provisions talked about creating an area without internal frontiers. Freedom to travel and freedom to choose the country where you want to live and work were some of the cornerstones of the success of the European Union. It is all the more regrettable that it is precisely in the Netherlands that a draconian violation of the European Union’s fundamental principles has occurred. This violation is the portal of Geert Wilders’s PVV party, on which it is possible to post complaints against the behaviour of immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, with no fear of retribution. I want to state clearly that I have no objection to stigmatising the behaviour of thieves, hooligans, vandals or thugs, but because they are thieves, hooligans, vandals or thugs, and not because they are Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians or representatives of any other nation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make it clear that this portal awakens evil demons. It brings to mind the familiar tragedies of the 20th century with concepts of ethnic exclusion and second-class citizens. I come from a country where the Germans once murdered 6 million people and, in some places, there were signs saying <span class="italic">nur für Deutsche</span> – German citizens only. Are we about to see signs in the Netherlands saying ‘Dutch citizens only’? I am asking because the lack of a definite response from the Dutch Government on this matter is an absolute scandal. I understand that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands is hostage to the Freedom Party, but the fundamental values of the European Union must not be sacrificed on the altar of any political interest. This portal breaches three directives: the Anti-Discrimination Directive, the directive on freedom of movement, and the directive on personal data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I demand a strong reaction from the European Parliament and, as a Pole and as an MEP from Poland – a country which shed blood for the liberation of the Netherlands at Arnhem under Generals Maczek and Sosabowski – I urge the European Parliament to condemn unequivocally this outrageous portal and to put pressure on the government of the Netherlands to force it to close this portal.</p>

Everyone knew then only too well that those countries were not ready to join. The ambition was to create not a stable EU, but, first and foremost, a large EU. The accession requirements were simply relaxed.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequence of that is that already, three hundred thousand people from Central and Eastern Europe have moved to the Netherlands. The reality is that the sheer numbers of these people are causing major problems in terms of housing, employment, education and social security. Unfortunately, this has also been accompanied by a large increase in crime and a massive burden on our society.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Madam President, this is the reality, one we have found out about through the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV)’s website, which has already received more than a hundred thousand complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels elite is partly responsible for the relocation of crime to the Netherlands, and the overburdening of services that this entails, because of its open-borders policy. The free movement of persons, yes, but this has also been accompanied by the free movement of crime and the concomitant social burden. The Dutch are bothered by it and have had enough. And they are not alone. France is having the same problems and now even the French President, Sarkozy, is threatening to suspend French membership of the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, Madam President, we are having a plenary debate here, but not about the problems, as our citizens would expect. No, we are having a debate about PVV’s website which is trying to map those problems. This is a world turned upside down. This Parliament is sweeping the problems under the carpet, this Parliament – including its President – does not want to know the facts. We are listening to our citizens. It is you, not we, who are walking away from the problems!</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels elite in the Commission and Parliament sees only the European dream, when, in reality, it appears to be turning into a nightmare, like a bubble bursting, but they do not actually want to know anything about this. They are like squabbling children who are throwing a tantrum now that there are no more presents to open. They can now shed their mask of moral superiority because our citizens have seen through it. Madam President, it is time that this Parliament was abolished.</p>

I want to make it clear that the Commission cannot replace the assessment of the relevant criminal judge at national level. Second, their national laws on hate speech on the Internet. Third, there are national laws implementing the 1995 Data Protection Directive. Here, it is the Dutch data protection authority which is responsible for taking action in order to analyse the initiative, to investigate whether an unlawful processing of personal data is taking place and to take the necessary steps to correct this.</p>

I would like to reiterate that the Council has not had an opportunity to discuss the question of the Member States’ handling of Internet sites.

That is an absolutely fundamental principle. It is a basic building block of the EU. It is an element of our shared values and history.

This website breaches the European principle of freedom. Under Articles 15 and 45 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, citizens have a right to freedom of movement, to engage in work and to study. The portal breaches the principle of a dialogue. It is one-sided and subjective in its assessment. It is aimed directly at a specific group of people and incites hatred.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that citizens of Central and Eastern Europe working in the Netherlands also participate in building the Dutch economy. As a Pole and a citizen of Europe, who knows its history, I would point out that many Polish soldiers died for the freedom of the Netherlands during World War Two. The soldiers under General Stanisław Maczek of the First Armoured Division deserve to be mentioned, who, after heavy fighting, liberated many Dutch towns, such as Breda, without civilian casualties. At that time, the residents did not spare their words of appreciation and gestures of gratitude to the Poles for the considered tactics which avoided the destruction of their homes and monuments. In the windows of Dutch homes, there were signs in Polish reading ‘Thank you, Poles’. We are building a Europe in which all citizens should be treated equally, and I appeal for this pursuant to Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am indeed surprised by the muted response of the Dutch Government to this initiative which tramples on the European Union’s values by inciting intolerance and discrimination. Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are fully-fledged EU Member States, and their citizens must be treated as such and not as some second-class citizens. The free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom enshrined in the Treaty which the Netherlands has signed. This is therefore a freedom which the Netherlands must respect and facilitate at all times, not only when Dutch companies have access to the markets of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

Both the silence from the Dutch authorities and the Commission’s lack of action are unacceptable and encourage the PVV to pursue its policy of xenophobia. It would therefore not surprise us if the next initiative from the PVV was to make it compulsory for foreigners to wear distinctive badges or simply to expel them from the Netherlands.

From birth, the Dutch are a very tolerant people; something like this would have been inconceivable back then. Today, this is all due to a wave of right-wing radicalism’. This was in response to the news story that the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, launched a website encouraging people to file complaints against Central and Eastern Europeans taking employment in the Netherlands. Four years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the right-wing government of the Netherlands distanced himself from the anti-Islamic film released by Wilders’s party. Back then, the government was not yet dependant on the support of a radical, extremist party. The current right-wing minority cabinet, however, is unwilling to condemn the creation of this website. This is because its survival depends on the support it receives from Geert Wilders and his associates. The Dutch Government is perfectly aware that the 200 000 Central Europeans who have been legally employed in the Netherlands since May 2007 are not adding to existing problems but, on the contrary, contribute to the welfare of the country’s citizens. The data of Dutch economic researchers show that a Polish or Hungarian worker taking long-term employment in the Netherlands contributes an annual EUR 24 000 to treasury income. We expect the Dutch Government to not only condemn all xenophobic, hatemongering actions on the part of the Party for Freedom, as well as all forms of discrimination, but also to provide factually accurate information to the populace about how foreigners, including immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, contribute to the prosperity of their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While, for partisan reasons, European liberals launch attacks against popular governments with reference to fundamental rights, the liberal Dutch Prime Minister openly collaborates with the radical Party for Freedom responsible for the website. We are deeply outraged that the website of the Party for Freedom incites the Dutch populace to file complaints against citizens from Eastern Europe based on their origin. Such acts and their tacit toleration undermine trust between Member States in times when what is needed is, in fact, reinforced solidarity. One cannot hide behind the freedom of speech when the fundamental personal rights of other citizens are being trampled underfoot. We must not tolerate such mockery of human dignity or the questioning of equality irrespective of origin. We must not tolerate open slander against Eastern European citizens. The issue of the Dutch website is not about abstract legal principles but about a specific case of practical violation of fundamental rights. Yet, despite extensive calls from the international community, the liberal Prime Minister remains unwilling to distance himself from the website. Such behaviour is detrimental to EU integration and weakens faith in our common values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many statements being made in Europe which ought to be raising question marks. We are all aware of what the European Union’s values are.

The Commission and Member States must consider developing a code of conduct for combating online incitement of hatred, and modifying their legislation to effectively respond to the new challenges of information technology. First, those websites that are fundamentally discriminatory in nature or instigate crimes need to be shut down; the national and international procedural rules for doing this need to be properly established. Second, discriminatory content appearing in mainstream websites and, most typically, in social networks must also be rejected. Although these pages have so many visitors that supervising them is almost impossible, authorities need to reach agreements with content providers and server hosts to at least limit such activities. Third, it must be considered that certain websites might be discriminatory by negligence, such as official and administrative pages of public interest that are non-accessible for people with disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The solution that assisted in the investigations carried out by the police – whom I thank on behalf of the citizens who use the Internet for constructive purposes and not as a weapon to harm the most vulnerable – is called ‘protected anonymity’, meaning the ability of the provider of such services to record the real details of the user, who can surf the Internet while appearing anonymous to other users. When an offence is committed through such a connection, the user must then face their responsibilities. It is the same principle that connects vehicle owners with their registration plate. However, in contrast to our congested motorways, the Internet is the open road for free expression that, according to some opinions expressed in this House, nobody should dare to restrict, even when the matter in question is child grooming or paedophilia offences. The message we send out today is significant. I hope that Written Declaration 29, adopted on 23 June 2010, will soon receive the necessary means for its implementation, since I believe that the dignity of children is entitled to the same protection as online privacy and freedom of expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Wilders and his party argue that the large number of workers from new Member States will increase crime and cause a deterioration in the standard of living in the Netherlands. This ignores the fact that precisely this group often accepts jobs which need to be done, but which the Dutch are reluctant to do. Immigrants contribute significantly to the Dutch GDP. Urging citizens to write denunciations against workers from Central and Eastern Europe is a manifestation not only of repugnant discrimination, but also of political immaturity. If we want to build a common international order such as the EU, the introduction of divisions based on negative stereotypes within the Union shows either a lack of understanding of what the EU is and should be, or wilful conduct striving to destroy it. Regardless of the motives, which should be condemned, it is high time that Mr Wilders and other politicians who build support based on nationalist and xenophobic slogans understand that the EU’s continued stable existence requires that we speak with one voice on key issues such as tolerance and equal opportunities in employment. This is in the interests of countries such as both Poland and the Netherlands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
