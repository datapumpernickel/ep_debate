<p class="contents">Concerning the subject, I wish to thank Members of Parliament for accepting the urgency procedure, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their support and their efficiency in handling that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The tsunami disaster devastated the coastal areas of numerous Asian countries and, besides tourism, the fisheries and aquaculture sector of these countries was the most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council have already welcomed and encouraged the initiatives taken by the Commission, in particular the measures aimed at rebuilding the sector in the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is only a specific part of a whole package of rehabilitation and restructuring measures. It aims to create the legal framework to allow Community vessels receiving public aid for permanent cessation to be transferred to countries affected by the tsunami, rather than being scrapped or reassigned for non-profitable purposes other than fishing. The intention is to make fishing capacity available in order to allow for a quick return to the activities on which the livelihood of countless coastal communities is completely dependent.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken particular care to ensure that the local needs are carefully assessed. In this respect, the role of FAO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, is decisive for the implementation of the rebuilding efforts in the area. This is on the agenda for the next FAO meeting of fisheries ministers in Rome on 12 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Two main guiding principles have determined our approach in this proposal. Firstly, a strong commitment to ensure consistency with the general objectives of the common fisheries policy and promote sustainability of the fishing activities in the long term. To achieve those objectives, we have proposed technical assistance to make an immediate impact assessment and design of the rehabilitation and reconstruction requirements for the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, a monitoring system will be set up in order to avoid possible adverse effects on the local economy and to ensure that the vessels transferred meet the needs identified by FAO. In addition, we have also emphasised that the transfers must be in accordance with the third country’s requests and that they respect the local fishing traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Community must offer a mechanism making it possible to act swiftly, while establishing an effective monitoring and control system without imposing unnecessary administrative burdens. The present proposal respects these constraints. Indeed, the proposal will not require reprogramming in the Member States under the current structural regulation for the fisheries sector. It has the further advantage that there are no financial consequences for the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would underline the political importance of this proposal. Faced with an immense destruction of thousands of vessels, this proposal alone will certainly have only a limited impact. The expected availability of suitable vessels, taking into account the principles of adaptability and sustainability, will allow us to meet only a fraction of the needs with this short-term measure. Doubtless, this specific and focussed action will be followed by other actions in the humanitarian field to address the immense needs also of the fishing sector in the affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that the Council has already discussed this proposal at a technical level and Member States' reactions are overall very encouraging. I also welcome the amendments that were tabled by Parliament, which clearly has this issue very much at heart. The Commission can accept a number of them. Regarding the other amendments, I note that in many instances they are noteworthy in the sense that they go far beyond what this regulation may provide for and so, very regretfully, they cannot be taken on board as part of this regulation. Their spirit, however, is undeniably driven by a clear commitment to alleviate the suffering brought on by the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Parliament will give a positive opinion on this proposal to enable me to move this regulation forward in the Council next Monday, on 28 February. This will allow the Member States to make the necessary changes in their internal regulations so that, if the needs are indeed established by FAO, we will be able to act quickly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the amendments. The Commission can accept Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 2: the Commission is in agreement with the spirit of this amendment, but it is somewhat misplaced and inappropriate to have such a reference to education and training since this aspect is not within the scope with respect to third countries. However, I will be willing to make a declaration before adoption by Parliament later on, wherein the Commission will declare that appropriate training and educational measures towards fishermen in the countries hit by the tsunami should be encouraged and wherein the Commission will state its intention to provide an assessment of the needs, at the request of the third countries, through the expert facility which has been made available for the long-term rehabilitation of the fisheries sector in the affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 3, 18 and 19: again we agree with the spirit of these proposals, but the actions being proposed are provided for by the monitoring mechanism contemplated by the regulation. Providing for such detailed and specific amendments within the text of the regulation itself could, however, have the affect of making the regulation cumbersome and too difficult to implement. We are, therefore, of the view that there is no need for these specific amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 6: we have no problem with the substance and we are willing to look at this change with the Presidency and the Council and expect to be able to overcome legal and technical difficulties that may arise with introducing changes to a title at a late stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 7: there again we agree with the spirit, but we have difficulty in accepting the amendment because it goes beyond the scope of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11 and 21: again, we agree with the spirit, but we feel that this is not the place to address such wider issues relating to the humanitarian assistance programmes. What this regulation enables us to do is to take a very concrete and specific action within the fisheries sector and more specifically within the FIFG regulation. Other initiatives will follow, not only to meet the overall humanitarian needs but also for the fisheries sector, but unfortunately they cannot be addressed in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 10 and 12: the coming into force of these amendments to Regulation 2792/99 cannot be made dependent to specific requests being made by affected countries. I wish to point out that this regulation guarantees the participation of the third countries and I refer honourable Members to Article 1 of the current regulation, which amends Article 7 of the basic regulation, and which states that our actions are to be in accordance with the third countries' request.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15: we agree with the spirit of these amendments and we will take them up with the Presidency and the Council to see how best they can be reflected in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 16: the regulation already provides in a number of instances for the assurance that fishing activity will be carried out in a sustainable manner. We, therefore, feel that this amendment is already taken into account in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendment No 17, but we would like to limit the scope of the action to small-scale fishing vessels, as defined in Article 3 of Council Regulation 2371/2002 (the CFP reform regulation).</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 20: we feel that this point is sufficiently covered by the provision under which the vessels to be transferred should be for the benefit of the affected fishing communities, and so this amendment is not required.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 22: the Commission has difficulty accepting this amendment: whereas technically it may be sound, its scope clearly undermines the spirit with which the regulation is being adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trouble is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">20 000 vessels under 12 metres in size were destroyed by the tsunami in the affected countries. The Commission proposal is to send somewhere between 150 and 200 old, redundant vessels from the Mediterranean to help replace the 20 000 that were destroyed. It is, as the Commission has pointed out, no more than a symbolic gesture. It is nevertheless a very expensive symbolic gesture. The cost has been put at roughly EUR 9 million, with an additional EUR 400 000 to pay for transporting these vessels to the affected part of the Indian Ocean. Therefore we are talking about roughly EUR 47 000 per vessel with the costs to be met entirely by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reliably told from experts on the ground in the Indian Ocean that replacement vessels of exactly the size required can be built for EUR 2 000 each. For the same amount of money that we propose Member States should spend, we could build 3 500 fishing vessels. This would be a much more meaningful response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's response to the amendments tabled by the various groups this morning would nevertheless suggest that the entire focus remains on this regulation to transfer vessels. I would suggest that the Commission refocuses and looks more closely at sending the things we can provide quickly, such as skilled experts, fishermen, carpenters, engineers, blacksmiths, boat builders, and the money to get people over there, as quickly as possible, to start rebuilding the kind of vessels they need to help replace the ones destroyed, instead of this nonsense of sending redundant, old, decrepit boats from the Mediterranean as a symbolic gesture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Aid can come in many different guises, and one way in which emergency aid could be provided would be to transfer fishing boats that would in any case be taken out of commission in the European Union. These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements. In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails. In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments. Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the groundswell of solidarity provoked by the tsunami disaster on Boxing Day may have been even greater among the seafaring community, which is more aware than others of its consequences for populations most of whom lived from the sea’s resources.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in response to this, Parliament, in its 13 January resolution, asked for an examination of the possibility of sending to the communities affected anything that might be of assistance to them, including boats. That is why Commissioner Borg and his services went to see things for themselves and are now asking us to approve the regulation authorising these potential transfers. As Mr Stevenson has just said, this announcement has stirred the feelings of some of my fellow Members, who are alarmed at the idea that Europe was in this way going to salve its conscience by simply sending its old vessels to people who would have no use for them and who would thereby be deprived of the resources essential for getting their economies going again.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, that is not what the Commission intends, since it has sent the necessary experts to look at how to reconstruct the devastated countries in the medium and long term. Authorising the transfer of a few dozen vessels suitable for the needs of the local populations and therefore requested by their authorities is therefore a short-term measure, one for the next few months. As you know, these vessels will be less than 12m long and must be less than 20 years old.</p>
<p class="contents">Before approving the Commission’s draft, as I hope we will, Parliament wanted, by means of a number of amendments, to clarify the terms for this transfer which, in particular, will not be made until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has completed the study you mention, Commissioner. The FAO has the necessary expertise and authority and is responsible for coordinating aid from all over the world. The amendments also seek to introduce new recitals to make clear that this is obviously in addition to the funds granted for the reconstruction of the sector’s industries and infrastructures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a nice idea to export old fishing vessels, but it would not work. This is a clear case of the emperor’s new clothes. Everyone can see that the idea would not work, but no one dares to say so publicly and to scrap the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The FAO has not received any request for boats. On the contrary, both Indonesia and Sri Lanka have declined such offers. In addition, a conference of regional fishing organisations met last week in Sumatra, with representatives from all the countries affected. They oppose the export of old vessels. They would rather have assistance in building up their local shipyards and fishing fleets. That is what we must help them with.</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, our amendments are aimed at reducing the risk of this export of boats destroying sea beds and the local economy and damaging fish stocks with the wrong kind of equipment. I hope that the Commission acts on its good intentions, but its voting recommendations could have been more generous.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there anyone from the Council – yes, the Council – in this House? Can you see that the emperor has no clothes and scrap this proposal?

On further consideration, however, all of the difficulties come to mind and, on still further reflection, the question arises as to whether the proposal would create more problems than it would solve and, ultimately, of whether the costs might not outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: what would be obtained in return for the money? If an amount similar to the total cost were spent on manufacturing boats locally, the benefit to local fisheries would be many times greater. It would also have the effect of supporting the local economy and the local shipbuilding industry, which need support in this emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the practicalities. Is it really so practical to collect these boats and transport them to the region? How should we handle distribution and allocation?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the matter of ecology. Completely different kinds of fishing are involved, different kinds of equipment are used and different catches are fished for. Sending a completely different kind of boat from those traditionally used in the area would be in danger of making fishing less sustainable and less environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: do the countries intended as recipients of these boats really want them? The answer to this question is, of course, the one we have received from the UN body FAO, which coordinates such matters: ‘no, they do not’. No request for these boats has been received; instead, the countries concerned want to be able to build their own boats, using their local traditions and their local techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">Having considered and twice re-considered this proposal, it becomes quite clear that it was a good idea but one that, on closer reflection, should be abandoned. It could undoubtedly be improved by adopting the amendments, especially those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. This would make it a better proposal. Most sensible of all, however, would no doubt be for the Commission to understand the situation, withdraw the proposal and instead try to persuade the Member States to provide at least equivalent sums for increasing the number of boats locally in the countries hit by the disaster. That would bring greater benefit to those we all wish to help, that is to say the victims of the terrible tsunami disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, millions lost close relatives or their livelihoods. The historically unparalleled demonstration of solidarity and generosity with which the rest of the world responded constituted a ray of hope in the middle of this tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing industry was hit particularly hard by the tsunami. In many cases, the survivors lost their boats, which are the tools upon which their livelihood depends. The proposal to help countries hit by the tsunami by giving them vessels from the EU is therefore morally commendable, but the measure would be a drop in the ocean, making the proposal almost absurd. A far better alternative would be to buy boats, suited to local purposes and needs, in the countries affected and in other neighbouring countries. This would also give the local economies a very badly needed boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it obvious what constitutes the EU’s role as an international player in such contexts. There is a tendency for forces within the EU to use disasters to advance their own positions. New EU authorities, programmes and measures are proposed, and anyone questioning this development appears disloyal at this particular moment in history. Often, the truth is, however, that, in such situations, the EU Member States should coordinate financial and material resources through other international bodies, principally within the framework of cooperation with the UN. One example of this would be the urgent development of an early warning system, of the kind already in place in the Pacific, for tsunami disasters in the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p class="contents">I object to the use of international tragedies for the purpose of giving the EU new powers. The EU’s powers must be discussed under normal conditions and in the context of the principle of subsidiarity, and not determined by quick decisions in disaster situations. The European peoples’ support for global solidarity should not be abused with a view to undermining the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we also believe that it is important to do things quickly, but to do them well. In this regard, we can only applaud the fact that humanitarian aid is being directed towards the fishing sector in question, but we believe that opting exclusively for the transfer of vessels is not the most appropriate approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner says that she agrees with the spirit of many of the amendments; we would have liked the Commission to have presented a full package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by this sector and we believe that the method presented is not appropriate, since it has been rejected by the NGOs working in the area, which have received this proposal with great reservations. The FAO itself has stated that our good intentions may aggravate the problem rather than resolve it and, as far as I know, two countries have said that they do not want ships to be sent, and some of them have extreme restrictions such as, for example, the prohibition of fishing by vessels of more than 10 horsepower.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not sufficient simply to ensure that we do not send large vessels, as the proposal states, but rather we must send appropriate vessels to the area, which are designed to anchor at shallow beaches and are made with materials which are resistant, amongst other things, to high tropical temperatures and humidity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further problem, that of funding, and we had been promised it would be resolved. In this case, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, there is no extra funding, which means that this burden is going to affect countries at the expense of an FIFG which has already been promised to them, and I very much doubt that this proposal can be at all effective.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we would ask that the amendments which have been presented by the majority of these groups, which we have all signed and which we are going to support, and which propose other alternatives and furthermore propose accepting the European Commission’s proposal, be seen as a political message from this Parliament to the European Commission and the Council, and I hope it will become effective over the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two months must have been the most terrible eternity for the many thousands of human beings who have lost not only their families, their homes and their communities, but have also been deprived – and unfortunately remain deprived – of their only means of subsistence, especially those whose livelihood was fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal tabled by the Commission is therefore a welcome one and should be adopted by Parliament once the proposals for improvement, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and other parliamentary groups, have been incorporated. The proposal must, however, be assessed realistically and in terms of its actual scale. In other words, it should be viewed as a limited, short-term solution that is little more than symbolic, bearing in mind that thousands of boats were destroyed and it is unlikely that this action will help to replace more than a few dozen vessels. In addition, doubt has also been raised as to the suitability of the vessels for their intended purpose, and the logistics of the proposal are becoming complex and costly, especially when it comes to transporting the vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative does have the merit, however, of demonstrating that the EU has not turned a blind eye to this aspect of the tragedy. Yet solidarity will only be effective if we go further, that is, if adequate funding is granted for building and rebuilding vessels <span class="italic">in situ</span>, especially small boats and traditional tools that are appropriate for local fishing methods. The funding in question can be secured by removing part of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance from the appropriations allocated to each Member State. To sum up, the Commission’s proposal should not be subject to demagogical criticism simply because it falls short of what is needed. Our primary objective is to do everything we can to bring it up to speed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one begrudges help to the people affected by the tsunami. Parliament, in its resolution on the tragedy, made special mention of those engaged in fishing, calling on the Commission to examine ways in which tangible aid in the form of vessels, gear, technical expertise and raw materials can be directed towards the affected communities. But there have been too many examples in the past of well-intentioned aid being left to rot because it was not suited to local conditions, or because there was not the wherewithal or the expertise to make use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">If decommissioned vessels are to be exported, this must be under stringent conditions as to suitability, processed in accordance with the full assessment of needs, only upon request by the country concerned and accompanied by appropriate assistance. Because of concerns about distortions of local economies and the depletion of fish stocks, we also seek some further reassurances. First, about where the ownership of vessels will rest and second that this is purely an emergency measure and will not open the back door to a wider export scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Given such reassurance, and on the understanding that both the Commission and the Council will take our reservations seriously, it is possible to support the proposal. The Commissioner has made some commitment in this regard, but I am disappointed by the reluctance to incorporate much by way of amendment into the regulation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission and the Council to take a much more comprehensive approach to rebuilding fishing communities. The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Rescue Institute in Stonehaven, Scotland, is just one example, and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament's earlier call. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that does not mean that these vessels are suitable for use in any area. The more I have looked into the actual situation in the tsunami-hit countries, the more sceptical I have become about the value of this particular proposal. It may be a symbolic gesture and it may be that a small number of vessels could be used or converted, but I do not think that will be of major assistance to areas that were devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the amendments tabled by the various groups. I very much regret that the Commission has not agreed to support them. If this proposal is adopted in some way by the Council, I believe that the amendments would bring about very considerable improvements, not only to in a practical sense, but to its intention and spirit. A measure such as this should be looked at as an enabling measure; not to enable Member States to actively offload unsuitable vessels to the these countries, but to enable those countries that have been affected to request certain vessels to be transferred to their areas if they are suitable for use or conversion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are incapable of either predicting or preventing such disasters, and they act as a reminder of how insignificant we are in the face of nature. They also remind us that animals are sometimes better at sensing danger and preparing to face it than we are. This should act as a warning to us all against feeling too clever, too overconfident and too sure of our own omnipotence. There is a force more powerful than we are, and from time to time it humbles us and reminds us of our insignificance.</p>
<p class="contents">The rest of the world responded to the tsunami disaster by making extremely generous donations, whether on an individual, governmental or institutional basis. The question that must be asked, however, is whether we will succeed in putting these donations to appropriate use, and whether we will succeed in getting them to where they are most needed. Immediately after the disaster, there was a lack of everything, including water, food, tents and blankets. The world already has a certain amount of experience in the rapid provision of such items, and aid reached the victims quickly. The provision of long-term aid is a different story, though, and another opportunity for us to be reminded of our own small-mindedness. Jackals tend to appear wherever money is involved, with the sole aim of snatching something for themselves. This gives rise to a number of problems, such as the way in which the money should be shared out, what should be rebuilt first, which institutions or parties should be used to transfer the money and who can be trusted.</p>
<p class="contents">The tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy. The tourist industry was hit hardest, including the sex tourism industry, for which many of the regions devastated were renowned, but the fishing industry was also hit. The question is whether, and to what extent, money that people have been generous enough to donate should be used to rebuild the sex tourism industry, with its escort agencies, massage parlours and brothels. We must also ask ourselves whether we will succeed in reassuring those who have donated money that their money will not be used for such purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating a proposal to transfer fishing boats to fishermen whose livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami. This is the best possible form of assistance that could be provided. In the European Union we pay fishermen to scrap their boats. Surely, if the boats are still seaworthy we should instead give them to fishermen in the areas hit by the tsunami disaster who have lost their own boats? Provided the costs of transferring fittings for these boats and other related costs are not too high, aid should be targeted at such measures. We can be confident that donors will be happy with such an arrangement. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal deserves our support, but it is only a drop in an ocean of needs. We should do more, by allowing aid to be used to build fishing boats that meet the specific needs of the tsunami victims. We would then be confronted with the familiar problem of who should benefit from these orders and from being paid to build the boats. The countries hit by the tsunami should be the ones to benefit wherever possible, with donor countries taking second place. At the same time, those who build the boats must agree to forsake their profit, and to earn only a minimal amount of money. We should also rebuild other branches of the coastal industry destroyed by the tsunami, such as the shellfish farming industry, but we should take care to ensure that aid is not granted to the tourist industry, in particular the part of it that preys on human weakness. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only right that the European Union should show solidarity when major natural disasters occur.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my concern here about measures of this kind. There is a real risk that the vessels sent to the Asian countries will be suited neither to those countries’ fishing habits nor to their environment. Worse, they could be a source of pollution. Let us not add to the tragedy of the tidal wave that of seeing unsuitable vessels abandoned to pollute those countries’ coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">My other concern is about the cost of transport. The European Commission estimates that transferring fishing vessels from the European Union to the countries affected by the tsunami will cost around EUR 50 000 per vessel. In that case, would it not be better to give that money directly to the countries concerned, which could then build far more boats that are in keeping with their traditions, especially since the NGOs that are in contact with the fishermen have told us they can build a vessel for around EUR 1 200?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that two essential conditions must be satisfied for Europe’s action. The request for the transfer of shipping vessels must come from the Asian countries themselves; it would in fact already appear that neither Indonesia nor Sri Lanka wish to receive any. Moreover, the FAO has not received any requests for this kind of transfer. I am also convinced that the transfer of the vessels must only be one part of our efforts. Community humanitarian aid funds must also be mobilised for the reconstruction of the fishing sector. Aid could for example take the form of sending experts and fishermen to help with the rebuilding of the local fishing infrastructures. The FAO report we are expecting at the beginning of March will be crucial in determining the strategy to be followed by the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will be some time before the full extent of the loss and damage suffered by the fishing industry is known. But severe losses and/or damage to fishing vessels of all types have been reported from countries affected by the tsunami disaster, in particular Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India.</p>
<p class="contents">Sri Lanka, for instance, has lost nearly 70% of its entire fishing fleet, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Most of the fishing in the area is carried out by thousands of small boats of around 4.8 m in length. As well as the loss of fishermen's lives and boats and gear, harbours, production plants and freezing plants all suffered extensive damage. Normal fishing activity cannot resume without intervention and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, we want to help. The urgency before us today relates to transferring vessels from EU Member States to countries hit by the tsunami. The proposal has been strongly criticised, as we hear this morning, as being inappropriate because the climate and fishing practices of EU countries vary from those of south-east Asia. I can understand why concern has been expressed over how suitable EU boats may be for fishing in south-east Asia. However, I welcome the proposal before us today on the basis that it allows for the transfer of boats that meet the restricted criteria and that might be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group by Mr Kindermann, both singly and jointly with other groups, in particular the amendments that ensure that adverse effects on fisheries resources and the local economy are avoided, that the transfer is accompanied by any appropriate training, that boats are suitable and that the transfer meets the requirements of the FAO's needs assessments and is requested by the third country. On that basis, I am happy to support the urgency and I call on colleagues to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This week, the FAO has written to this House to say that, firstly, we were mentioned seven times in the Commission’s proposal, about which it itself was not consulted even once. Secondly, it informs us that no governments are currently asking for European boats, and, thirdly, that the vessels and the industrial fish sector on the Atlantic coast are in every respect different from the traditional canoes and catamarans of Sri Lanka and India. A fourth point is that local boatyards must do the repair work, for that is what they are good at, and that provides the people there with money, work and the wherewithal to earn a living. Our money would buy something like 2500 boats in place of the 200 referred to here. Fifthly, we must prevent our vessels from further interfering in the already gravely ravaged fishing grounds and local fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The only conclusion to be drawn from this is: help the local fishermen in the boatyards, but do not send ships, or else, no matter how good our intentions, we will be inflicting another tsunami on the coasts of Asia. I am disappointed that the Commission is willing to accept only 3 of this House’s 22 amendments, which, let me add, I was happy to support. All this, along with the FAO letter and the reports from the NGOs on the ground, leads me to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, while the Commission is trying to find innovative solutions to an unprecedented disaster, I would urge it to remain pragmatic about the impact of this gesture. This proposal is well-intentioned. I appreciate we all want to do all we can to help the hundreds and thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods because of the tsunami but it is important that this is additional help and not replacement help or help in kind and that this does not count towards the EUR 350 million that the EU has already committed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the best use for the larger decommissioned boats. The fishing communities in India and Thailand were equally devastated and I believe that the more developed fishing industry in these countries may be better placed and better equipped, to use the larger vessels, so this idea should be explored. Obviously, these boats will not be of any use to the individual, local fishermen, but they could be used by cooperatives or SME businesses. It is important that all the countries are treated equally and that we explore the right avenue for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the ways in which non-financial assistance will be granted is the transfer of second-hand boats to fishermen who were affected by the tsunami, and who lost not only their families and their closest friends, but also their homes and the means of earning their living. When the House held a vote on this resolution on Tuesday morning, no one was in any doubt as to whether to vote in favour. This was a natural expression of emotion and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of questions that must be asked, however. Will the Commission pay out compensation to all of those to whom it has been guaranteed? To what extent will this make extra demands upon the European Union’s budget, and why does the Commission wish to transfer some of the cost to the Member States? Will European fishermen who have decided to give up their jobs receive the compensation promised by the EU? Will there be any chance of compensation for companies and steelworks that had already been awarded contracts to demolish boats and had incurred organisational costs, and will jobs created under the previous programme be safeguarded? Should the Commission consider providing assistance for building new ports and shipyards in countries affected by the tsunami, instead of restricting itself to the transfer of old fishing boats?

I shall attempt to address all the questions that have been asked, but I should like to start my answer with a phrase that Mr Kindermann used; ‘a political sign of solidarity’. Our aim is to send out precisely such a sign by means of this project, which is merely a small part of a much larger aid measure, and one way in which we can provide aid rapidly and to those who need it. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span>With your permission, I am now going to give a more specific answer to a few particular questions. First, the question of the calculation. I have heard talk of EUR 47 000, 50 000 per vessel. As has already been explained to the Committee on Fisheries, these figures are not correct. The vessels’ owners are paid a scrapping premium for them in any case. The only thing that changes is that the vessels are not scrapped but transferred, and the transport cost is no more than EUR 4 000 per vessel. That is therefore the cost to be taken into account and not the fanciful figures that have been mentioned. Incidentally, they are not small boats. Small boats like dinghies can of course be rebuilt on the spot. What we are talking about here, however, are medium-sized vessels of not more than 12 metres, and the necessary capacity for building such vessels does not exist on the spot.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question was about the age of the vessels. The average age of European vessels in service is 25 years; that of the vessels that will be exported to the countries affected by the tsunami will be between 5 and 20 years. We are not therefore talking about very old boats.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of experts, I would like to say that experts have already been sent out and more will be sent. Moreover, it is at our request that the FAO is making an assessment of needs and this point will be on the agenda for the 12 March ministerial meeting, at which Mr Borg will represent the Commission. We are all in favour of close cooperation with the FAO; we will see to it that our experts are able to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the establishment of the early warning system is concerned, together with experts from international bodies, the Commission is in the process of setting up early warning systems by transferring our technologies to the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say very clearly that the condition of the vessels and their suitability for the needs will be examined by experts. The needs will be assessed by the FAO. We want to be ready if requests come in. We have already had a request for vessels from Thailand. Finally, Mr President, I believe this is a moral question. Can we continue to scrap vessels here if they can be of use to fishermen on the other side of the world?</p>
