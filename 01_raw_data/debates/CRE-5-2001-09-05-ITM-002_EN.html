<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Gerhard (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago the European Parliament set up a special committee to ascertain whether there was in fact a global interception system for which the US National Security Agency was ultimately responsible and which was able to intercept any communication by telephone, fax or e-mail in Europe. This system is allegedly operated by a group of states which includes one of the Member States of the European Union, namely the United Kingdom. Now that the Cold War is over, the main function of the system appears to be industrial espionage. The system, it is alleged, bears the code name <span class="italic">Echelon</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, was a difficult investigative mission, because the European Parliament has no access at all under any circumstances to the files of the intelligence services of the EU Member States, let alone access to details of the activities of American agencies. However, after a year of painstaking investigation, we are able to communicate the following to the House without any lingering shadow of doubt: first of all, there is no intelligence system operated by the secret services of any one state by means of which any communication in Europe can be intercepted. This allegation must be consigned to the domain of creative journalism! The assertion is not made any more credible by the fact that it is repeated, and regrettably so, in a study commissioned by the European Parliament, a fact that lends it a certain cachet of respectability.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are looking at here is not what we were expected to find. Telecommunications obey the laws of physics, and without access to the media of communication it is impossible to intercept the messages they carry. The secret services do not possess magic powers with which they can alter the laws of physics! The second point we are able to make, however, is that there is indeed an interception system, and these are its characteristics: it operates globally and is run by an intelligence alliance comprising the parties to the UKUSA Agreement, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. There is nothing coincidental about this combination of states, which has its roots in the Second World War. By and large, it only has access to intercontinental communications which are transmitted with the aid of communications satellites or undersea cables serving the UKUSA countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Communications within Europe, therefore, are scarcely affected, but communications with African, Arabic and Latin American countries most certainly are. We do not know exactly how much local radio communication can be intercepted by embassies, but it is evident that this does not represent the bulk of intelligence operations. By way of contrast to police surveillance operations, which always target an individual or a clearly defined group of people, the system concerning us here intercepts every communication to which it has access and feeds it into a computer search engine. On the basis of a catalogue of search terms, the search engine selects those communications that are likely to be of interest to the intelligence services. In other words, the system works like a vacuum cleaner and the intelligence services operate the filter. In technical terms this is known as strategic communications monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The search engine can identify telephone numbers, the voices of prime targets and the content of e-mails and typed faxes. Given the present state of the art, these search engines will not be able to interpret handwritten faxes and spoken messages in the foreseeable future, which means that these forms of communication cannot be automatically processed by the intelligence services. In addition, we have evidence that the system does indeed have the code name <span class="italic">Echelon</span>. Its name, however, is irrelevant. It might just as well be called Rumpelstiltskin; the important thing for us is what it does.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the findings, and let me add that we are not simply hypothesising. We can back up these statements with a strong chain of evidence that could stand up in a court of law. Those who wish to know precise details will have to read the report for themselves. Suffice to say that, if we had made any false allegations in this report, you can safely assume that the intelligence services of the countries in question would have been only too delighted to take us apart in public! This they did not do, which speaks volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we assess these findings? One of our assessment criteria must be to ask what our own services actually do. That is not the sole criterion, but it must be taken into consideration if we intend to hold an honest debate on this subject. Most of the intelligence services in the EU Member States engage in strategic communications monitoring. </p>
<p class="contents">Only Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal do not use such technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it goes without saying that the purpose for which strategic monitoring is used will also affect our assessment. If it is targeted at internationally organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, the arms trade, terrorism, proliferation or sanctions busting, or if it is used to protect national security, there can be no questioning the legitimacy of its purpose as such. But if it is being used to spy on foreign companies in order to tip the competitive balance in favour of domestic industries, that is quite a different matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the end does not justify the means. In short, the end is not everything, for each individual case of eavesdropping is an invasion of privacy. It is not a problem of quantity either. Human rights are individual rights; they are not a matter of statistics. Such an invasion of privacy is only permissible on certain conditions. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights is crystal clear in this respect. Briefly, the conditions are as follows: there must be a legal basis for such an operation – it cannot be arbitrary; a value judgment must be made, the breach of privacy being weighed against the morality of its purpose; the operation must be foreseeable, which means that the general public must know that such a system exists, and recourse to interception must only be permitted if there is no alternative. It is, in other words, an <span class="italic">ultima ratio.</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are Members of this House who agree that it is acceptable for the police to intercept communications in pursuance of a court order for the purpose of criminal prosecution. But in the case of the intelligence services, they call it an infringement of human rights. I fully understand anyone expressing political opposition to this type of action by the secret services. I can see the logic of that. It is not my position, but I can follow their reasoning. But anyone who says it is illegal is disregarding the rulings of our own European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial espionage is certainly not a legitimate reason for intercepting communications. All intelligence services do, of course, deal with economic issues too, examining developments in financial and commodity markets, for example. To that extent most of the services engage in espionage in the economic domain. But we are not criticising them for that. The problem arises when this espionage goes beyond the clarification of general security issues and the intelligence services pass on details to industrialists in their own country in order to give their companies a competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Such behaviour between EU Member States, furthermore, would be incompatible with Community law, because it constitutes a type of prohibited state aid. On the international stage it is more than just an unfriendly act, and between allies it is nothing short of a scandal. Incidentally, intercepting communications is not the preferred method of industrial espionage, which is generally conducted by conventional means. But there are individual cases in which the instrument of interception can be used to great effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, as you know, has come in for the heaviest criticism. The United States has always denied that intelligence is passed on directly to US companies. It has admitted, however, that it intercepts detailed communications concerning major contracts that are open to international tender. The argument used to justify these measures is that European companies would offer bribes and that there is a need for a defence against this.</p>
<p class="contents">This position, to put it very politely and diplomatically, must be scrutinised. First of all, we know that US corporations engage in bribery too. In the latest Bribe Payers Index published by Transparency International, the United States occupies a mid-table position among the world’s major exporting countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this type of thing is now prohibited within the OECD by a Convention, which the Member States of the European Union have transposed into national law. For the United States, despite this, to remain entrenched in the cowboy mentality which holds that might is right would be a denial of the principle that such problems can be solved by formal international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if it is true that the American intelligence agencies do not engage in detailed industrial espionage, why is there no law in the United States of America that proscribes such activity by intelligence agencies? Why ever not?</p>
<p class="contents">The real political problem, basically, is that, in the European public debate, the United States is considered capable of such measures. The political problem highlighted by this whole issue is the prevalence of profound mistrust. This mistrust has to be weeded out.</p>
<p class="contents">We have developed a host of proposals, some of which relate to the monitoring of the intelligence services here in Europe, to a code of conduct for the EU Member States and the like. Ultimately, however, it all boils down to one simple main problem: the protection of privacy is guaranteed by the national legal systems, but communications are becoming increasingly international. There is no world government to protect them. This is one of the many problems posed by globalisation. We must reach agreements and enshrine them in international law so that privacy is protected worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, a second problem remains, a problem to which I referred at the start of the report with the Latin tag <span class="italic">Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes</span>, meaning ‘But who will watch these watchmen?’ That is the perennial problem.</p>

I am delighted with Parliament’s thorough investigation into this matter. This initiative is in line with the traditional democratic supervisory role of legislative meetings. It reflects the concerns of many EU citizens with regard to that system.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I should like to draw attention to the fact that, during your activities in this connection, the Council presidency has, at all times, shown its willingness to cooperate loyally with Parliament. The Portuguese, French and Swedish Presidencies have all accepted Parliament’s invitation to clarify their position in this matter, both at plenary meetings and at meetings of your temporary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore in that capacity that I am here today attending the discussion of the report and of the resolution of the temporary committee and that I wish to express my sympathy with Parliament’s concern in this matter. As you will know, the word ‘sympathy’ in Greek – to refer to one of the old languages – means ‘empathy’.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the parliamentary bodies of my own country have also devoted attention to the interception of communications, as evidenced in two Belgian parliamentary reports which were sent to Mr Schmid and which are mentioned in his report, reinforces my belief that the political issue involved is complex, yet important.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you will nevertheless understand that I, as President of the Council, must limit my reaction to those aspects which are related to the Council or the Union’s institutions in general. It is not my role to react on behalf of or in respect of individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The basic principles that must govern all communications interception systems are well known. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – an article that the EU must respect under the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union – stipulates that everyone has a right to the respect for his privacy. Under the same Article, and also according to the Court of Justice’s established case law, there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and which is necessary to achieve precisely stated aims and where this respects the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Basing its work on these principles, the Justice and Home Affairs Council met on 29 and 30 May 2000 and reiterated the Council’s commitment, as regards the Echelon network, to the respect of fundamental rights and people’s freedoms. The Council also stressed that although a telecommunications interception system may be an important tool to combat crime and to defend national security, under no circumstances, however, should this system be used to gain commercial advantage. These principles were also included in the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000 between the Member States of the European Union. Article 20 of this Convention thus specifies the conditions in which telecommunications interception may be permitted within the framework of cooperation between Member States in criminal matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council is obviously willing to make full use of these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">You will see that Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Community institutions and bodies, is evidence that the Community institutions already share the determination to protect people against the abuse of their personal data. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> The right to respect for private and family life and data protection are closely related. Moreover, we know that thanks to continuous technological advancements, the efficient protection of personal data cannot remain restricted to the Union’s borders but must be extended worldwide. That is why the Union is trying to promote a dialogue with third countries, as well as a transatlantic dialogue with the United States and Canada. An initial meeting of experts on legal systems for data protection has already taken place last May in Brussels during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">During a Legal and Home Affairs meeting involving top American officials, which took place on 17 July of this year, both the presidency and the United States recognised the need for reaching an agreement in this area. A second meeting was to take place under the Belgian Presidency, this time at the invitation of the US, to lay the groundwork for future agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report by Mr Schmid drawn up on behalf of the Temporary ECHELON Committee, Parliament has more than met what is expected within the Union in terms of quality. Therefore, Parliament and the Schmid report are fundamental to greater awareness of this issue. The Council and the presidency, each within their own remit, will make every effort to guarantee fully respect for private and family life and data protection, both within the Union and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, electronic communication is only set to increase in future. Communications are, by definition, private in nature, and their confidentiality must be guaranteed. It would, therefore, be totally unacceptable, on grounds of principle, for communications to be tapped without a very legitimate reason indeed and without those tapping the communications being subjected to any kind of democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency sets great store by the security of networks and information. A policy which is predominantly based on Commission communication <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0298">COM (2001) 298</a> which, on the one hand, draws attention to the need to fight cyber crime and, on the other, indicates the need to protect data in the field of telecommunication.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s communication offers fresh food for thought, and the Belgian Presidency intends to continue on this path. Accordingly, we wish, first of all, to make progress in the development of an alarm and information system which aims to combat the risks inherent to the use of IT. More specifically, the presidency hopes that the Telecommunications Council of 15 October next will result in a clear, common objective. That should enable the Telecommunications Council of December to lay down a detailed action plan and timeframe in terms of <span class="italic">e</span>-security. Moreover, we intend to examine further the progress made by the Member States in the field of systems security within the framework of the implementation of the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe 2002 action plan. Different initiatives have been launched in the Member States in order to encourage citizens and businesses to make use of safe IT material. In addition, the sixth Framework Programme concerning research, which is currently being discussed in the Council, should also emphasise all aspects related to security of networks and information traffic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The revision of telecommunications legislation also contains some provisions updating European regulations, particularly on the protection of personal data and privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will soon issue an opinion, at first reading, on this important text. The text includes, amongst others, general provisions on the confidentiality of communications, and on the general principle of deleting traffic and location data relating to these communications.</p>
<p class="contents">The general principle is, of course, qualified by the option given to the authorities responsible for public safety and for combating crime to request access to the information on a case-by-case basis. As you know, the debate is still open on the length of time such information can be stored.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to return briefly to the issue of intelligence gathering. In the military capabilities commitment declaration, annexed to the Nice European Council conclusions, the Member States acknowledged that serious effort would be needed in the area of intelligence so that, in future, the European Union has more strategic intelligence at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament motion for a resolution highlights the need for democratic monitoring of intelligence operations that might be established within the European Union. This is a general principle, which we can only support. More specifically, the presidency currently believes that, should this type of intelligence capability be established within the EU, we would have to investigate the procedures that would need to be implemented in order to ensure democratic monitoring of these activities. These procedures would naturally have to take into account the particular nature of the intelligence field which, in order to function effectively, requires that information gathered remains confidential.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to sum up and in conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Watson once again for his excellent work and I hope that you have an interesting debate. I shall be staying in the House to listen to what you have to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various people come to you and report a bombing, carried out by five terrorists. At the scene of the crime indicated there are two possible victims, but they say nothing. The five suspects are also silent. The explosive device is not immediately apparent and no details of the incident are known. In short, it is a rather difficult case.</p>
<p class="contents">This is tantamount to what happened when journalists began to tell us that there was a global interception system called <span class="italic">Echelon </span>which was operated by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and which could intercept and analyse phone, fax and e-mail communications worldwide. Individuals, businesses and institutions, they said, were subjected to systematic surveillance. So what facts have we established after a year of investigation? As the detective sergeant, I would say that the five suspects were indeed at the scene of the crime, but the weapon was a precision rifle rather than a bomb. Each of the suspects was capable of firing the weapon, but all the evidence suggests that only one of them actually acted in a criminal manner. The victims have given us clues to help us in our investigations but are not prepared to testify in court, and so we unfortunately have insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. It will be essential, however, to keep the suspects under observation and to take further precautions.’</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that the five aforementioned states do indeed cooperate within this espionage system. Its name is irrelevant, but let us call it <span class="italic">Echelon</span> for the sake of convenience. The system, however, can only intercept civilian communications that are routed via Intelsat satellites. And these satellites only carry a small percentage of global telecommunications traffic and an even smaller percentage of private telephone calls. Moreover, these activities by intelligence services were tolerated by the international community on condition that they were essential to the protection of national security interests. There are now indications, however, that the United States is using some of these intercepted data for purposes other than the preservation of national security. The US agencies have admitted, for example, that they eavesdrop on European companies bidding for major foreign contracts, allegedly because these companies engage in bribery. The agencies’ intelligence reports are then forwarded to US embassies so that the ambassador to the awarding country can influence the host government by making it aware of the bribery allegations. The US Department of Commerce also has an Advocacy Center, which maintains, through the US embassies, a worldwide network devoted solely to helping US corporations land major contracts. There are clear grounds for suspecting the United States of illegal industrial espionage. Regrettably, the companies that have been victims of these activities remain silent for fear of tarnishing their image.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur and his team for resisting the attempts of the Greens, as well as those from the Left of this chamber, to have him write a cloak-and-dagger thriller. His report is responsible and objective, presents the conclusive and presumptive evidence, distinguishing clearly between the two, and does not prejudge the issue. Some may feel that his conclusions do not go far enough, but they do exhaust the available legal options. Protection against illegal acts committed by non-European intelligence services can only be achieved through global instruments. As far as our own area of responsibility is concerned, the main priority for us is to close the confidentiality gaps in the Commission. Unlike the Council or the Central Bank, the Commission persists with data protection and confidentiality mechanisms that belong to the Middle Ages. The dangers posed by non-European countries in this domain have obviously been entirely underestimated. We therefore call on the competent committee to initiate its own report on this issue. We also call on our British friends, since they are fellow members of the European Union, to establish effective and legitimate control of American espionage conducted against European targets from British territory; otherwise they are in breach of European data protection law.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank the rapporteur once again for his cooperation with us. I am sure that this report will carry the support of an overwhelming majority of the Members of this House.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the Temporary Committee on ECHELON and other large-scale tapping systems was launched over a year ago. There was then serious doubt as to whether this Committee would be able to complete its mandate that was issued by Parliament within the time period given. My colleague, Mr Gerhard Schmid, presented the report with the results of the work of this temporary committee a moment ago. On behalf of my group, I should like to express my great appreciation for the work that the rapporteur, but also the President of the Committee, Mr Coelho, have done over the past year. The report contains proof for the first time that ECHELON exists, a system based on the cooperation of five countries in the worldwide tapping and interception of international telephone and message traffic. In addition, it is indicated that other countries too, including most EU Member States, use systems for tapping international telecommunications traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the report, however, explodes the myth that, via ECHELON and similar systems, every phone call would be tapped and every fax message or e-mail read. It is technically impossible to do this, and most countries involved are democracies which impose clear restrictions on the activities of the secret services, at least with regard to their own citizens. Mainly based on information which was published in the course of the investigation of the ECHELON Committee by the Dutch and German governments, we know that systems for tapping international telecommunication are often used as an aid in the fight against international terrorism, trafficking in human beings, the drugs trade, the illegal arms trade, and to enforce internationally established embargoes. And nobody objects to that, at least, provided that this is done under sound democratic and political control whilst guaranteeing that the international and national rules protecting the privacy of citizens are upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">The unnecessary secrecy, the surreptitious behaviour of the secret services and the lack of openness of many governments prevent systems for tapping international telecommunications from being deployed in a more transparent manner. Clear and enforceable rules to protect the privacy of all European citizens in all EU countries must form an inherent part of the constitutional rights as laid down in the European Charter. With this, it must be ensured that the strict rules which currently apply in most countries for tapping a country’s own citizens will, in the near future, apply to all EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective democratic and political supervision of activities carried out by secret services, and hence tapping international telephone traffic, form an essential part of every state’s right to defend the security of its citizens or its democratic fabric against external attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">A change in mentality is required. It is inevitable that some aspects of the work of the intelligence service should remain confidential, but there is also a great deal that could most certainly be brought into the open in a democratic society. Only countries which, in respect of its citizens, deal with their intelligence services in an open and honest way will also be able to provide the necessary cooperation at European level and be able to help set up a European intelligence force in the framework of an effective common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With this, the traditional distrust which intelligence services harbour in respect of outsiders and the equally traditional priority given by countries to their own national interests must be turned into a kind of cooperation in which the treaty concluded between the UK and the US, underlying ECHELON, completely fades into the background. Not only because it was agreed during the European Summit in Helsinki that a European intelligence force will be created as part of a European intervention force, but especially because the fight against international terrorism and the trafficking in human beings, for example, is a joint European task.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to add one more observation in this connection. Further European cooperation in the gathering of intelligence, which is also significant to the EU in terms of its position within the confederate framework of NATO, will force the British government to make a fundamental choice: either it continues to favour transatlantic cooperation or it becomes fully involved in cooperation at European level. A bit of both would not only lack credibility, but is also practically impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">During the investigation by the ECHELON Committee, we have not obtained any evidence that citizens’ privacy is being intentionally violated or that systems designed for large-scale tapping operations involving international telecommunications traffic are deliberately being used for large-scale and direct industrial espionage. Furthermore, specific enquiries made to large European companies elicited no reaction. However, based on remarks made by America, it has transpired that intelligence received accidentally is, in a number of cases, most definitely used. If one casts the herring nets, but happens to catch a salmon, then that salmon is not always thrown back into the sea but sometimes ends up on the table. Whoever has confidential information at their disposal does well to protect that confidential information. In this respect, the European Union and Member States are required to cooperate by giving advice, by developing user-friendly cryptographic hardware and software and especially by raising public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the report by the ECHELON Committee in particular has made a major contribution to the aforesaid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports reaches the conclusion that a global communications interception system exists within the framework of the UKUSA Agreement, that this system is definitely known as Echelon, that it is used to intercept private business, and not military, communications, that the system’s technical capabilities are probably not nearly as extensive as some have assumed, but that prevention to some extent is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of what some minority voices say, Mr Schmid was not more preoccupied with industrial espionage than with individual monitoring. He is proposing no less than eight specific measures to enhance the protection of citizens’ rights within the framework of various international treaties, and he calls upon the Member States and the Council to adopt at least seven specific national legislative measures to protect citizens. Of course, some specific measures are proposed to assist businesses, but these are more vague and their scope is less extensive than the measures on individual monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">As a citizen of a country whose intelligence service is certainly very small-scale compared to those of its larger neighbours or allies, I still believe that it is misleading and futile to suggest abolishing the secret services. They exist and they will continue to exist. We should, therefore, draw political conclusions and seek solutions at this level – we should monitor the activities of these services, subject them to legal and parliamentary scrutiny, adopt uniform rules to protect citizens at the highest national level and apply this throughout the European Union. The proposals in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the resolution must also be seen from this perspective. With the strengthening of European security and defence policy and the EU’s increasing involvement in crisis prevention and management, collaboration amongst intelligence services is growing and the EU will eventually have to have an autonomous European intelligence capability. This can only be achieved if there is a system for democratic monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Echelon, the resolution specifically calls upon Germany and the United Kingdom to make authorisation of communications interception operations by US intelligence services on their territory conditional on their compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from having wanted to create repeated diversions, Mr Schmid has dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s, he has more than fulfilled the mandate bestowed upon him by the Temporary Committee on Echelon and he has provided Parliament with a tool to enable us to continue the work he has done in the interests of protecting citizens.</p>

This is something that the Green Group stated a long time ago in this Parliament and we have now been vindicated. However, the report fails to draw any political conclusions. It is also extremely hypocritical in that it criticises the Echelon interception system, while at the same time we are planning to establish a European secret service. In other words, it is not that there is a problem with this system as such, it is just that the EU wants to be able to do the same and have its own system. The report naively gives the impression that if you have some sort of democratic control, all will be okay.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well known fact that there is no effective public control mechanism of secret services and their undemocratic activities anywhere in the world. By their very nature, secret services cannot be controlled and therefore we, as Members of this Parliament, who claim to be concerned about human rights and basic civil liberties, should be questioning their very existence. But, on the contrary, the report serves to legitimise a European secret service which will inevitably infringe fundamental rights in the same way as the Echelon system.</p>
<p class="contents">The temporary committee and the report focus mainly on the threat to European industrial competition and the threat posed by industrial espionage. But this is not the vital and fundamental issue. The real issue at stake, which is totally lost in this report, is that nobody can communicate in confidence any more. This is the real threat to us all. Political spying is a greater threat than economic spying. Recently there have been reports in British newspapers which point out that European leaders have ordered police and intelligence agencies to coordinate their efforts to identify and track anti-capitalist demonstrators. This will give a green light to secret services to put under surveillance people whose activities are entirely democratic and legal. Whole political and social scenes will be criminalised. Very private information about people will be accessible to police and secret services without those people having any say or control.</p>
<p class="contents">The report goes to great lengths to push these kinds of dangers under the carpet. It also ignores the plans that are forging ahead on the Enfopol interception system in the EU. We, as Members of the European Parliament, should be demanding that people’s freedoms and the right to privacy, as enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention and Article 6 of the EU Treaty, are protected and that people are not forced to live under permanent control where the possibility exists that every communication they make will be accessible to unknown forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report lets the UK off the hook. It should have requested at the very least that the UK dissociate itself from the management of the Echelon system and it should also have asked Germany to close down the interception base which is located on its territory. These Member States, which are collaborating, were let off the hook totally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does exist and represents a considerable step forwards. From now on, the Union’s institutions, particularly the representatives of the Council and the Commission, will no longer be able to say that information reported in the media is inaccurate. There is, however, inconsistency between what has been ascertained and the conclusions of the report, for the system flagrantly infringes the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, because of its technical capabilities, the system nullifies the relationship of proportionality which, precisely within the meaning of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, has to exist between interference in people’s private lives and the benefits of interception for protection purposes. This is all the more serious in that interception is currently carried out by means of these technical capabilities by a third country on EU territory and to the detriment of the citizens of the countries of the Union, without the possibility of any sort of legal, administrative or parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem is that one of the countries managing the Echelon system is the United Kingdom, a Member of the European Union, while other Member States such as Germany have made their territory available for the siting of antennae, listening posts and other equipment. Quite simply, the group of English-speaking countries managing Echelon is doing what it likes with the privacy of European citizens, as is explicitly noted in point 26 of the conclusion, cited by Mrs Flesch moreover, which means that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is being infringed. However, rather than trusting the United Kingdom not to abuse the information, we should at least have recorded its infringement of this article and noted the fact that its participation in the Echelon system is incompatible with its responsibilities under the European Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine safeguarding of fundamental rights in the USA is essential for the credibility and democratic legitimacy of that country. However, we have, yet again, chosen to<span class="bold"> </span>waste an opportunity, at least for us, to uphold a democratic principle. For others, on the other hand, at a historic moment when great, dark clouds are gathering over the right to dissent in the EU and at world level – as we have learnt from Genoa – it would be unthinkable to abolish or at least attempt to modify and reduce the capabilities of an indiscriminate listening system, one of the most useful systems for social monitoring and, where necessary, crime prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this report and its failure to draw the appropriate conclusions reduce the fundamental right to privacy, so solemnly enshrined in our Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to a right which only exists on paper, or rather to a right which, tragically, is worth no more than the paper it is written on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot, however, accept the political conclusion of the report, and we will therefore vote against it, and I call upon all my fellow Members to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">As previous speakers have mentioned, the report confirmed the existence of a US espionage system, operated by the Americans in collusion with two Member States, in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and of the most basic rules on respect for one’s private life, a system which involves intensive industrial espionage to the benefit of American companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has shown that the European firms Siemens, Dassault, Phillips, Thomson and Airbus were the targets of espionage, and this has consequently had a serious effect on employment in Europe, on our commercial stability and on Europe’s defence industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the Members in this House from the United Kingdom have put solidarity with the US before solidarity with Europe. This is something we regret, but the report does not answer two fundamental questions. The first is, although it has been established that at least one country, the United Kingdom, has been involved in espionage activity against Europe, in breach of the Treaty on European Union, what sanctions must we take? This is the first question, which remains unanswered. The second question is that the Committee’s work has demonstrated perfectly well that, as long as we are within NATO, and as long as we are tied to using NATO’s technical and logistical resources, an independent European and common security policy will not be possible. This is something we deplore. The conclusion of the report is quite simply disquieting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its work, the committee systematically violated the Rules of Procedure, failing to comply with the obligation for transparency in Parliament’s activities and infringing the right of access to public documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to belittle the work of committee chairman, Mr Coelho, or the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, in any way, it was necessary to organise the work in this way not in the interests of European security – which is an abstract concept in this context – but in order to conceal the responsibility of the Member States of the Union. The report states quite clearly that Echelon does exist, that it systematically spies on citizens and companies of the Member States of the Union on a huge scale and that the United Kingdom is part of the system, but it does not condemn this fact openly because systematic and generalised<span class="bold"> </span>interceptions, filtered using search engines are already being carried out by Germany, while Holland, which clearly has the necessary technology, is in the process of producing legislation which will allow it to carry out interceptions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see from the report that Echelon is a prime example of a system which does not recognise citizens’ right to privacy and subordinates privacy to national security, which is primarily endangered by the inability of politicians to foresee, prevent and deal with threats.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of all this, the practical, immediate solution that emerges from the report is to invite companies and citizens to encrypt documents, as if the indissoluble link between cryptographic, code breaking and technical interception systems were not well known.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the only political response which it is possible to give today is to be found in my minority opinion. Democratic scrutiny is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A sensitive issue, however, is the desire for more European cooperation in intelligence activities. It would have sufficed to state that cooperation in defence and security affairs gives the Member States a joint responsibility to protect privacy. The report cannot address all political considerations. Therefore, it would have been better not to include in the report any references to the desirability for closer cooperation. To date, moderate use has been made of the current capacity to exchange information. The protection of privacy is already problematic and the discrepancies between the Member States are considerable. The consistent exchange of information is therefore not very likely in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The key reason for setting up the temporary committee was the fear of industrial espionage. There is no reason to doubt that military and security targets are the primary concern of the intelligence services. As might be expected with secret service activities, proof of actual industrial espionage by the US is absent. Neither do the findings substantiate the American accusation of European corruption. Restricted supervisory scope illustrates the importance of effective access to encryption.</p>
<p class="contents">Although confidentiality typifies the very nature of the activities of intelligence services, more supervision is required. For example, Member States must monitor compliance with the mandate of the intelligence services, hence my amendment to protect communication against interception where supervision is lacking. By directing efforts to that aspect of interceptions, we can try to prevent their inappropriate use. This is one of the obligations of the Member States, pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights and does not only apply in respect of their own citizens. Similarly, Member States may not allow their intelligence services abroad to act in contravention of privacy. Similar arrangements can also be sought in a larger context, not least with the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to thank all of those who worked so hard to achieve this final outcome: the specialists and technical experts whom we invited and those who wrote and e-mailed us with their studies and opinions, the coordinators of the political groups and the Members of the European Parliament, the staff of our committee, who provided high quality support for our work and the rapporteur, Gerhard Schmid, who has produced an outstanding report and provided evidence once again of his great qualities as a human being and as a politician. It was an easy task to chair this committee with this kind of rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Echelon exists, whether under this name or any other. The European Parliament should be in no doubt about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Echelon runs a risk, a serious risk of its network being abused. This is a commercial risk, which compromises the concept of fair trade<span class="italic">,</span> but also presents a risk for civil liberties. The same Union that proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights and which I hope will make it binding cannot be negligent in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must improve the relationship between the European Union and the United States. We must be more effective. In our mission to the United States, we were well received by Congress but met with the hostility of the Administration. The report contains various important recommendations. Europe and the United States must cooperate fairly – and I mean fairly – for the sake of the common values that they most definitely share.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, 44 recommendations have been tabled. Giving the lie to those who predicted that the committee would not produce anything tangible, we are making 44 recommendations to the House. I must emphasise the need to strengthen the European Convention on Human Rights with regard to protecting privacy in the information society, the need for Parliamentary and judicial control over the activity of the secret services, the need to extend defence practices such as the use of cryptography and electronic signatures, and the need for the European Institutions themselves to set an example by using these technologies. Lastly, the request is made to the Union’s Member States to ensure in the future that the use of their countries by information gathering services, whether their own or of third countries, respects the European Convention on Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, first of all, a big thank-you is due to Mr Schmid for an outstanding piece of work. I think there are two good reasons for highlighting this work. For one thing, it has been a mammoth task, but I also think that Mr Schmid can justifiably be commended specifically for not having succumbed to what might be referred to as sensationalism. It would have been tempting to do so on this particular issue, but he confined himself to the facts and to what is actually the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, of course, managed to ascertain that ECHELON exists, and this naturally highlights the dilemma arising, on the one hand, from the fact that countries have a legitimate interest in using interception as one means of protecting themselves and their citizens against attacks and terrorism and, on the other, from the fact that the same citizens, as well as companies, have a need for protection against the misuse of precisely this type of surveillance. Moreover, I specifically think that Mr Schmid’s report, which we must adopt today, is forward-looking and contains sound proposals for initiatives that might be taken. I can only highlight a few of these: first and foremost, that the Member States should prepare a code of conduct to ensure the protection of citizens and companies throughout Europe, as required by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it right to point out that there is a need to reach an understanding, and arrange for an agreement to be prepared, between the EU and the United States so that there might be mutual respect for the protection of citizens and companies. We have a need for international rules in this area that are as tough as is humanly possible. The need for legal and parliamentary supervision of the intelligence services in the Member States is also emphasised. Finally, I think that the fourth important point is that both the EU and the Member States have an obligation to ensure that people are thoroughly informed about the risks of interception and about the ways in which they, as well as companies, might best protect themselves against misuse of the system. I want to say that, with this report, the Member States can no longer put their heads in the sand where this issue is concerned. They can no longer say that it is just something they have read about in the newspapers. There is now a need for countries to take responsibility for protecting their citizens and companies against violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But do you realise that it only managed to surface thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament? For when I questioned the Council and Commission about this in 1997, my questions were not at all taken seriously. This situation is now very different. The Dutch government has issued a report in which a reasonable case is made for the existence of ECHELON and the Council has also said that it supports our findings.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United States too, it has been openly admitted that 5% of all information the US collects for economic purposes originates from non-open sources. According to an estimate, this translates for American industry into more than 7 billion dollars in the way of contracts. That is why agreements must be made globally, preferably in the context of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Cryptography is a crucial point in the debate on protecting citizens and businesses. The protection of privacy via legislation is only effective if the law is enforced. Enforcement is much more difficult if cross-border espionage is involved. That is why it is necessary to encrypt information, and people must be equipped to protect themselves against espionage.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, I should like to hear from Commissioner Liikanen as to what his proposals for additional legislation or measures in this field are. For whatever is technologically possible will be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a temporary committee has been set up, which is something. Although a committee of enquiry might have revealed more secrets, I can now say that it is not the lack of facts which disappointed my group, it is the conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Tapping can be necessary sometimes, but the improper tapping of our citizens and non-governmental organisations contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, because it is disproportionate by definition. Although the European Convention on Human Rights has been mentioned, the conclusions do not state in so many words that ECHELON violates citizens’ rights. Similarly, it is not written anywhere that the United Kingdom and Germany must stop facilitating ECHELON. Of course, the world will not immediately change by a vote we take in Parliament, but that does not mean that that vote is unimportant: we need to make it clear what is and what is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands will soon be debating a law on intelligence and security services in parliament. This law legitimises ECHELON-type activities. An increasing number of governments want to narrow the information gap compared with other governments by setting up large-scale and improper tapping operations themselves. It is our task to stop this snowball effect by making clear, political statements against the violation of human rights. Otherwise, I have no choice but to vote against this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself did not vote in favour due to the poor quality of the report’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Echelon is, in fact, one of the essential parts of the NSA, a sprawling global espionage network which employs approximately 90 000 people and which has the technical capacity to carry out hundreds of millions of interceptions each day. This system is a real instrument of war against individual freedoms, and is controlled by only eight people, one of whom is the President of the United States, cynically called the ‘gang of eight’ by the chairman of the Congress monitoring committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The industrial and political espionage system was set up during the Cold War and its role is to defend what some dare to call the free world. The people who hold these views met us in Washington, in this state of mind and not without a degree of annoyance. They asked us why we had come to try to cause trouble for them, when the money, armies and secret services of both the United States and Europe are defending the same values. These are values that mean, for example, that on entry visas to the United States, the question ‘Are you involved in Communist activities?’ has been replaced by ‘Are you involved in terrorist activities?’ It is now clear why no state or company has ever complained about the workings of Echelon – it is obviously to acknowledge the debt for services rendered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now known that the United Kingdom and Germany act as intermediaries in this system, despite being members of the European Union and signatories of all the conventions on human rights. Other countries, however, such as France, have similar practices. Our response to Echelon will not be fine sounding speeches or technical measures such as encryption. We will respond by providing accurate information to the public about the choices it has in terms of society and by strictly applying the basic rights enshrined in the conventions on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial espionage is the lot of a society motivated by profit and competition; political espionage is the by-product of an undemocratic society and this is the basic problem posed by the Echelon system. We must respond to the global policing of interceptions with vigilance and popular intervention on a global scale and I maintain that European laws of today are better equipped to protect people against industrial espionage than against individual espionage. This is one perception of Europe, but it is one that I do not support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main conclusion is that completely convincing documentation has now successfully been put together to show that this worldwide surveillance system does in fact exist, but that is something of which we were, in actual fact, already well aware. The Committee has assembled and registered documentation that has actually been available for years, at any rate to whoever has been prepared to do research into this state of affairs. However, it is valuable to have the huge amount of documentation that has been assembled. It is required reading for every democrat.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is, of course, where the impotence comes in, first of all through the documentation we have to do without. The report concludes that it is ‘surprising, not to say worrying, that many senior Community figures including European Commissioners, who gave evidence to the temporary committee, claimed to be unaware of this phenomenon’. The statement is the closest approximation to an acknowledgement of the fact that the senior figures in the Commission are hiding behind a wall of silence and selective memory loss. To put it bluntly, they are full of lies. Did you hear that, Commissioner? A further demonstration of impotence lies in the sad conclusion that there is no effective supervision in terms of the national constitutions. The report has an annex containing a survey of parliamentary and judicial supervision in the Member States. Quite a few Member States have neither judicial nor parliamentary supervision and others – such as my own country, Denmark – have formal systems which, in practice, have shown their astonishing lack of effectiveness. The sad answer to the question, ‘Who watches the watchmen?’, is nobody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The results of the work of the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON interception system, in my view, send the important political signal that the European institutions, and in particular the Commission, must take much more care over the security of their communications and that the Member States and the European Union must create a new legal framework to protect their citizens and to guarantee that the privacy of their communications is not jeopardised as a result of interception because those States have the technological means and potential to use it inappropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">These days, electronic mail, mobile telephones, videoconferencing and the Internet have broken down the physical borders between countries across the world. And the most serious thing is that organised crime is using these means for their own advantage and even funding. This gives rise to a question: why not direct all this potential for intercepting communications which, as has been demonstrated, the countries making up the ECHELON system have at their disposal, to combat terrorists, drug traffickers or the organised mafias which traffic in human beings, instead of using it for an international competition between States which is unfair by any reckoning?</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States of the European Union must dedicate all their efforts to defending the rights of their citizens, whether they be economic, social or political in nature, since anything less would represent a lack of compliance with the commitments laid down in the Treaties and, in particular, with the recent Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed at the Nice Summit by the fifteen Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Gerhard Schmid, and other colleagues on the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Schmid said, he had at the beginning a very difficult brief. Let us remember that the pressure for this report came as a result of some quite fanciful journalism in different countries and some wild, weird and wonderful assertions, most of which served to undermine the very case that the authors themselves were trying to make. The surprise of this report is the fact that very few of these allegations are substantiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers this morning have referred to the UK’s role in this matter. The report acknowledges that every state in the European Union and elsewhere in the world needs some sort of interception to protect national security, safeguard its economy and fight crime. That is nothing exceptional. All the Member States do it, cooperating with each other and with other friendly democratic countries. For example, to counter terrorism threats we need to collaborate with those who have the right skills and can help. I know the United States is helping Spain in its current difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK also already ensures that any operations on UK soil are carried out with the full knowledge and consent of the UK government and are subject to UK law. That means – I hope Mrs McKenna is listening – that everything is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I hope we can put to rest some of the assertions and allegations that are still flying around about what is going on in the UK as well. Furthermore, the UK stands completely by the conclusion reached in Council that in no circumstances may telecommunications interceptions be used to gain commercial advantage. Numerous allegations were made before the report was published. They have been repeated today by a colleague who has since left and, as Mr Schmid will testify and the report shows, there is no evidence to substantiate them. I thank the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report and Mr Coelho for chairing the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to thank him for having taken the lid off this area and for having found an appropriate balance in the report. It would not have aided further developments if Parliament had gone off in all possible directions at once. This is one of the best examples of the European Parliament’s being able to make a difference and of its being able to perform a task which otherwise could not have been carried out because the individual parliaments would not have been up to the job. It is also a good example of there being a common area of effective operation in Europe that is of potential benefit to all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the task can be summarised in three points. Is there such a thing as an ECHELON system? If so, what does it do? And is there a need for democratic initiatives? We can conclude that the system exists. Some say that we knew that already, but it is nonetheless necessary in a community founded on the rule of law to also supply proof of the fact. We can also conclude that there are unacceptable interceptions of private and commercial communications and, against that background, the European Parliament proposes a long list of initiatives concerning what can be done. Above all, a higher degree of democratic supervision could be introduced. In that connection, it was also very pleasing to hear the presidency of the Council speak here today. It offers hope that something will happen, both in the Member States and in the EU, for it is really astounding to hear those who exercise power reveal the extent of their ignorance and say that they have never heard of the system, even though there have been plenty of odds and ends written about it. Had it not been for the European Parliament, they could have remained ignorant, and there is now a rather special form of democratic deficit that amounts to the inability either to hear or to read. ‘Who watches the watchmen?’ Well, the people do, of course; and if democracy is not working, the representatives of the people must be replaced by other representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is: what does <span class="italic">Echelon </span>entail? It entails a monitoring system which is tantamount to a massive global violation of fundamental rights, infringing not only the privacy of industrial communications but also the privacy of every form of communication between individuals. This violation of human rights is surely the real scandal of <span class="italic">Echelon</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">But what exactly is the statement on this issue from the European Parliament? The essence of the message contained in this report is, in fact, that we condemn this system because it is operated primarily by the United States and because it works too well. What countermeasure does the report propose? As a countermeasure, it proposes the establishment of an EU intelligence service. As we know, there are also monitoring standards such as ETST, and European monitoring plans bearing the name <span class="italic">Enfopol</span> have come to light too. Neither of these points is mentioned in the report, which essentially focuses on the monitoring that is undertaken by national intelligence agencies in violation of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are tempted to follow the path that some Members would wish us to pursue and restrict our efforts to establishing control over the intelligence services, relying on democratic control of these bodies to solve the problem, we must first look at the various secret services around the world; as we do this, it will become clear to us that democratic control has never worked. I know of no country in which it works. So in my view it is no solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one more point on the subject of foreign policy, to which several references have already been made. If an EU armed force is established, the logical consequence would be the creation of an EU intelligence service as well. I am opposed to both of these developments, because I believe they will result in the militarisation of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is any serious intention to create an area in which peace, security and justice reign supreme, the intelligence services will have to be disbanded; the surveillance authorities will also have to be dissolved. Then, perhaps, even former employees of the surveillance authorities will be taking advice from computer hackers on how to protect themselves with the utmost effectiveness against government infringement of their fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, we conclude that there is in fact such a thing as ECHELON, and then this politically elected assembly chooses not to draw political conclusions. We then go on to conclude that privacy is being violated, whereupon the European Parliament, which at other times talks of course about guaranteeing people’s rights, chooses to shift responsibility for guaranteeing these rights from the EU and the Member States to the individual citizen who then has to protect himself through encryption. Finally, the observation is made that Great Britain and Germany are, in different ways, parties to this cooperation, and yet the report recommends ever closer cooperation on intelligence matters and no conclusions are drawn in relation to the two Member States that are involved in infringing our rights. On the contrary, they are free to participate in this cooperation. I believe that the European Parliament has lost an opportunity to make it clear that it is serious about citizens’ rights. It is more than just a matter of high-flown speeches and expensive documents. It is also about taking action, and action is what is completely missing from the report.

You have all carried out important work.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHELON proved to be less extensive than we had believed, and the issue has now been somewhat defused. The ECHELON debate has nonetheless helped increase awareness of these issues, something which was vital. Interception and military espionage are phenomena which we shall not be able to abolish, or which we even wish to abolish, as long as terrorism and threats to the EU and its citizens exist. The issue for the future concerning the way in which total security systems are to be developed without violating fundamental principles has advanced a stage.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no proof that the United States has damaged global competitiveness by spreading information about companies. However, the report shows the need we have to develop security and encryption. I particularly welcome the clear opposition to bribes. As a Swede, I feel that is an extremely good development.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, cooperation at EU level on this issue involves having national control stations in accordance with the network proposed. The committee’s work on ECHELON helped bring us closer together, thanks to the very special qualities of the rapporteur, Mr Schmid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is to be congratulated on presenting us today with a report which is exceptional in terms of both methodology and content. Another exceptional feature of the report, to my mind, is the response it has already evoked far beyond the bounds of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Just recently I had the opportunity to discuss the contents of the report with prominent US senators. Firstly, they were very familiar with the report – which is highly unusual for one of our parliamentary reports – and, secondly, they did not question its findings and even expressly confirmed the designation or codename <span class="italic">Echelon</span>. How different this was to the situation only a few months ago, a situation that had prevailed over a number of years, when the observations we made in the pursuit of our efforts to clarify the <span class="italic">Echelon </span>question fell on many a deaf ear.</p>
<p class="contents">The dismissive and stonewalling replies to the questions we have put to past and present commissioners, such as Mr Bangemann and Mr Bolkestein, as well as to the Council, fill bulky volumes in our private archives. This makes our constructive cooperation on this occasion with Commissioners Liikanen and Vitorino all the more gratifying, and I should like to lay special emphasis on that point. I am therefore confident that the Commission will help us to ensure that the concrete measures proposed in our draft report are actually taken, particularly the legislative measures to improve the protection of European citizens and European companies, the specific proposal for an additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which would elucidate Article 8, efforts to reach a much needed agreement with the United States and many more measures besides.</p>
<p class="contents">We must appeal to the Member States to desist from any illegal activities in which they may have been engaging, to exercise more effective democratic control of their intelligence agencies and to attach greater importance to protecting the rights of all citizens of the European Union in addition to those of their own nationals.</p>

The most important conclusion may appear simple: ECHELON does in fact exist. It took a long time for us to establish this, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to highlight two aspects of the report. In my view, there is not enough about personal privacy and the protection of individuals. That is why it was good that the rapporteur should have especially emphasised those issues in his presentation. As was also pointed out, management interests are obviously very important, but these are not the whole story.</p>
<p class="contents">According to certain indices, the surveillance system has not only been used for industrial espionage, but also for intercepting the communications of individuals or organisations. ECHELON has, of course, the capacity to intercept communications such as e-mails, faxes and telephone conversations between individuals. The British journalist Duncan Campbell even believes that ECHELON is used to intercept communications from Amnesty and the Red Cross. If that is true, it is an incredibly serious matter. Just as was stated earlier, the EU will, in that case, have to be able to take action, in common with national parliaments and governments. In a democratic state governed by law, protection of the individual must always come first, just as the President-in-Office of the Council indicated earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns encryption. Encryption offers the only effective protection against interception. However, encryption technology is still in its infancy, and there are quite a few barriers to the export of civil encryption systems. Nonetheless, the extensive exchange of information that takes place in Europe lends topicality to the issue of common standards and rules for encryption. The institutions of the EU must be able to act jointly on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I should like, if I may, to focus on one point. As I understand it, Echelon allows certain Member States of the European Union – one Member State at least and maybe others – to attend top-level meetings in the European Union armed with knowledge of the negotiating tactics, positions and strategy of the other Member States. What I want to know is, if this is true, then exactly what are the final decisions worth? How can we trust them, how biased, to use the English expression, are they? And how can the Heads of State and Government of the other Member States accept them?</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, I would be most interested in hearing your views on this.

I would also like to thank Mr Schmid who has obviously worked very hard on this issue, even though I disagree with some of the points in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution poses a fundamental problem. It highlights that the Echelon system exists and was set up by the United States with the help of the United Kingdom, in particular. On the other hand, the resolution raises the problem of whether the participation of an EU Member State in the Echelon system is compatible with European law. This is a genuine problem in cases where Echelon is used to carry out commercial or industrial espionage and to quote from paragraph F of the resolution “if the system is misused for the purposes of gathering competitive intelligence, such action is at odds with the Member States’ duty of loyalty and with the concept of a common market based on free competition, so that a Member State participating in such a system violates EC law.”</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this point is fundamental and that is why this report, in spite of its values, leaves me with mixed feelings. In particular, I do not accept the way the use of the territory of a Member State by a third party state – whether or not an ally – is trivialised with the argument that another Member State, France, in this case, could have the resources to set up its own global interception system. This is not the same situation at all and that was not part of the work of the Echelon Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, economic conflicts can be very serious and industrial espionage is only an instrument and, therefore, we should perhaps take care to ensure that we do not use this sort of war-mongering vocabulary to refer to our allies, and, even more so, to the EU Member States. We in Parliament have a right to expect the Member State or States involved, the Council and the Commission to take preventative measures and action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report and its extensive conclusions and recommendations section, in particular, represent a major contribution on the part of Parliament to the protection of European citizens’ and companies’ freedom. The main results have already been presented by Mr Schmid and so I will not go back over that ground in my speech, although not all the conclusions are consistent with some of the information given in the report, as Mr Di Lello pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">To increase the effectiveness of the report and with a view to the protection of citizens’ privacy, in particular, as well as companies, may I suggest to Mr Schmid, once again, and to the Members that they include some amendments tabled by Mr Di Lello and others, specifically Amendments Nos 12, 20, 21, 22 and 30. These amendments have been rejected by the temporary committee but I believe this was purely out of concern for practicality. It has, in fact, been maintained that a form of huge-scale, global non-differentiating interception such as Echelon, based solely on recognition of a number of keywords and using search engines, would be invaluable for combating terrorism and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the amendments which I recommend should be put to the vote state, on the other hand, clearly – and rightly so – that these interceptions are contrary to the principle of legality and proportionality which should govern every operation compromising the confidentiality of communications, and therefore cannot be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that, in the future, we will have to amend the laws in question in line with the development of information technology but, as things stand at the moment, this is the situation. Including the amendments cited in the Schmid report would be a decisive contribution towards ensuring that the European citizens feel that their interests are fully represented and that the Unions’ institutions do not lose credibility as a result of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wiretapping and spying are an intolerable invasion of people’s privacy and are in direct contravention of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Cold War ended, a massive system that had reached the pinnacle of its development sought a fresh role: it would seem to have gone from spying on enemies to spying on friends. It was exactly the same in NATO: when the communist system ended the highly paid personnel who depicted images of enmity suddenly looked around for new roles to play, and they appear to have found them. It even feels as if a sort of bellicose mood somehow lingers in the United States of America. They are now building a missile shield against a threat that is actually hard to see. Furthermore, certain recent selfish moves on the part of the new US administration seem bewildering to us here in multicultural Europe. What is actually happening over there? Perhaps we ought to go and take another look, as only one in three of our American colleagues have a passport. They are notoriously not the most widely travelled of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must now establish a watertight agreement at charter level that we do not engage in industrial espionage amongst one another, and our most important trading partner and friend, the United States, must be persuaded to adhere to this principle. At the same time we must ensure that we are able to check that nobody is violating the privacy of European Union citizens. And thirdly, here in the appropriate committees, we must continually monitor the situation to ensure that that is what is happening. We have important work to do in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and our own United Kingdom excelled in this sort of espionage by setting up Εchelon, as our committee has confirmed thanks to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, and the coordinators.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Εchelon is one of the greatest scandals of all time. It is a political scandal, it is an economic scandal and it is a scandalous mass violation of human rights and the rules of democracy, which is why any strategic plan dealing with Echelon-type espionage systems should force governments and international organisations to face squarely up to their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation needs to go hand in glove with legal guarantees that both privacy and the rules of healthy competition will be protected. We need to improve the security of information technology infrastructures and the application of efficient parliamentary and judicial controls on how secret services operate at national and European level, otherwise our citizens will lose all confidence in the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, European companies need to develop ways of protecting themselves by reviewing their internal procedures, informing and training staff and using firewalls to protect their electronic communications. Healthy competition between companies should be the cornerstone of the global economy. In all events, intelligence services should operate on the basis of respect for fundamental rights, as set out in the Charter and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is high time we gave European citizens an answer to their question: <span class="italic">quis custodiet ipsos custodies</span>? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In theory, the European Union could certainly negotiate a memorandum of understanding allowing the Member States to use this information but, for the moment and in the short term, the European Union must think about protecting itself autonomously with a different cryptographic system from those currently in place, such as the state of the art Hermes system which is the product of European research, with remote point-to-point transport so that the data cannot be captured by the spy satellite.</p>
<p class="contents">The report appears to avoid this specific question: can the use of data collected using Echelon by the security services of one of the Member States, the United Kingdom, actually lead to tangible cases of espionage against European citizens or companies by the United States? These are questions which we must ask ourselves, seeing as the same US Congress raised the issue of whether the surveillance carried out by the NSA on US citizens was not a practice which contravened the Constitution. It has been said and must be said again that even NGOs such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace and even people who are completely above suspicion such as Mother Teresa of Calcutta have been intercepted by the Echelon system. That is worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of STOA, an ex-Member of Parliament, Mr Pompidou, commented that many European companies have already<span class="bold"> </span>suffered because of<span class="bold"> </span>the existence of ECHELON, but they do not expose it because they still trade with the United States and have to continue to do so in the future. Therefore, we wonder what legal protection there is to protect European companies against such damages. What means do they have of proving that they have been wronged? Moreover, what funding is there for European research in major, strategic sectors such as cryptography? These are questions which the report does not answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Parliament as a whole for this very important debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been following the parliamentary work over the past year with great interest. The issue touches on complex technological and political considerations. The report presents a large number of references to the existence of a global interception system. These build up a body of evidence. The Commission stated on 30 March last year: “It is the very nature of intelligence activities that those that are not involved in those activities are not able to confirm nor deny their existence”. Even though the Commission is not involved in intelligence gathering activities, we do not question the findings of the European Parliament. The report by the Echelon Temporary Committee is based on careful and thorough work.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is founded on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, based on Article 6 of the Treaty and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. As the guardian of the Treaty, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to the observance of those principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The abuse of large-scale communications intelligence is something that can make an individual living in a democratic society feel very uneasy. Privacy is a fundamental right. Any derogation from this right has to be specifically provided for by law, necessary for the achievement of objectives, in the public interest, proportionate and subject to adequate checks and guarantees against any form of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is determined to look at the practical implications of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights where, in particular, the protection of communications and personal data will be further enhanced. The Commission has already stated that it considers it would be preferable for the Charter to be integrated into the Treaties for the sake of visibility and legal certainty. At the same time, the Community has to act within the scope of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings of the committee concerning the compatibility of a system of the Echelon type with EU law distinguish between two scenarios. First, the use of such a system purely for intelligence purposes and second, abuse of the system for the purpose of gathering competitive intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the opinion that the operations envisaged in the first scenario in the interest of state security fall within the scope of title V of the Treaty on European Union, which sets out the framework for the establishment of a common foreign security policy. This lays down no provisions on intelligence activities. Member States remain responsible for the conduct and supervision of intelligence operations, unless the Council decides otherwise. The EU Treaty does not empower the Commission to exercise its prerogatives as guardian of the Treaty in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining an interception system for the purpose of gathering intelligence, even in the context of a Member State’s defence or national security, is outside the scope of the directives in force on data protection. As to the second scenario, the gathering of competitive intelligence does not come within the scope of a common foreign and security policy. It is not an activity that would be allowed in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy. As far as Community law is concerned, such activity could fall within the scope of data protection directives. This is the case if data gathered by Echelon-type systems is collected or subsequently passed on to commercial undertakings for purposes unrelated to the prevention of criminal offences or state security matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life. Properly functioning electronic communications infrastructures are crucial for our economies. As was stated in Lisbon, Europe wants to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. A precondition for this is the need to build trust in electronic communications. This concerns both our citizens and our businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The development in technologies can bring protection against surveillance. It is reassuring that the use of fibre-optic cables instead of satellites for transcontinental communications has decreased the possibilities for large-scale routine interception.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that the rise of the commercial Internet has significantly diminished the possibilities for interception is convincing. Today the majority of Internet communications by cable no longer leave the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken important steps over the past years to develop a policy to improve the security of electronic communications. Encryption has been mentioned here often. The availability and free circulation of encryption products and technologies in the European Union has now been ensured with the dual-use regulation in place since September 2000. The support, through the Community’s research framework programme, in particular with the information side of technologies programme, has improved the conditions to develop top-of-the-range European encryption products in order to enable EU citizens, companies and governments to protect their communications. I would ask for your support in this context in our discussions on the next framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not sufficient to guarantee a widespread use of encryption. Citizens and small businesses are not always aware of the potential effects. We need to inform them about the possibilities of encryption. We need to empower them. In June this year the Commission adopted a communication on network and information security. The purpose is to tackle this awareness problem and to further develop a European approach on security-related issues. I am pleased to note that the conclusions of the report under discussion are very much in line with the approach adopted by the Commission. The honourable Members are aware that there is already a legal framework in place at EU level addressing data protection and obligations for operators. There is also an emerging policy on cybercrime, which will be discussed later today. Network information security is now coming as a third element to complete the picture. However, communication is not meant to contain a fully fledged action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already initiated some broad action lines where progress needs to be made. I will highlight some of them. To raise awareness, public information and education campaigns should be launched and best practice should be promoted. A European warning and information system is needed to strengthen the activities of computer emergency response teams – CRTs – or similar entities and improve the coordination amongst them. I have noted Parliament’s support for this idea. Then we need to examine how best to organise at European level proactive and coordinated measures to develop forward-looking responses to existing and emerging security threats like the European information security observatory. Finally concerning the legal framework, we will set up an inventory of national measures which have to be taken in accordance with the relevant Community law. Here I reply to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel’s question.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that further action is needed to support the development of technology, to streamline standardisation and certification work, and for the introduction of security in government use and better international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As a next step, it is our intention to develop a road map before the end of this year containing concrete actions with firm deadlines in order to start putting a European information security policy in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is constantly improving the production of its own information systems in terms of availability, integrity and confidentiality, especially in view of the changing nature of the various existing and potential threats. The entry point to the Commission networks is constantly monitored and actively tested. Similar efforts are conducted through projects for secure video conferencing, secure telephone systems and encryption of databases. Furthermore, security audits of Commission information systems are conducted on a regular basis. A new information system security policy has been drafted and is currently being prepared for discussion within the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is reviewing its overall security policy as a result of internal reorganisation activities and policy developments. The new internal Commission security provisions will follow the model of the Council security regulation adopted earlier this year and will be based on the following principles: proportionality of security measures in relation to existing risks; shared responsibility and accountability of staff, management and security experts; the creation of all elements into a coherent security strategy, such as personal information and physical security; and finally, close cooperation between European and national security organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to allocate additional resources to the security domain. However, scarce technical and human resources, especially in the field of information security specialists, hamper the full deployment of security policies. This concern is common to most public administrations including the European institutions. I welcome the support in the report to allocate more resources for the task to be undertaken and I sincerely hope that Parliament as a budgetary authority will follow the position of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The trust of European citizens and businesses in electronic communications and the well-functioning of information infrastructures has become crucial for economies. Let me reiterate once more that the Commission attaches the utmost importance to respect for human rights and respect of rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
