<p class="contents">This will also be our last meeting before the International AIDS Conference which will take place in August in Toronto. As you know, Toronto will offer the Commission a first rate platform to express its vision for dealing with the scourge of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission obviously remains very concerned about the problem of HIV/AIDS. Despite our efforts, this scourge continues to spread throughout the world. It now affects tens of millions of people, infecting more and more girls and young women. The countries most affected are still the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where the rate of infection is not falling and where the disease continues to undermine any prospect of human, social and economic development worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this tragedy, the European Commission is more determined than ever to vigorously support its partners in Africa and elsewhere. Our goal is to give them the tools to fight this pandemic by combining prevention, treatment and care in an effective manner. However, in addition to these measures we remain convinced that HIV/AIDS cannot be treated in isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the fight against HIV/AIDS cannot be dissociated from the fight against other diseases that are also linked to poverty, notably malaria and tuberculosis. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS brutally exposes all the biggest challenges for development: limited access to social services, exaggerated inequalities – whether social or between men and women – bad government and corruption, as well as the persistently extremely low level of economic and technological development. In a word, the blatant inadequacy of the state with respect to essential governmental functions.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way that HIV/AIDS can be combated successfully is if the leaders of developing countries address all these problems at the same time. This integrated approach to HIV/AIDS is the principal driving force for the Community’s action, and it also forms the basis of our approach in concert with the Member States, and also with our other partners at the heart of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The main financial instrument to which the Commission has recourse is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which devotes around 57% of its resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS. We favour the use of this Global Fund because at the moment it is the most rapid and effective means to provide aid that can be allocated by the beneficiary countries in an integrated way.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Commission plays a key role in administering this Fund; it has, effectively, a sort of Vice-Presidency. Since the creation of the Global Fund at the end of 2001, the Commission has contributed up to EUR 522 million, or 11% of the total contributions. If we include the contributions of the Member States of the European Union, then we are obviously, by far, the principal backer of this Fund, providing around 60% of the total Fund. I should also say that a few months ago I participated in the replenishment of this Fund in London, and I will not conceal the fact that we were fairly disappointed that participants were somewhat lukewarm, even reserved, about replenishing the Fund. We are a long way from the objective that we set ourselves, and therefore great efforts must be made to mobilise donors.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus we are implementing a series of financial support measures, projects and programmes. Among these measures we are giving precedence to general budgetary support. This approach is in accordance with our priority, which is to let our partners take control of their own policy and thus their own destiny. In line with this stance, the Commission has committed EUR 2.4 billion since 2002 to the general budget for Africa alone, where the impact of HIV/AIDS is by far the most serious.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course involved in an ongoing political dialogue with our partners regarding the use of these funds. This dialogue also aims at encouraging them to implement an integrated approach – I mean, in particular, by including questions regarding human rights and good governance. I also mean gender equality, as well as discrimination and acts of violence against women, and access to education for girls.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these efforts through the Global Fund and through bilateral action, the Commission is actively participating in international forums for dealing with poverty-related illnesses – I am thinking in particular here of the World Trade Organisation, of the United Nations General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS, of the G8, and of conferences like the one in Toronto as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has played a decisive role in making sure that on these occasions the European Union speaks with a united voice on this question. Moreover, the Commission has also been engaged for several years in a dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry in order to speak in favour of making medication available to developing countries at lower prices. This dialogue has borne fruit: the introduction of a graded price scale has enabled the price of certain medicines to be reduced by 95%. This system allows developing countries to pay prices in accordance with their means, while at the same time protecting the businesses that produce these medicines from the risk of seeing their products imported back into the very lucrative markets of the developed countries. In 1999, a complete antiviral HIV treatment cost USD 10 000. Today it costs USD 200.</p>
<p class="contents">We are engaged in research ourselves, in cooperation with industry and with the research centres of Member States, and our efforts are in particular directed towards finding microbicides and vaccines. We have also launched a partnership to coordinate the research programmes of Member States in order to accelerate clinical testing and thereby to ensure that medications may be put onto the market more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must go further in our fight against HIV/AIDS, in order to be able to provide preventative measures and treatment to all those who need them by 2010. In this respect, we are following – with great interest – the implementation of innovative funding mechanisms by certain Member States, in particular the tax on aeroplane tickets. We are also glad to see increasing contributions from private foundations, such as the Bill Gates Foundation, to the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">The creativity of these solutions, as well as the increasing involvement of the private sector, give me cause to hope. This reflects a realisation – that is increasingly being transformed into action – of the threat represented by HIV/AIDS and of the need to respond to it in a proactive way in order to preserve our common future. We must not relax our vigilance, and we must continue our work without respite. We can attain our ultimate goal, which is to provide care to all those who need it and to see future generations grow up without the fear of AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to be able to continue to collaborate with the European Parliament in order to turn this objective into reality. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know those figures that we quote in every debate, the 40 million people living with AIDS, the 20 million who have died from AIDS, the 12 million AIDS orphans, the 2.5 million children living with AIDS, but there are new aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the fact that around half of the people who now have AIDS and are dying of the disease are women. There is the problem of where AIDS is on the increase. India is now the country with the most cases of AIDS. It has overtaken South Africa, it has two thirds of the cases in Asia, and yet in India only 7% of the people who need the anti-retrovirals are receiving them.</p>
<p class="contents">We see children missing out on the HIV drugs they should be receiving. Only one in twenty HIV-positive children are receiving the treatment they need, and the Global Movement for Children recently reported that four million children are desperately in need of Cotrimoxazole, the antibiotic costing just three cents per child per day that could prevent life-threatening infections in children with HIV and those born to HIV-positive mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">Closer to home, on our doorstep, we see the figures in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the numbers infected have increased almost 20-fold in less than a decade, and between 2003 and 2005 the number killed by AIDS has almost doubled. So, Commissioner, we join you in your resolution to do more. We want to see much more done in terms of prevention. We have seen in Senegal and Uganda how investment in prevention can really work and make a difference. We need to see that rolled out, particularly in Africa and in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to see investment in research. With research into new drugs and vaccines and the delivery of drugs, the children I have referred to who are now living with and dying of AIDS can have hope for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope you still managed to enjoy a very interesting match between France and Portugal. I am also indebted to the Commissioner for his statement. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was relieved when the High-Level UN meeting on HIV/AIDS in New York recently stated that there needs to be a great deal of catching-up if the objective of universal access to the prevention of HIV, its treatment and attendant care for all people is to be achieved. Whilst it is indeed true that progress has been made, the UN AIDS report, from which Mr Bowis quoted a few examples a moment ago, clearly shows that our actions should gather momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">My group was therefore disappointed that the political statement that has been made contained so little in the way of specific commitments. Hence the importance of this debate and of the meeting in Toronto, where the international community must prove that it takes its commitments really seriously, and that platform must be used not only to enter into political, but also financial, commitments. In Toronto, the countries involved must also be able to make it clear that they are serious about global and cohesive policy on HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union must also do its bit and pull up its socks. There are four specific things that I would like to hear from you, commitments that the PSE Group would like to see featured on the Toronto agenda. The 6% for human and social development within the new development cooperation instrument is, to our mind, just a little too low. We would very much like to see this percentage increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think it should be possible to spend no less than 50% of official development cooperation on Millennium Development Objectives, among which HIV/AIDS should occupy centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is only right and proper, to our mind, that the European Union should commit to sustaining and, ideally, increasing, its contribution to the World Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we would very much welcome it if the Commission were to provide active support to those developing countries that commit themselves to prioritising basic health care and the fight against HIV/AIDS. As the UN report on AIDS states, we know what needs to be done in order to stop AIDS in its tracks. What we now need is the political will and the funds to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has stressed to me the importance of full access to anti-retroviral drugs, not least because many more people come forward for voluntary testing when there is effective treatment available for those who test positive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am also told that there are real practical problems with European Commission funding. It is only very local, community-level projects that can manage to overcome stigma and discrimination and get people to talk about sex openly and that offer individual counselling and care. Yet these local NGOs, which deliver significant success in terms of changed attitudes towards AIDS, find that their applications for European funding are often turned down.</p>

<p class="contents">The UN’s 2006 report on AIDS shows successes being achieved in all countries where enormous efforts are made at prevention, but it also shows that there are massive deficiencies in the prevention and combating of HIV/AIDS. It is not a matter of doubt that one of the most disturbing things in this report is the fact that programmes for preventing HIV are not only deficient, but also, where they are in place at all, fail to reach those groups that are most at risk. Efforts at informing young people are still inadequate, and that really is very disturbing indeed when one considers that there are more young people alive now than ever before, and that young people are more vulnerable to infection than other age groups.</p>
<p class="contents">It was five years ago that 189 states adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, unanimously – a rare enough thing in itself – committing themselves to meeting the enormous challenge that HIV/AIDS constitutes to the development of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">We know – as has already been said – what has to be done to deal with rising rates of infection, to prevent the disease spreading further and treat those who have become ill as a result of it, but there is an obvious lack of the necessary political will, and it is for that reason that we, in our resolution, are critical – as are many representatives of global civil society – of the feeble and rather vague results from the high-level meeting in New York at the end of May and the beginning of June. We call on the international community to make use of the international conference in Toronto as a means of formulating clear and concrete demands and goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> (<span class="italic">FR</span>) Mr President, it is always slightly embarrassing to make do with saying that what one has just heard corresponds to one’s own convictions, but it is obvious that, like you, I agree with the majority of the points that have just been made. Even so, and in order to be entirely objective, I will make a number of comments.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been pointed out that we could find the means to resolve this crucial problem if only we wanted to. This, for me, is a major concern. Mrs Scheele put it well: it is a question of political will. For my part, I can only fight this fight by using arguments and speeches. I cannot – obviously - force Member States and international donors to be more generous. I was very shocked and surprised by the low level of commitment in London. If I recall correctly, the objective was set at USD 7 billion, and we barely reached the figure of USD 3.7 billion, which is indeed well below the initial objective. It will therefore be necessary to continue our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that I agree, of course, with Mr Bowis who argues in favour of strengthening research in this area. It is clear that research will ultimately enable us to gain a great deal of time in our efforts to eradicate this terrible evil once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the fixing of a percentage, Mrs van Lancker, even if I agree in general what you say, I would like to emphasise that we do not determine such a percentage ourselves: it is determined by the partner countries. The principle of appropriation exists and we often have to plead with our partners in order for them to agree to dedicate part of the development aid that we donate to a sector like the one under discussion this evening. This is something I consider important to remember. In other words, I am personally right behind you when you say 6%, but this does not depend entirely on us.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the developmental aid dedicated to the Millennium Development Goals, I very sincerely have the impression that in the framework of the new programme – which we are working on and for which we will need your contributions, creativity and ideas – more than 50% will be devoted to the Millennium Goals. In fact, my conviction is, and this has become an obsession with me – by the way it is, curiously enough, very difficult to find people who share it – that, in many developing countries, problems are linked to the inadequacy of the state, to the deficit in the state’s capacity to deliver social or democratic services, like access to education for girls, access to health care, access to justice, access to administration. All this is often very incomplete, and sometimes it does not even exist at all. Therefore, when we give the states in question the means to reinforce their service capacities in a general sense, then it is quite understandable that this money will also help to meet the Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your remark about maintaining our contribution to the Global Fund, we do indeed intend to maintain this contribution. I should also say that a number of Member States of the European Union set a good example in London and have made real efforts concerning the sums. It is our non-European partners who have been rather timid on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that we must provide more significant support to benefit those countries which especially make particular efforts, even if AIDS does not, unfortunately, recognise borders. We must therefore make aid payments dependent on the performance of these countries, and that is what we are doing. Moreover, as you know, the 10th European Development Fund provides a special instalment which is, precisely, intended to supply additional means in a significant quantity relative to the initially planned sum, depending on governance, on performance and also depending on, for example, investment dedicated by partner countries to the fight against AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mrs Hall, as regards local NGOs who feel that they have not been treated properly by the Commission, if you have specific NGOs with specific projects in mind, then I would like to hear about them. Be that as it may, I recognise that the Commission’s policy has been to avoid spreading credits too thinly between all sorts of projects which, taken individually and on a micro-local level, are doubtless important. In any case, it seemed to us that it was even more important for the international community to have a truly coherent communal strategy, based on a methodology that would be consistent across the board in order to deal with the problem as a whole. The Commission’s policy has been to try to make payments into the Global Fund in order that there might be a 'thinking head' capable of generating a global strategy. In any case, if an individual project is good, why not fund it, indeed. However, I remain convinced that if we dispersed ourselves between all sorts of projects then we would not be so efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the choice that the Commission has made, although it does not prevent me from being open to discussion – I am not narrow-minded. However, if certain people think that we should multiply little projects, even if they are good ones, then I remain sceptical as to the long term effectiveness of this strategy. When it comes to dealing with large scale problems like the one we are talking about this evening, I personally am in favour of adopting a much more systematic procedure. Now, if you spread out your resources among a multitude of small projects, then you lose sight of the systematic global approach and you become less effective. That would be my cause for concern. However, if you know the NGOs who have submitted these applications, please do give them and show them to me, because I do not want to give the impression of being arbitrary. Besides, I am not the one who decides – the administration submits its conclusions to me, and it is, unfortunately, not possible for me to study each application individually. Thus, if certain people believe that their applications have been treated unfairly, then I am willing to look into this question.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: you know that, within a broad European consensus, I advocate a common programme in which the contributions of European donors, Member States and the Commission are merged together. If we could truly succeed with this common programming initiative, in other words collectively agree on common objectives and decide on how to share out the work between us, then I think we would be much more effective, particularly in fighting the terrible disease of AIDS. This approach would be more coherent and perhaps then we would have a real European strategy at our disposal, something that is not the case today, as we must admit. Today, we are donors, we are investing money in the Global Fund, we finance this Fund, but we do not have our own strategy for fighting AIDS except, as I said earlier, for our plan to attack it on several fronts: gender inequality, the education of girls, care, access to health care, all those problems that the state is called upon to solve. Apart from that, we do not have a truly specific strategy for fighting AIDS. We have to admit that what we are doing is financing external operations. Therefore, if we had a common programme, we could then perhaps implement a more refined strategy that would engage in a more direct way with the specific aspects - and even local aspects - of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
