At the time, we successfully applied for the final vote on the issue of genetically modified organisms to be deferred. I then negotiated for two years on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture. The issue at stake then was not whether genetic engineering should or should not be used; the issue at stake was labelling and the inclusion of this seed directive and its methods in the release directive, which at the time was still Directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">We achieved this. At the time, the scientists still insisted that genetically modified crops could coexist alongside non-genetically modified crops; they excluded the possibility of contamination. This stand has now been overtaken both by events and by opinion within the scientific community itself. Now those who wish or rather who, under the bio regulation, are legally obliged to farm – be it conventionally or organically – without using genetic engineering, face the problem of unwanted contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Commission wants to set a threshold below which no labelling is required. This is where the figures start to get confusing. Once upon a time there was talk of 1% contamination; now we are down to 0.3 and 0.5%. But the fact remains that genetically modified organisms are being released unintentionally in huge quantities. If we relate this to an area of seven-and-a-half or eight million hectares of rape or corn, 7 million plants seed every year. This is not going to be negotiated with Parliament, not even in the Standing Committee on the release directive, which has now been renewed; it is to be decided in the Standing Committee on Seeds, where a ruling is to be laid down under the comitology procedure which, if implemented as it stands, contradicts Parliament's figure of 0.5% in the food labelling directive.</p>
<p class="contents">If we approve seeding in these quantities without labelling, then we must assume that the other value will be exceeded during seeding and that even those who do not use any form of genetically modified organism will be forced to comply with labelling and testing requirements. We need a ruling here which clarifies once and for all – and this is also the position which the Committee on Agriculture has just adopted – that there has to be coexistence, that those who wish to use genetically modified organisms must ensure that those who do not are not brought into contact with them. That applies both to the 70% of farmers in Germany who do not want GMOs and to about the same percentage of consumers who do not want GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is no point in starting from a specific threshold because, if it is exceeded, the risk and the individual costs will be impossible to bear under compensation rules. So we need a ruling whereby those who are to blame can be held to account under the polluter-pays principle. This process, these rulings are no simple matter, Commissioner, and cannot be decided under the comitology procedure or in the standing committee and technical annex; they need further debate and another vote, with codecision by Parliament. We should also hold science to account and organise hearings in order to clarify how coexistence which is really worth its name, can be applied. All this takes time and must not, under any circumstances, be rushed. Until then, the rule must be that uncontaminated seed can be guaranteed for those who do not want to use genetically modified organisms.</p>

We still do not have a clear-cut reply to some of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's questions. Please accept that my answers are to some extent preliminary ones, which will require further scrutiny and reflection, both within the Commission and in our ongoing discussions with the Member States and the different stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin with a short description of the problem we are faced with when dealing with the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional products. This is also important for everyone who has followed this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On a global scale, GMO cultivation has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2001, 5.5 million farmers in 13 countries grew an estimated 52.6 million acres with GM crops. Between 2000 and 2001, the number of acres planted to GM crops increased by almost 20%. For some crops, the increase was particularly large. In the US, GM corn increased from 4.4% of all planted acres in 1996 to 32% in 2002. GM soya beans increased from 7.4% in 1996 to 74% in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the cultivation of GMOs has been geographically concentrated, with 99% of all GM crops produced by four nations: the United States of America, Argentina, Canada and China. However, GM cultivation is likely to spread to other nations in the next few years. So far Europe has played a very marginal role, with fewer than 20 000 acres of GM crops, mainly in Spain and France. That is some 0.03% of the worldwide area.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has large volumes of trade with major GM producers – although trade in GM products has mainly concerned products for animal feed. Imports of GM products for human consumption, like maize, have largely ceased, because of the inability of exporters to ensure the identity of all individual GMOs in shipments.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few years have shown that the adventitious presence of traces of GMOs in conventional products has become inevitable. Cross-pollination between plants is a natural phenomenon – that also happens between other seeds. We simply cannot completely control its mechanisms, which include factors such as wind and insect movements. It is therefore largely unavoidable that small traces of GMOs will be transferred to conventional crops and their harvested products.</p>
<p class="contents">Storage and transportation practices may also make it difficult or extremely costly to ensure total segregation. Consequently, conventional seed lots will contain traces of GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting tolerance thresholds for impurities for GM seeds in this particular case is the only way to address the problem. Closing our market completely is not a viable option.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a Commission directive amending the annexes to the seed directives. This proposal includes additional conditions and requirements concerning the adventitious presence of GM seeds in lots of non-GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture has been informed twice about the status of this proposal. Commissioner Byrne has written to inform Mrs Jackson that the text will be formally submitted to the European Parliament, which will then have the opportunity to scrutinise it.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 21(2) of Directive 18/2001/EC provides for the possibility of establishing thresholds below which traces of authorised GMOs are exempted from labelling requirements. Hence, conventional products containing adventitious traces of such GM seeds below this threshold would not have to be labelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now answer some of the questions raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. On the competent body to set thresholds, the Regulatory Committee, provided for in Directive 18/2001/EC, is competent for decisions pertaining to thresholds under Article 21(2) of the directive, with regard to exemption from labelling requirements. However, it is not competent for decisions made under the sector-specific seeds directives, where thresholds relate specifically to marketing criteria for seeds. The Standing Committee on Seeds rightly has the necessary competence in this case. Consistency between the different pieces of legislation has to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">On the risks that a significant percentage of GM seeds may be released out of control into the environment, I would first say that it is paramount that any threshold should take account of the protection of human health and, importantly, in the case of seeds, the environment. You will be aware that this includes a comprehensive free-market assessment of the potential risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, thresholds must be workable and enforceable. The proposed thresholds arise directly from the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants and are scientifically founded with reference to the characteristics of the crop species.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the registration of GMO cultivation, under the provisions of Article 31(3)(b), Member States are required to establish registers for recording the location of GM fields grown for commercial purposes. As detailed in the article, the objective of this is to allow the possible effects of these GMOs on the environment to be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the scope of Directive 18/2001/EC, this clearly relates to cultivation of a GM seed product itself and not a conventional seed product containing traces of GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The GM seed product itself has to be labelled as such and also traced, so that growers will know what they are sowing. It will therefore be possible for Member States to record the locations of the resultant crops.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the threshold values, which are based on robust scientific assessment, should aim at ensuring that the cultivation of conventional seeds basically maintains the characteristics of non-GM cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">Coexistence is a key issue in the Commission communication on Life Sciences and Biotechnology – a Strategy for the Future. The Commission has commissioned a number of studies on this issue. The main aim is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence. So far, we only have preliminary data based on hypothetical scenarios, and further experimental data is required to provide a more accurate picture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively pursuing such work before considering possible options to ensure the viability of conventional and organic farming and their sustainable coexistence with GM crops.</p>
<p class="contents">As a further step in this process, the Commission has commenced discussions in partnership with Member States, farmers and other private operators to find the most appropriate solutions. It is important to say that the issue of coexistence is not one of risk <span class="italic">per se</span>. It does, however, highlight a possible need to establish correct agricultural management systems and practices for the different crop types to ensure their coexistence and consumer choice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my initial reply to your questions and I will be happy to make further comments at the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have said that I think it would make more sense if the Commission held fire on the regulation for GMOs in seed under the comitology procedure until Parliament has completed the current procedure. We need the new seed regulations to be consistent with the regulations on GMOs in food and feed and on the traceability and labelling of GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues were hotly debated at first reading here in this House as recently as the summer. The resolution was extremely tight on several points, especially the question of threshold values. We are now waiting for the Council of Ministers to reach a decision, which since last week has again been postponed to December. A final decision by the Council cannot now be expected before the middle of next year. I think it would be far better if the Commission were to keep its paper in the pending tray for another year, so that the threshold values can be adjusted to the regulations currently on the agenda. So much for the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for a brief material comment. The question of whether GMOs are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today's debate. But as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf refers in his question to positions on GMOs, I wish to do likewise. It is clear from all the Member's questions that there is something he has failed to understand or does not wish to admit. There is a difference between releasing GMOs under Directive 2001/18, on the one hand, and setting a technical limit value for the adventitious presence of GMOs in conventional seed by amending the annexes to the seed directives, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives contain an array of technical rules and requirements on the quality and marketing of seed in the EU. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself said that the actual directives were adopted in the usual manner after hearing the European Parliament and that it was decided in the process that certain technical details were to be regulated under the regulatory committee procedure. The committee does not of course decide on the release of GMOs, it decides how to define a further quality standard for conventional seed and it has the jurisdiction to do so under current EU law. The Commissioner said as much.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific committee has, in its turn, confirmed, as do countless other scientific works, that statistically halfway reliable statements do not brook a limit value of less than 0.1%. This is the cut-off point. There is no such thing as a 0% value, and nothing is GM-free. The Commission draft suggests threshold values for GMOs that do not represent a risk to the environment and consumers, and which can therefore be commercially cultivated in the EU. The registration requirements in Directive 2001/18 have nothing to do with the marketing of conventional seed.</p>
<p class="contents">Reproduction seed, which farmers themselves cultivate, is at times much more of a problem. It is not subject to any quality testing requirements whatsoever and does not therefore undergo any tests to detect GMOs. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself is in favour of liberalising these reproduction regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">And another thing. The lower the threshold value for the adventitious presence of GMOs is set, the more conventional and organic products will have to be labelled, which is why the Commission, various Member States and a large majority in the European Parliament are calling for a realistic limit value of 1% in the forthcoming GMO regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, may I say that working farmers need a fundamental understanding of the simple biologic facts of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of type A seed in type B. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf works as a farmer. There are such things as natural events. There will always be GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just on the mind of my group, it is, of course, also on Mrs Sommer's mind. As she said, we worked together with an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment on this issue, precisely because we have the impression that our right of codetermination is being curtailed, whatever the legal situation here; I think we all know that, Mrs Sommer. We have asked the Commission and various representatives working on this directive for a deferment on several occasions, because the message we keep getting is that the idea is to railroad these legal provisions through before the end of the year. The legislation in this area, which is currently being dealt with by the Council but which was dealt with by Parliament at first reading up to July, signals that we are taking this seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall resist the temptation to rehash the debate we held up to July, but I should like to comment on one point which is, of course, also addressed in the legislation and which, as rapporteur, I am familiar with, namely the regulation on genetically modified food and feedingstuffs. What we want to know is: what is being done to prevent technically unavoidable, unwanted contamination? What proposals does the Commission have for investigating this question? Word is spreading that we are in fact regulating something at European level. We are regulating limit values, threshold values for technically unavoidable, adventitious contamination. We all agree here that we need these limit values and that there is no such thing as completely 'GM-free'. At the same time, we are not saying that there are laws in the pipeline, there are recommendations in the pipeline tackling how this can be avoided in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If the objective – and here too we agree with the Commission – is to deny this contamination and if the objective is the coexistence of various types of farming, such as traditional and organic farming, then this is a question we really should be asking ourselves. If the Commissioner says that there are no clear-cut replies to these questions, which is perfectly understandable, then I understand even less why this is now being railroaded through here under the comitology procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have translated her Portuguese notes off the cuff, so I hope I shall be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption by the Commission of Directive 2001/18/EC on the release into the environment of GMOs, there are serious concerns relating to health, the environment and farmers’ interests. As we know, beyond the ethical issues concerning the commercialisation and patentability of life and natural heritage, the release of GMOs into the environment is irreversible and difficult to control, and can have direct consequences for the contamination of conventional agriculture and the reduction of biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, even farmers who do not cultivate genetically modified plants, due to cross-pollination or similar phenomena, are forced to label their products. This could lead to conventional farmers or organic farmers not having any choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the absence of detailed studies, does the Commission not think that the precautionary principle of maintaining the moratorium in place should prevail? How should we address the labelling of products which contain GMOs due to chance or circumstances that are difficult to avoid? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said absolutely nothing about how we are to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on a limit value of 0.5% for labelling. That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating. With your planned limit value for seed, this value is not achievable. You know that, which is why I should now like to ask you to tell us what conclusions you intend to draw from this vote by Parliament. Is it in fact that you want to press ahead, that you want to bring about a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, that you want, as it were, to give the seed industry a Christmas present? I think you should state here today how you intend to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You said just now that contamination is unavoidable. That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable! In saying this, you are setting yourself up as the mouthpiece of the genetic engineering industry because that is what the lobby claims, but it is not true. Tests in Europe have shown that there is no contamination of seed of any consequence and in Austria we even have purity requirements for seed and I think that is exactly what we need. We need freedom of choice for consumers and, in order to guarantee it, we need purity requirements. We should not just throw in the towel in the face of contamination when, with the right policy, there is no contamination, because products or seeds which cause such widespread contamination cannot be released. So what we need is freedom of choice for consumers and, please, rather than giving Christmas presents to the seed industry, give us a timetable today. We want to know what the Commission is planning to do and if it really is prepared to accept Parliament's democratic resolution and wait until we have adopted a resolution on the Scheele Report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I understand that the Commission chooses the quantitative detectability techniques in order to define the adventitious presence of GMOs. That I quite understand. In fact, you sometimes even disregard the 1% adventitious presence of GMOs because – and I agree with you here – the authorisation for the circulation of a given GMO comes under a different directive, which takes into account the risks for human health and the environment. If there is no risk to human health and the environment, an authorisation is given.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it comes to the directives on traceability, for some peculiar reason, you do not follow the principle of detectability which you follow for all the others. This will also create problems for the World Trade Organisation, because if you accept that the presence of 1% is not a problem for health and so on, why do you not accept that detectability should be included in all traceability directives? If GMOs are present, whether adventitious or not, that fact should be stated.</p>
<p class="contents">You insist on not including detectability in the traceability directives. You must abide by what you have said, namely, that all directives should be part of the same framework.

We are not discussing the release of GMOs, but the definition of a further quality standard in the marketing of conventional seed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament adopted the proposal for a regulation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs or genetically modified food and feedingstuffs at first reading in June, calling for a threshold value of 0.5%. I agree with the Commission here that this value is pitched too low and is impracticable. A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In setting threshold values for seed, which is what we are discussing here, the Commission has to take due account of Parliament's and the Council's suggested thresholds in the procedure mentioned. The threshold values for the adventitious presence of GMOs need to be coordinated in the two texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of GMOs in food and feed. Reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs. That needs to be made perfectly clear here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority. Coexistence is only possible if we have reasonable threshold values as, technically, wind-borne pollen can never be discounted in nature. One hundred percent purity was never possible for biological reasons and never will be in the future. Threshold values for product purity are standard and necessary in numerous industries. In the organic farming sector, for example, there is a threshold value of 5%. That means that products labelled as organic products may contain up to 5% of certain non-organic ingredients. I say that for the benefit of the Greens.</p>
<p class="contents">The important criterion must be that the statutory framework is practicable. More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and must not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe by tying it up in unnecessary red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I therefore ask if the Commission agrees that a Eurobarometer survey shows that 75% of Europeans favour basic research aimed at new technologies which help knowledge to progress? Is it true that, according to Eurobarometer surveys, 48% of Europeans agree or strongly agree that GM is useful in food production for improved nutrition and for improving shelf life or taste, despite the emotive campaign by the Greens to convince them of the contrary?</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are these campaigns emotionally charged, they muster distorted and misleading information to support their ultimately untenable and irrational opposition to the new technology of genetically modified crops. I wish they would be honest enough to recognise that there are at least some benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these actual benefits, not to mention the potential benefits, substantially outweigh any risks. Yes, there are always potential risks in any new technology product or process. We are challenging the frontiers of knowledge, but we have safeguards in place. We require exhaustive testing and trials in laboratory and field. But the opponents do not want proof. They condone obstruction and destruction of these trials. Will they deny that GM crops have major environmental benefits? Not only do they reduce production costs, they also cut back on the use of energy, pesticides and herbicides and reduce CO2 emissions. Though their opponents are still grasping at straws, it is clear from experience in America and elsewhere that the environment benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we can perhaps afford the luxury of denying ourselves the food productivity benefits which GM crops offer, but do our Green colleagues not consider the interests of their fellow human beings in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia to whom GM crops will bring nutrition and health benefits and may even help them survive? Do they consider the effect that turning our backs on this advance will have on our scientific base and researchers, on our farmers and farm workers' jobs? On thousands of jobs in the food processing industry? On the price of food as well as the quality and the variety available to our consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, European consumers are entitled to be able to choose what food they buy and eat. We must protect our environment as best we can, but we also owe it to our constituents to be frank and honest about the risks and benefits. It is accepted that an organic label indicates 95% organic, i.e. up to 5% not organic. Why make the non-GMO label almost unobtainable by specifying unachievable levels of purity? I could well accept that premise, with the mischievous intention of making non-GMO so rare that no one could afford it. Then everyone will be forced to come to terms with the real world, where there will always be the possibility of some adventitious GM content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know from Eurobarometer opinion polls that most people are worried about GMOs. At the same time, they say that they do not know enough about them. Perhaps there is a connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Breyer that we have looked at those concerns very carefully to ensure that we establish clear legislation – a clear framework – for handling both the potential benefits and the risks of GMOs. That is why we have revised Directive 18/2001/EC to include better risk assessment and better information, so that consumers can make an informed choice. That is why we have proposed further legislation on traceability and labelling. However, it would not be honest to say that if we continue to import seeds, for example, we can guarantee total purity and no adventitious presence of GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that everything in nature escapes – through cross-pollination for example – so closing borders is not a viable solution. We have to be pragmatic and establish levels and thresholds to deal with natural phenomena. We have to look at the situation as it actually is and at the products we import.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to Mr Trakatellis' question about traceability. The proposals on traceability and labelling, as well as on food and feed, are not based entirely on the detectability of GMOs. Even if they cannot be detected, consumers have the right to know. The current Novel Foods Regulation will be replaced by these proposals and the scope will be broadened to give consumers a choice, even if the GMOs are not detectable. Consumers have the right to be informed of the presence of GMOs in the products they buy, even if the GMOs are not detectable.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment on two further issues that have been raised. Firstly, on labelling thresholds, the Commission can only take account of existing legislation and, for the time being, a 1% threshold is in force for foodstuffs. This 1% threshold is provided for by the Council regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000. Above that 1% threshold, an indication of the presence of a genetic modification in a food is compulsory. As the recital of the regulation states, the 1% value best serves the purpose of establishing a tolerance level which simultaneously remains low and takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain. All these factors along the production chain are involved. The seeds thresholds are based on this 1% threshold. You have to count backwards in order to reach this 1% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">A recital of the draft Commission directive on seeds provides that, should the food threshold change, the thresholds for seeds would need to be reconsidered accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the coexistence issue, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies is carrying out a study entitled 'Scenarios for Coexistence of Genetically Modified, Conventional and Organic Crops in European Agriculture', commissioned by the Agriculture Directorate-General and coordinated by the Joint Research Centre. The main aim of the study is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence. The study aimed to identify the source and estimated levels of adventitious presence of GM crops in non-GM crops at farm level, identify and assess changes in farming practices that could reduce adventitious presence below policy relevant thresholds and estimate the costs of relevant changes in farming practices, monitoring systems and potential insurance systems. The study confirms that cross-pollination and coexistence are issues that need to be considered in relation to agricultural production in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the study need to be interpreted with caution. Only three crops were analysed: oilseed rape for seed production, maize for feed use and potatoes for human consumption. The results are derived from models and have not been validated by real field data. Therefore this study provided preliminary conclusions but the hypothetical results need to be confirmed and further research will be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is discussing this and coordinating with the various directorate-generals. This debate will certainly continue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very complex and sensitive issue, legally, technically and politically. As I said earlier, we readily admit that we do not have all the answers. However, what we can do – as we have done with other technologies – is to put in place a legal framework to deal with the potential benefits as well as the risks. That is what we have tried to do with the revised Directive 18/2001/EC, traceability and labelling. Consequently it will, for example, affect thresholds when it comes to seed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for this debate and I am sure we shall continue it at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
