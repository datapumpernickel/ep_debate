A date which many are looking forward to. But before we can open the champagne with peace of mind at the turn of the millennium, specific European action in the civil and military nuclear sectors is desperately needed. </p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union and the United States, the problems have been identified in good time. However, this has been the case to a lesser extent in Central and Eastern Europe. The millennium problem in the nuclear energy sector should primarily be tackled by the <span class="italic">International Atomic Energy Agency</span>. This UN organisation is the designated body for worldwide nuclear issues. However, the IAEA has indicated that it has no funding for specific support to solve problems in Central and Eastern European countries. The question remains as to whether these countries are themselves putting enough money into tackling the millennium bug. Russia, in particular, is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, Parliament quizzed the then Commissioner, Mr Van den Broek, concerning the EU’s role in this transnational problem. His reply was that the IAEA has drawn up an inventory of potential problems. I now have three questions for the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, does the Commission have the results of this inventory? If so, I would like to ask the Commissioner to provide an outline thereof. Secondly, is the Commission conducting negotiations with governments in Central and Eastern Europe? What concrete action has ensued therefrom? Thirdly, what is the cost involved to the European Union? I thank you and await your reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theorin (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, nuclear weapons are the weapons of the Cold War, but in spite of the fact that the Cold War is over, nuclear weapons are still there. Thousands of these weapons are to be found on aircraft, on aircraft carriers and on land, ready for firing, despite the fact that there are no threats to use nuclear weapons. To have nuclear weapons ready for immediate firing is a very dangerous situation, mainly because nuclear weapons can be released by mistake. This has come close to happening on a number of occasions. As recently as 1995, the Russians mistook a Norwegian test rocket for American nuclear weapons and went onto a full-scale war footing in Russia. Mr Yeltsin had to be woken up in the middle of the night but, very fortunately, the mistake was discovered before he decided to fire any nuclear weapons. </p>
<p class="contents">The risk of nuclear war by mistake was one of the reasons for the Canberra Commission’s proposal that no nuclear weapons should any longer be held in readiness for firing. This view was promoted in particular by the man formerly responsible for the United States’ strategic nuclear weapons, General Lee Butler, who himself literally had his finger on the nuclear button for many years. He knew how near we had been to unleashing a nuclear war by mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The second demand we made in order to reduce the risk of nuclear war was to the effect that all nuclear weapons should be separated from their weapon carriers so that sufficient time might be made for serious political deliberations. These two demands ought to be put into effect immediately. The reasons are that computer errors in nuclear weapons systems precisely at the turn of the millennium can by mistake lead to nuclear war. The early warning systems, which consist of a complex network of satellites, infra-red detectors and horizontal radar rely mainly upon the commercial electricity network. Even if the Pentagon has double-checked millions of computer components, full safety cannot be guaranteed; nor can it be guaranteed in Russia. Because of these serious defects in its early warning system, Russia cannot detect American intercontinental missiles for a period of three hours per day.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power too relies upon the commercial electricity network in order, for example, to maintain the supply of cooling water and to cool down the radioactive core and the spent nuclear fuel. If only a part of this protective network is knocked out because of computer errors, an estimated 100 metric tons of heavy uranium core in the reactor will melt down within two hours if the two reserve diesel generators do not function. Unfortunately, these reserve diesel generators are only 85 per cent reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">What must happen now is for the world’s nuclear powers no longer to have their nuclear weapons primed for firing and for them to separate the warheads from the weapon carriers, at least for the period of the turn of the millennium. Great Britain has already taken the decision to do this. Nuclear power stations too must be temporarily closed down or supplied with protective mechanisms at the turn of the millennium. It is this with which the resolution is concerned. A decision no longer to have any nuclear weapons primed for firing and to remove their warheads (that is to say, to separate the nuclear weapons from the weapon carriers) may at the same time be the beginning of serious nuclear disarmament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this resolution is not sufficient to do justice to all the important aspects of this subject. For this reason, I would mention three points in particular that are of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Japanese government has called on the people to stockpile purchases. That shows that the risk associated with the millennium bug is incalculable, and that also applies to Europe of course. It is a matter of great urgency that instructions be issued on how to act and that we discuss what could happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, where is the reply from the EU to the desperate call for help from 27 African states on 21 October this year? They are also asking the industrialised countries for help in overcoming their Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: The main question is, however, where did they get this problem from? This not only applies to Africa but to other countries in the “developing” world. In all analyses of and discussions on this subject, the developing countries do not play a part. But in fact they will be the hardest hit by the change in the date because they have been given old computers from the rich Northern countries that are not year 2000 compliant. The serious effect of this will be that food supplies will not be guaranteed and the internal stability of many countries will be threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">43 days before the turn of the century and we are still far from a solution to this problem. Here we see the dark side of the so-called global village of information technology. Old computers are handed over, along with responsibility. I expect rapid action. That not only applies to the Y2K problem, because the next problem is almost upon us. Many computers have not stored the date of 29 February in the year 2000. Everyone is talking about the Y2K problem, the millennium bug, but this problem is not being prepared for at all and it could have much more serious consequences as a result of nobody being prepared for it.</p>

<p class="contents">If, in the end, I have agreed to associate myself to the resolution to be put to the vote in this House, it is because I have been able to gauge the real feeling of some part of public opinion world-wide. These concerns, combined with the statements of our fellow Member on the subject of the reaction of the Japanese Government, and of other international bodies, inviting people to take precautions and to lay in stocks in expectation of the anticipated end of the world, have convinced me that the precautions advocated by this Parliament are, in their wisdom, likely to soothe fears and may therefore prove useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would not like to be in this building at midnight on 31 December – a mere 43 days from now. Lifts, fire alarms – what would work, if anything? There is a serious point to my jesting. We only have to think about it. This is a modern state-of-the-art multi-million plant.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland successive governments have expressed their concern to UK governments concerning the accident rate at the BNFL institutions, particularly the accident rate at Sellafield on the UK's least-populated west coast, only a few miles across from our most populated east coast. You may laugh, Mr President, but I am serious. It is not a major credible accident I have in mind and I do not mean to be alarmist. But I have to put on record my lack of confidence in the British nuclear industry's safety record. As a sovereign, non-nuclear nation, we in Ireland have a right to self-determination in terms of our people's health and environment. Consultation and communication between our two countries over the years regarding the British nuclear programme have not been good. A certain high-handed arrogance has been apparent despite public relations by Sellafield in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that all nuclear nations need to state clearly and honestly their programmes for Y2K date compliance, to assure their own and neighbouring nations of their readiness. Even at this late stage it is better we know the problems than adopt a head-in-the-sand approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will send a clear signal around the world about how seriously we take the Y2K issue, and it will hopefully act as an example for others to follow. Time, however, is clearly running out. That means however good intentions are now there is bound to be a risk of failures. In particular, the high level of computer interconnections between countries, particularly in the western world, makes it impossible to predict exactly what the failures might be and where they could occur. The higher the level of integration, the higher the level of unpredictability.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Eastern Europe is also far from reassuring. The lack of information coming from there worried the Commission as late as June this year, and the further east you go, the more worrying the situation gets. The safest approach is to turn off these plants at the millennium, but how does Lithuania turn off 75% of its generation capacity from Ignalia? By leaving people in the dark without water? The West must offer assistance, so I particularly welcome this resolution's call on OECD countries to provide resources for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish very quickly with an anecdote that would be funny if were it not so serious. The US and the Russians recently set up some hotlines them so they could liaise together over Y2K problems, and in all but one of the seven hotlines they set up, they discovered Y2K problems! Nothing will be certain in the weeks ahead, we must act now to reduce the risks around the world and I welcome the contribution this resolution will make to the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The way we see the situation in the Member States, the nuclear candidate countries with nuclear facilities and in the newly independent states is as follows. Let me first point out that very few nuclear power plants do in fact use a computer-based system for the essential part of their safety system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States which have nuclear power plants have been working on this question for at least two years, and the information in our possession indicates that the necessary corrective measures have by now been practically completed, as have all works to do with emergency planning. In this matter, the Commission has promoted exchanges of know-how and of good practice, but we did not consider it useful to intervene further with our activities in the actions of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The case is rather different for some countries of Central and Eastern Europe and some new Independent States, whose response to the problem has been less prompt. Some of them, in fact, did not start to concern themselves with this problem until the end of 1998. These countries have been supported in their work by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which reviewed their analyses of the extent of the problem in the cases of a considerable number of power plants. Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel referred to the operations carried out to date, and my answer to her is this: the operations of the Agency and of countries using nuclear power plants did not reveal any “bug” problems in the essential safety systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission provided additional assistance to a number of nuclear power plant operators. We financed European Union expert missions to 3 power plants in Russia and to 3 power plants in Ukraine. In addition, we offered our assistance to the nuclear regulation authorities as of the beginning of this year, and we are now supporting projects of this type in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Although none of the elements in the crucial safety systems are affected, a number of other systems, particularly the operator display systems, may be affected and failure of these systems may indirectly threaten nuclear safety by increasing the burden on the operators, as has been mentioned. According to the information available to us, we think that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have generally made good progress in correcting these systems. In comparison, the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union are making undeniably slower progress in their corrective operations, but they are all claiming that the work will have been completed by the end of the year. We are supporting these rehabilitation projects by contributing to the activities of two international scientific and technical centres, in Moscow and Kiev, and we are prepared, if necessary, to provide additional assistance to these programmes in consideration of the fact that, as you have said throughout this debate, we are getting extremely close to the transition to the year 2000 and the main thing has been to begin to address the problem in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my answer, and this is our contribution to solving this important problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
