<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, Honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking you, Prime Minister, for your opening address, which set out your vision for a responsible, dynamic, green and safe Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, when we met in Brussels soon after your election in October last year, I told you of my conviction that Denmark would make a decisive contribution to our common European project. Having listened to you today, and to your inspiring remarks about your sincere commitment to European values and the Community method, I am even more convinced of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we are all aware of the harsh economic realities in today’s European Union. In October last year, the Commission presented a five-point road map to stability and growth. We said we needed to work, at the same time, to give a decisive response to the problems in Greece; to enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis; to strengthen the banking system, namely through recapitalisation; to frontload stability and growth-enhancing policies; and to build more robust and integrated economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: without implementation of a credible response to the euro area crisis, our prospects for economic growth will not be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will urge the Member States to complete what is still pending in this road map – from a lasting solution for Greece to implementation of a credible system of firewalls. While we put these instruments in place, our response cannot be only about discipline and sanctions. Yes, discipline is needed but we also need convergence. Yes, stability is indispensable, but we also need growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and growth. More and more, our partners and international investors are asking the following question: what is Europe’s medium-term and long-term prospect for growth? It is clear that we will not overcome this crisis without a credible response to the question of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been saying for years what needs to be done, but – let us be frank – action by the Member States has been uneven and in many cases insufficient. If we are serious about overcoming the crisis, we must be serious about adding decisive action on growth to the decisive action already under way on financial and fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p class="contents">So where is the growth going to come from? Since there is reduced fiscal space in most of our Member States, it will come mainly from delivering structural reforms, increasing our competitiveness and targeted investment. We must deepen the internal market; invest in priority projects, namely in innovation; get the best possible effect from funds not yet spent; and gain market access in fast-growing economies outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the real economy and just consider, as an illustration, the following point. We have roughly 23 million people unemployed across Europe. We also have around 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises. If we create the right conditions for each SME, on average, to create one job, we could succeed in our fight against unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">So the answer for growth lies in our enterprises, including our small and medium-sized companies. The way to reach this goal is by having more flexible and competitive markets, less red tape and better access to finance. These are the problems that our companies, in many of our Member States, face today: they do not have access to finance. We have tabled proposals to use the Structural Funds as guarantees to finance SMEs, and also proposals for venture capital. I hope there will be swift progress with these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made concrete proposals to tackle youth unemployment – one of the greatest challenges we have today in Europe. We have proposed the Youth Opportunities Initiative. I hope that the informal European Council on 30 January will agree to move these concrete proposals forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Social justice is also part of the solution. Social justice is also a central element of our growth strategy because the sacrifices must be fairly distributed throughout society. Our crisis response is not credible without this element of social justice. I believe that social dialogue is crucial in this regard and I will meet with the social partners next Monday in Brussels. I hope the same approach is followed in all our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, growth in Europe must come from deepening our single market. We should release its full potential, namely through the adoption of key measures such as the framework for venture capital, updated procurement rules and a better framework for online commerce and e-payments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also urgently reach agreement on the European patent. We have been discussing this for decades. I fully expect negotiations on this to be completed early in the Danish Presidency. I call on the three Member States – France, Germany and the United Kingdom – who are holding things up over a side issue of some offices swiftly to find a compromise. Frankly it is not acceptable that such a crucial initiative is blocked over such a trivial disagreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to innovate in order to grow, and innovation is severely hampered by the current complex and expensive rules that we have been trying to overcome for decades. It is now time to make history and to score a victory for ambition, for common sense and, above all, for Europe’s innovators.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the measures we need are already on the table in the Europe 2020 growth strategy. There will be no resolution to this crisis unless we get serious about implementing them. We have to be consistent, persevering and determined over time. The Europe 2020 strategy is not a strategy that can wait until 2020. It needs action now, and central to the strategy is sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We share with Denmark the priority given to green growth. The Commission looks to the Danish Presidency to conclude negotiations on the energy efficiency directive that we proposed in June last year, and to move forward with the low-carbon energy road map for 2050 that we presented in December.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency will also oversee the second European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination. This will be the first European semester to be implemented within our new system of economic governance. We must build on the experience of the first semester to show that we are serious about the need to reform, and ready to take full account of the deep interdependence of our economies. The Commission brought forward the publication of this year’s Annual Growth Survey to allow plenty of time for the European Parliament and the Council to examine the priorities we have identified before the spring European Council. It is critical to ensure that the intelligent fiscal consolidation, growth-boosting measures and structural reforms recommended in the survey are pursued in a determined manner across the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The governance aspects of the economic agenda are also likely to retain a high profile. We expect to conclude the negotiations on the new ‘fiscal compact’, discussed at the European Council last December. I am convinced that the Danish Presidency will play a constructive role as a bridge between the countries that are inside and those outside the euro area. The Commission looks to the Danish Presidency to uphold not only the principles of unity between all Member States but also the legitimate role of the European Union institutions in the negotiations on this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also be charged with pushing forward the two new proposals on strengthened economic governance for the euro area, proposals the Commission put forward in November under Article 136 of the Treaty. These build on what was already agreed in the ‘six-pack’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency will also be leading negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, which will be a key engine for growth and job creation in Europe over the coming years. These discussions will not be easy in the current climate, but I believe that the proposals on the table are balanced and at the same time ambitious and realistic. I am confident that you will support the Commission’s efforts to simplify the budget and to focus every euro on delivering tangible, concrete results for Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying a few words about our ambitions for an open and safe Europe. The European Union is today a very different place from 10 years ago when Denmark last held the Presidency. At that time – and I remember well that I participated, as Prime Minister of my country, in that historic European Council in Copenhagen – Denmark chaired the negotiations that enabled 10 new Member States to join the European Union. Denmark has, in that way, shown its very significant commitment to openness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports a strengthening of Europe’s voice on the global stage and the role of the High Representative and the External Action Service. I also expect Europe to play a key role in the Rio+20 negotiations, confirming our leadership role on matters of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Presidency’s intention to strengthen the Schengen agreement and the common asylum system. In particular I would like to underline here my sincere appreciation of the decision taken by the Prime Minister and the new Danish Government’s commitment to full respect for the principle of free movement in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, allow me to state that, in challenging times such as these, I am sure that the European Union will benefit from Denmark’s progressive and innovative attitude more than ever before. The challenges are great and the programme is extensive but, with the right responsible approach and with the support of the other European institutions, I am sure the Danish Presidency will achieve its goals. Prime Minister, I wish you the greatest of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors.</p>
<p class="contents">The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you all the best for the next six months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware of your great tolerance in relation to speaking time. This tolerance is something you inherited from your predecessor and I would like to thank you for it before I begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, this debate about Europe is being conducted against the backdrop of a difficult situation, Let us be honest: many of those who arguably have more say in determining the fate of Europe than we do in Parliament are not in fact here. I am referring to the financial markets and rating agencies. It is completely unacceptable that we should so often find ourselves the victims of the capricious enforcers of financial market developments and the ratings agencies. They are simply exploiting the weakness of Europe. The weakness of Europe is that to date we have failed to find a joint solution or have only succeeded in finding certain solutions with difficulty. This is something that the rating agencies prove to us on a daily basis: if we do not have joint solutions, then we will find ourselves making it up as we go along, which is no way to manage European policy. That is why I support everything that has already been said, including in relation to the Community method. Prime Minister, you underlined this correctly. As you rightly said, it is important that we should move away from a one-sided policy of austerity. The rating agencies leave us in no doubt here either in their most recent downgrades: a one-sided policy of austerity will not really allow the budgets to be corrected. Should we not be concerned when the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> – let me emphasise: the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, a publication not known for its left-wing views – writes as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‘The conclusion of the fiscal treaty, which is the top priority of EU politics right now, is at best an irrelevant distraction.’ An irrelevant distraction. </p>
<p class="contents">This really does give us food for thought. It is, however, the social problems that are the consequence of this irrelevant distraction.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, you said it yourself: let us look at Romania’s current position. What has happened there shows that unsocial austerity policies do not work. As you quite rightly said, it is important that savings should be made. However, this cannot be at the expense of the poorest members of society. That is exactly what is happening in Romania today.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only urge everyone to find a way back from the brink and to reinstate the primacy of the social state in Europe. Without a social state we will never get control of budgetary problems. I am not arguing against reforms, which are necessary here and there. I am arguing against the questioning of the fundamental principles of the social state we are witnessing today, however. That is when social unrest occurs, when we have massive restrictions on civil rights and when the police are the dominant power on the streets. Events in Bucharest and in other cities should really give us plenty to think about.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the education sector. The story is the same here. We recently put our weight behind the Lisbon Programme: our aim is to be the most competition-oriented and most competitive region, specifically on the basis of our education, training, science and research. What do we see happening today? Resources are being cut. Not only are they not being increased, they are actually being cut. I believe that this is extremely damaging. When you referred to the ‘no future’ generation, you should know that it has already arrived. In your programme you rightly said that we need Europe to be at work. Unfortunately, what we often witness today is a Europe of rising unemployment. Let me make an admission: my group wants to see Europe at work. We fully support your approach. This can only happen – and I would like to make this quite clear – if we link environmental concerns, the workforce and employment policy. We are absolutely against viewing these as opposites.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why we shall work with all the stakeholders – including the unions – to ensure that new jobs are created, that the environment is protected and that sustainable development is guaranteed. The Danish Presidency has our unconditional support in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned energy efficiency. This again is an issue close to our hearts. We must become more energy-efficient. This is something we can achieve. There are plenty of good examples, we simply need to follow them. I believe that the most important thing here is that our pride should be restored. Europeans must be able to take pride in Europe. We are confronted with our problems when we travel to the US or China, for example. Things were quite different 10 years ago. I would like things to be different again after the Danish Presidency and would hope that we can once again take pride in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a short comment – after all I do not wish to stretch the patience of our new President. Before my election, our group had some exemplary debates in the most positive sense. I should also like officially to thank my fellow Members, particularly Catherine Trautmann and Stephen Hughes. We are here today as a cohesive group. We remain a cohesive, able partner for our colleagues in this House and, of course, for the Presidency and for the European Commission. We all have different expectations from Europe: a social Europe, a fair Europe, a green Europe. Above all – as we shall discuss this afternoon – we want a democratic Europe. Democracy must prevail in all of our Member States. We are ready to talk, however. We aim to work together to create this Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind I would like to congratulate you once again, Mr President, as well as all the Vice-Presidents. I believe we have made some excellent appointments to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. –</span> Mr President, I think that the Prime Minister has one priority, namely to find a way out of the two crises we are going through at the moment – the euro crisis, and the crisis concerning European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that one thing is crystal clear: the half-measures that have been taken over the last two years have not worked, and all the bilateral meetings between Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have not worked either. They only calm the markets for 24 hours, and then everything starts again. We have to say, as has already been mentioned here, that the recent decision of Standard and Poor’s has been attacked by all – or perhaps I should say most – European leaders. I am not a big fan of the rating agency either, but I think that, instead of complaining about them, the European leaders today should read their reports and the message they are giving, because what they are saying is in fact true.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed that Mr Barnier, Mr Rehn and others reacted in that way because when you see – and when you read – what Standard and Poor’s is saying, it is true. They describe the lack of political courage and unity in Europe as the main problems at the moment. They describe the misinterpretation of the crisis. They are saying that it is not only a financial crisis – a fiscal crisis – but also a trade imbalance crisis. They describe the need – maybe it was the Socialists who wrote this – to help countries that are cutting their expenditure to achieve some growth too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the applause for Standard and Poor’s. So they are right that the crisis is far from over and that we still need a sustainable solution. Let us be honest about this. The solution is not on the table for the moment. What we need are stability bonds, common bonds – choose whatever name you want. The German proposal for a redemption fund is also a very good idea. But if you want this crisis to be over, you have to act now.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not just my opinion, or our opinion here; it is also the message from Italy’s Prime Minister, Mario Monti, in today’s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>. He says that he is not complaining about the downgrading of the ratings: the problem is the persistent policy weakness at European level. He also says that he does not just need a pat on the back from Mrs Merkel, but a commitment regarding Eurobonds and the Eurobond market. He is right. There is no sustainable solution for Italy with today’s interest rates of six or seven percent. The only way that he can come out of this crisis is to continue with his economies and savings, but at the same time we must lower those six or seven percent interest rates on the Eurobond market. Otherwise we are asking an impossible task of Mr Monti. It is not fair to say that it is very good to continue with your austerity programmes and at the same time to continue having interest rates of six or seven percent.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, Prime Minister, is that you have another crisis to tackle: the crisis concerning our values. Not just in Hungary: look also at what is happening in Romania today. I know that the Commission has started a number of infringement procedures. I hope that we will find a majority here in Parliament to launch the procedure based on Article 7 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, Mr President, congratulations. You will give me more time now, will you not? You are an Italian, you do that in Italy. My final question to you, Prime Minister, is very clear. The Commission is starting infringement procedures. We should be starting a procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty. My question is, what will the Council be doing over the coming days? Will you, Prime Minister, put it on the agenda of the next European Council? I think it would be a mistake if you do not do so. The core of Europe is not only about money and about the euro, but also about our liberties and our values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will no doubt be aware of the reputation that precedes you. Because you represent a red-red-green government in Denmark, my group naturally has very particular expectations from you, not just because of your political background and this refreshing new start for Denmark, but also because, with your decisively female Scandinavian way, you represent a new force in the urgent debate concerning Europe. I could imagine your charmingly sober approach to politics, which I noted in Copenhagen, is also an instrument that you could use to challenge your German opposite number in the context of crisis politics. That is precisely what we expect from you. We expect you to take another critical look at the Treaty we have been debating since the last crisis summit. We believe that this Treaty is not just a diversion from crisis politics, but also an insult to European democracy. It not only excludes the European Parliament, but also fails to take national parliaments sufficiently into account. This is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that, for example, the European summits that are now to take place in an informal way in the future, will be difficult from Denmark’s perspective because they shift the balance of power in the Council in an unwelcome way. So much for these difficult treaty-related technical issues. I believe that such democratic questions are of enormous significance for the continued functioning of the European Union. The substance of this Treaty has been rightly criticised by the previous speakers in this House. The completely one-sided focus on stability has not only failed to resolve the crisis, but actually made it worse and I now find it almost unbearable to hear in each plenary how we are even deeper in crisis than before the last crisis summit.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning the World Bank hit the headlines with the news that it remains of the view that Europe is collapsing into crisis and will drag the rest of the world with it. How long can this go on?</p>
<p class="contents">Your programme contains some elements that indicate that you want to do things differently in your capacity as the Danish President-in-Office of the Council. Go ahead. Do not wait until halfway through your Council Presidency, but rather start the debate right now. We need these investment programmes to help the economy recover now. Your ideas on climate protection, which were very well prepared by Connie Hedegaard, and your ideas on energy efficiency, could provide the stimulus for jobs in the European Union. You have no time to lose, however.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard mention several times today of the construction of the entire financial market regulatory system. I fully agree that we must discuss the question of Eurobonds or the Redemption Fund and that this is an issue that can no longer be put off.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a word on the role of the European Central Bank in this debate: it is still a huge problem that we believe that we can have a common currency and that we can defend it without having a truly jointly functioning European Central Bank or without authorising the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). This message has also been repeated like a mantra by many speakers. It has been picked up and developed by the rating agencies but has not had sufficient effect in the Council or in the key Member States to date.</p>
<p class="contents">My plea to you, as a former colleague, as Prime Minister and as President-in-Office of the Council, is as follows: as a woman, do things better than your predecessors. Do not procrastinate, but follow your political convictions in the Council. Hungary, which is the subject of this afternoon’s debate, is an excellent example of how the Council and Commission have allowed a problem to fester, deflecting attention from it, and are now having to pay the price for the way in which the country has developed. The Commission and Council share responsibility for what happened in Hungary during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council.</p>

Viktor Orbán’s government has not succeeded in finding a way out of Hungary’s difficult economic situation.

I believe that we should show solidarity with the Hungarians and with all other European Member States who are experiencing economic problems. I also believe, however, that solidarity is not something that can be ordered à la carte. All values apply equally within the European Union, not just solidarity, allowing the rest to be forgotten as Mr Orbán’s government currently wishes.</p>

The Presidency has begun well with its frank assessment of the damage that a financial transaction tax would cause to the gross domestic product of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Presidency will continue in this vein and tell all the leaders of the European Union that the time has come to face the truth about the eurozone and about Europe’s fundamental economic weaknesses, because the last Council was a staggering missed opportunity. Instead of facing reality, instead of tackling these problems, the Council has embarked on yet another round of introspective, institutional navel-gazing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never forget that we are currently in the midst of not one but two great crises. The eurozone is the most immediate problem, but we must also not lose sight of the fact that Europe faces a fundamental challenge to its international economic position. We are losing competitiveness in the global marketplace; we are falling behind more dynamic regions of the world. We are allowing bureaucracy to stifle enterprise and regulation to hamper innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">As we work towards Europe in 2020 we need a growth agenda which creates jobs and which encourages businesses. The European Union must focus on stimulating economic reform and developing the single market. We therefore support some of the key priorities of the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Multiannual Financial Framework, we welcome the fact that it should be viewed in the context of needing to consolidate public finances. A budget that looks to the future, and not to the past, and a budget that strives for cost-effectiveness – as suggested in the programme – is very welcome from our point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We need all Member States to take a similarly realistic, unrestrained view of the EU budget. We would like a budget freeze, and we want the focus on spending existing resources more efficiently and more effectively. We also look forward to the efforts of the Presidency to emphasise the need to revitalise the single market, because we share the vision of Europe as an open region for trade, an open region for investments. Economic openness is also a precondition for increased growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the programme seems to use the language of the 21st century to describe tried and failed policies of the 20th century. The Presidency programme speaks of more regulation, it speaks of a responsible economy, and it speaks of effective standardisation. All of us, politicians and officials, need to remember that every additional regulation comes at a cost. This must be paid for either by consumers when buying the goods or services or by workers who lose their jobs as employment is exported overseas.</p>
<p class="contents">There are aspects of the programme that we would deplore; we are alarmed by some of the thinking behind initiatives in the field of external relations and in the field of justice and home affairs. The Presidency should not, for instance, promote the Commission’s proposal for a common corporate tax base. It should have the courage to try and kill off such an ill-conceived and dangerous proposal. With that, let me wish the Danish Presidency well and we look forward to working constructively with them to advance the cause that we all believe in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations on having just passed your first 100 days in power as the new government in Denmark. At the elections in September, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her allies put a clear question to the Danish people: are we to get ourselves out of the crisis by investing or by saving? Are we to overcome the crisis by creating jobs or by creating unemployment?</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish people gave their answer by electing Ms Thorning-Schmidt as Prime Minister. The question that the Danish Prime Minister asked during the Danish elections is even more relevant in the EU as a whole because, as has already been said, the EU is experiencing the deepest crisis that it has ever faced. More than 10% of our citizens in the European Union are unemployed, with 5 million in Spain alone – which is more than the entire Danish population – and youth unemployment is catastrophic. Two thirds of EU Member States have a youth unemployment rate above 20% – in Lithuania it is over 30%, in Greece over 40% and in Spain almost 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is also disappointing to read the programme of the Danish Presidency. It could almost have been written by ‘Merkozy’. Gone are the ideas of investing our way out of the crisis and back are the demands for savings to get us out of the crisis. Honestly speaking, however, is there anyone who believes that we can overcome the current crisis by ordering cuts and reductions? The EU tried this in Greece. It did not work. The EU tried again in Greece. Still it did not work. Now we are trying for a third time in Greece, and it will still not work!</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency’s programme bears the grand title ‘Europe at work’, but the policy that is presented will lead to more unemployment. My group believes that this is completely the wrong approach to take. I would like to finish by saying to the Danish Presidency that people in the Member States do not need more cuts dictated by Europe. They do not need euro pacts or financial treaties to reduce public services and cut wages. People in Europe need jobs to improve their shared prosperity. The Danish Presidency has six months to show us that it is part of the solution and not part of the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that Ms Thorning-Schmidt is exactly the sort of Prime Minister that you are all longing for. She was educated at the bureaucratic academy that is the College of Europe in Bruges, taught and trained here in the European Parliament’s sacred halls and came to power purely on the basis of a whole string of lies told to her electorate in exactly the same way as the whole of the EU was established. That is certainly a President-in-Office of the Council that you can be proud of and that you will be able to embrace. I can promise you and everyone in the Commission that you will also be infatuated with Ms Thorning-Schmidt. You are yourselves the epitome of people who rule and govern without a popular mandate, without so much as a single voter ever having voted for you.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when more and more Danish voters are angry that they voted for Ms Thorning-Schmidt and would like to change what they did, you are certainly a model for this government, a perfect match. Where you needed to appoint puppet governments in Greece and Italy to do your bidding, Ms Thorning-Schmidt and the Danish Government will deliver everything on a silver platter. There will be no protests, no conflicts, only loyalty. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, therefore, I just have one friendly, but heartfelt, appeal to make to Ms Thorning-Schmidt: come to Brussels, come to Strasbourg, spend all of your time over the next six months here in the EU institutions. I say this primarily because it will prevent your government from destroying conditions in Denmark, but then also because the damaging of effect of you being here will be minimal in relation to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is already a supertanker with a leak. The water has already covered the lowest decks. The other day we saw how even the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is the instrument that is intended to rescue the whole of the euro area, was downgraded by the international credit rating agencies. Yet what is the tune that we hear being played? It is more violin playing, of course, just like on the Titanic as the water rushed in.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Thorning-Schmidt, welcome to the EU. Here you can get what you want. Your friends Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso and Mr Schulz are all here. Here you can mould the state that you want, but that no one else outside these walls wants. Here you decide, not the electorate. What you might have to lie about to get in Denmark, they get served on a silver platter here. This is a love story that is worth following.</p>

Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, I am afraid I have never in my life before heard quite so much hollow rhetoric and empty words as I have heard from you today. You seem similar to Mr Barroso, in this respect. What you said was meaningless, from start to finish, just like the stuff we are used to hearing from the Commission and Mr Barroso. Europe has been promising economic growth for fifteen years already, has it not? The Lisbon Strategy promises that Europe will be the strongest economy in the world, but what a joke that has turned out to be. In reality, European socialism has resulted in mass unemployment, bankrupt countries, economic decline and politicians who are only out to fill their own pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I wish to make an urgent appeal to you, because the Netherlands has a big problem with Europe. The Netherlands has one of the best social systems in the world and we are proud of that and, yet, Europe, European bureaucracy is working to destroy the Dutch system. What I mean is that it is unacceptable that European migrant workers should have the right to benefit from social services after spending only <span class="italic">one</span> year in their host country. You should have to spend at least ten years in a country before being able to avail yourself of its social services. But Europe prohibits us from imposing that condition. It is very important that the Netherlands is given scope to protect itself from all those Romanian and Bulgarian fortune hunters and keep them out of our social system, so that it can continue to exist for the benefit of Dutch people. Would you, therefore, put that at the top of your agenda, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been looking forward to the Danish Presidency and we hope that it goes well. There are a few of us who will give it our support. Even though there have been a few speakers in a row who were not entirely satisfied, I believe that most of us here in this Chamber would agree with the Danish Presidency on the four priorities that it has set out.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a major and obligatory task in the economic sphere with the fiscal compact, the ‘six-pack’ and, in particular, with the forthcoming budget. I do not believe that Denmark should be content to just run the office over the next six months. It is important for the whole of Europe that we have a Presidency with aspirations, a courageous Presidency that has the courage to set an agenda that can make a difference – even if this causes disagreement. Once the economic agenda is on track, I would like to see Denmark get to grips with the energy sector. There will be disagreement here, it is said, but it is essential that we find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2011, the EU spent EUR 315 billion buying in oil for Europe, and by focusing on energy efficiency we can save a great deal of money, which can then remain within the sector. Unfortunately, we see that Europe’s enterprises and citizens are currently becoming more and more dependent on gas from Mr Putin and oil from the Middle East. If we have a more stringent directive in the area of energy efficiency, we will increase Europe’s competitiveness, our innovation and, in particular, our capacity to operate on the global markets. Last but not least, it will create a huge number of jobs for blue-collar workers – we will create the growth that we so desperately want in Europe. If there is one area in which Denmark ought to achieve its objectives in the next six months, this is it. I hope that the Presidency will take up the fight, despite the fact that there are some people who disagree. I would like to wish you luck with the Presidency and with producing sound results that will ensure green growth and green research in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The four main headings – a responsible Europe, a dynamic Europe, a safe Europe and a green Europe – set a course for the EU that is absolutely the right one at this time. I believe that many Europeans feel that the EU is a bit remote, that it is something vague that goes on in Strasbourg and Brussels, but that perhaps does not have any great relevance to their everyday lives. The reality, however, is quite different. This could not be further from the truth. The decisions that are taken in these buildings have enormous consequences for people’s everyday lives from Amsterdam to Athens, from Cyprus to Copenhagen. When we talk about a responsible and dynamic Europe what we are talking about is the need to create growth and jobs, but we of course have to do so at a time that also demands frugality. This is a difficult balance to find. It is something quite different – in fact it is the complete opposite of what Mr Messerschmidt and Mr Søndergaard said. Mr Messerschmidt spoke of ‘the perfect match’ and ‘love affairs’ – in this regard, I have to say that the far left and the far right are united in their criticism of Europe and are sending out a message to the effect that countries, like Greece for example, that are not able to make cuts themselves should be left to their own devices. This is obviously something that has an impact, not because they are right, but because it shows how damaging it is if we do not stand together in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A green Europe is another vision. This is a vision that holds that, at a time of crisis, we must not neglect the environment – on the contrary in fact! By doing something good for the environment and for the climate we can also create jobs and growth. Take the Energy Efficiency Directive, for example. Here we say that if, in Europe, we reduce our CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions internally by 25% – we can do that by being 20% more energy efficient than we are today – we can create 2 million jobs. That means jobs for 2 million Europeans who do not currently have one. That is where we can make a difference. That is where we can make the EU visible. That is where we can demonstrate that when we stand together across borders we can make a difference for the better.</p>
<p class="contents">A safe Europe relates to the fact that cross-border crime and terrorism are things that cause concern and create insecurity. Here, too, we can make a difference if we work together across borders. Overall, this is a far-sighted, down-to-earth and very ambitious Presidency programme. I wish you every success.</p>

<p class="contents">Allow me to address the Prime Minister in English, as I intend to compliment her and her government, and the last time I complimented Commissioner Reding in this plenary, it was translated as criticism. Therefore, as the Prime Minister is not used to me complimenting her, I want to avoid any misunderstandings, because the message is also for this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to compliment the Danish Government on three things. I want to compliment you on having listened to this House in drawing up your priorities, and on sticking to what is already on the table. This makes for a Presidency programme which is ambitious yet pragmatic. It shows that you have clearly understood your role as an honest broker. And finally, you and your ministers have done your homework and have been extremely industrious, with a high number of preliminary talks with Parliament. Thank you for that. I am sure you will get the support you have asked for today.</p>
<p class="contents">But, before the Prime Minister gets carried away by all these compliments, I had better ask a few critical questions. Firstly, how will the Prime Minister navigate the emerging minefield of new intergovernmental agreements and avoid European disunity? Secondly, what is the Danish position on a ‘Tobin tax’, which – according to the Commission’s latest figures – could cost around 130 000 jobs? Lastly, we are currently discussing family reunification rules and the Commission’s Green Paper. Now that Parliament’s President, Mr Schulz, has withdrawn his earlier critique of the 24-year rule, will the Prime Minister seize this opportunity to start working for an EU-wide 24-year rule? Those are my questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, I wish you the best of luck in the Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by saying that I think it is refreshing to see a strong and visionary woman at the head of Europe, a Europe in which there are a great many dusty, grey suits. I think that we are in need of a breath of fresh air, and I believe that you are able to provide that. The most important thing as far as I am concerned is the fact that the Danish Presidency is to a large extent making it a priority to find a common European solution to the crisis. It involves focusing hard on creating green growth, sustainable growth and new green jobs. That is what millions of European citizens who are currently out of work need. My own generation, the young people in Europe, is the hardest hit, and I am pleased that you have taken up the question of solidarity between generations here today. I think the Danish Presidency could even go a step further and ensure that we set the halving of youth unemployment as a new 2020 objective and that we work towards providing a European youth guarantee to ensure jobs and education here during the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that it is vital for us all to recognise that cuts alone will not solve the crisis. Cuts have been on the agenda for a long time, and for a long time it has been about giving each other a haircut. Now it is time to kick start our economy, to create new jobs and to ensure that our crisis solutions are fair. Following your speech today, I have very high expectations that the Danish Presidency will succeed in this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are major challenges ahead of the Danish Presidency over the next six months. Among other things, it is expected that the Danish Presidency will focus on reforming the EU’s energy consumption. This is a huge challenge, as the Member States all have such different needs. I hope the Presidency will support the development of completely new renewable energy initiatives. Wind, water and solar energy are quite simply not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark has taken over the Presidency during a grim period. The economic crisis is having major consequences for the people of Europe, who are already being hit hard by unemployment, which is something we are hearing from all sides today, particularly among young people. We can change this if we strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are suffering very difficult conditions right now. As you said yourself, it is time to kick start growth. I do not expect the Presidency to spend time making amendments to the Treaties that do not have the support of the people. The crisis must not be used as an excuse for more EU bureaucracy. The time should instead be spent on tangible results, realism, increased competitiveness and strengthening the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important matters also need urgent attention, as we are hearing from our fellow Members. The reforms of the fisheries policy and agricultural policy are matters that are on the table right now. At a time of financial deficit and demands for national savings, it would be appropriate for the EU to demand one base for this Parliament and to make substantial cuts in both agricultural and fisheries subsidies. We know that, in their current form, these two areas do not work as they are supposed to, but they nevertheless cost citizens dearly. We need to stop paying for initiatives that do not have the desired effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear that the Presidency will work in a targeted and realistic way to enable European citizens to regain confidence in their future in our part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the Prime Minister and Mr Barroso spoke about growth but, when you read the programme, it is clear that what we have here is business as usual – talking about growth while implementing austerity – and there is obviously a particular emphasis within the programme on the implementation of economic governance. Economic governance pure and simple is a method of institutionalising austerity at the expense of democracy across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results; and that is precisely what we have here. Is it insanity or is it simply a means of ensuring that the bondholders get their pound of flesh at the expense of working people?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, can I ask about the attitude of the Danish Presidency and the Commission as to the prospect of a referendum in Ireland on the austerity treaty, which goes even further in institutionalising and enshrining austerity? Will you respect the legal and political right of the Irish people to a referendum and to vote freely without a campaign of fear or blackmail? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the energy sector, your Presidency could take the initiative of inventorising all existing energy sources in Europe. We need to know what energy sources the European Union has at its disposal and which of our investments in the energy sector are not realistic; for example, we have photovoltaics in countries where there is no sunshine. We therefore need to inventorise existing energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">My second proposal is that an initiative should be taken in the employment sector.

This is something quite new for us from a Danish perspective and we shall do all we can actively to support you in this programme, both in implementing the individual measures – for example in relation to the regulation of the financial markets – as well as your efforts to make the Community method a success as the yardstick for European policy, rather than the intergovernmental method – this is something you expressly emphasised.

Prime Minister, please do us a favour during your six months holding the Presidency and, in view of the forthcoming Presidency, persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Cyprus, which will hold the Presidency after you. This would be a real success in relation to Turkey. If Turkey intends to continue blocking Cyprus, then I would have to say in your six-month report that you perhaps did not manage to fully succeed in your mandate in this regard.

Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the Energy Efficiency Directive, I will try to move this Parliament into a position where we can reach a deal with you. Today, however, I want to address one issue which I think is crucial in relation to getting investment in the short term, and it concerns the European Investment Bank. In December 2008, 27 heads of state decided that in 2009 the lending capacity of the EIB should be raised from EUR 55 billion to EUR 80 billion. That meant in 2009 that there was EUR 25 billion more concrete investment in wind and other projects as well as corporate bonds, which saved part of the European car industry. Today we are in the same credit crunch, yet for next year the EIB has reduced its lending capacity to EUR 60 billion. Why, at this very moment, are we cutting back EUR 20 billion in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, why is the EIB not using what Mr Draghi has provided as a lifeline for the private banks? Private banks now have EUR 500 billion at 1%, and they are parking it overnight in the European Central Bank and not investing it in the real economy. So, why is the EIB not able to lend EUR 80 billion at 1% in 2012 and invest in the European economy? Is that not the single quickest investment stimulus we can get during your Presidency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rather than focusing on implementing measures to safeguard the future of 500 million citizens, the Danish government has promised to be a faithful guard-dog of the Council’s euro-technocracy. There are also other passages I also do not agree with.</p>

<p class="contents">What does this mean? In my view a more responsible Europe is first and foremost a Europe that is aware of the risk it is running. Today the biggest obstacle to this is the European leadership. It is not the euro that is in danger. In the euro area there are countries that have accepted the currency, but not the sense of political leadership. The worst situation is the immobility of our leadership in the continent. This is particularly true for countries in trouble that are in dire need of being driven by the force of the colossus that is Europe.</p>

I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth?</p>

<p class="contents">Presidents generally set so many priorities that, ultimately, nothing is a priority. The same applies to European years, which often vanish, with no traces of them remaining. At present, the Union is celebrating the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. This is also a particularly crucial issue from the point of view of the economy. Prolonging careers and safeguarding the durability of pension systems are issues of human dignity, but they are also very important matters for the economy. That is because it is an inescapable fact that ageism has now reached new levels in the European Union and in all the Member States, on account of this present economic recession. There are, of course, shining examples of active ageing in our midst: Jacques Delors, Helmut Schmidt and others. Make this a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to translate what my Socialist fellow Member was proposing: if you put Hungary in your sights, your programme will succeed. I, however, do not share this opinion. I am very pleased to see that your presidency programme reflects the same intention that the Hungarian Presidency had set as its objective just one year ago, namely the intention to create the second pillar of the economic union by coordinating economic policies on a Europe-wide scale. Well, now is your chance to launch this process in a responsible manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Hungarian MEP, I am perfectly aware what it is like to work with dedication towards common policies while being outside the euro area. A prominent part of your programme is the strict monitoring of every constituent of economic governance. This task does indeed call for a clear head and rational thinking, but above all else, it calls for considerate behaviour. It requires considerate behaviour primarily in that the realisation of these new mechanisms should not be viewed solely in terms of figures.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to look for similarities in Member States over the course of your work instead of seeking to separate them into well-performing and less well-performing countries, and to look for the efforts to which all Member States committed themselves upon their accession.

<p class="contents">As some of my friends told me, small countries can work miracles. So let us believe in this miracle. As usual the work of the Presidency is cut out. Why it is so difficult? Just a few reasons: we have to preserve the unity of Europe when the eurozone crisis is trying to tear us apart. We have to constantly fight against the extremists and the Eurosceptics, and let me underline that citizens are not happy about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to start to apply the ‘six-pack’ and take some painful decisions. There are serious doubts about the prevalence of democratic principles in some of the Member States, including a state I know well. However, I am not completely dejected. We have heard a coherent, elaborate Presidency programme for a responsible, dynamic green and safe Europe. As a mother of two, you place special attention on youth, as I do. I am, therefore, confident that the Commission will keep its determination to do this job, and make sure that our common European values are respected everywhere.</p>

If Europe is to be democratic, the European Parliament must be involved in every decision at a European level. During the Danish Presidency nothing must be decided without the participation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A responsible Europe must be united and not divided. Perhaps it is a good thing that you are not in the euro area, because there attempts are currently being made to separate some countries from the others. All the measures which are taken in response to the crisis must be community measures and must prepare for the next stage of integration, which involves establishing an economic and social union and a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area which you will be focusing on is regulating the financial markets. I would like to ask you to work together with us in Parliament to overcome the individual interests quickly and to implement the necessary measures to improve capital structure and liquidity while preserving the structure of the European economy.</p>

At a time when we risk a division in Europe in the process of deciding how to achieve financial stability, it is very important that the Presidency be able do whatever is needed in order to take care of the entire European Union and to bind Member States together. The process of the internal market, and of launching a new wave of reform for the internal market, is one of the most important ways of binding Europe together, and also of regaining economic strength and dynamism.

This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States.

They have not stopped but rather they have fuelled speculation against the euro. S&amp;P stressed that EU systemic tensions and euro problems were due to the growing divergence of competitiveness among core EU Member States and the so-called ‘periphery’. Solidarity has been an empty word in measures to counter these structural imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">The rating agencies have now come to agree with the progressive left that the punitive austerity obsessing Mrs Merkel’s government and other neo-liberal governments in Europe is not reducing debt anywhere but merely bringing recession, mass unemployment, fiscal and social injustice and rebellion to European streets.</p>
<p class="contents">A financial transaction tax is indeed a very good beginning but it is not enough. We absolutely need to move towards fiscal harmonisation. Take the case of Portugal, where 19 out of the 20 top stock-exchange-listed companies have moved fiscal domicile into the Netherlands and Luxembourg, not just to avoid paying higher taxes at home but to skip declaring the proceeds of investment in other world markets. How can they compete in this fiscal jungle in the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope we are going to get a change to the traditional diplomatic club in the Council, where none of the 27 call each other to account because of the ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine’ culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only six months remain for this to be done. Let us remind ourselves that a similar priority was found in the programmes of the Belgian, Hungarian and Polish Presidencies, not to mention the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">All the citizens of the European Union have an interest in this objective being achieved at last. Looking however at the efforts of previous presidencies and the continued accumulation of economic problems we can be almost certain that the next presidency is going to have to include a similar priority in its agenda. The Danish Presidency is also going to tackle the budget for 2014-2020. So it is extremely important that it maintain the very important Cohesion Fund, thanks to which the Union’s new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe can develop. In the point about a green Europe, Denmark assumes, on the one hand, sustainable economic growth, and, on the other hand, still wants to push through EU climate packages. In the opinion of many experts, these two courses of action are mutually exclusive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something we can be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one point that I would like to put to the Prime Minister. It concerns Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which relates to good administration. Citizens in Europe have been granted the right to good administration, and this in fact concerns the institutions here. Therefore it is something that should be taken seriously. However, if we do not have any proper legislation on good administration, the Commission will not employ it of its own free will. I have many reasons to believe that. Only if there is a push from a country holding the Presidency that for a long time has put transparency and citizen participation at the top of the agenda, only if there is a push from us will Article 41 be converted into good administration and there will be a chance that the Commission will take seriously the clear right that is now embodied in the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would strongly recommend that this matter also be taken up, because, although it might not be as glamorous as all the other matters, it is still very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the last six months, Parliament adopted a report on the fight against poverty. All of us here today are aware that the phenomenon is becoming increasingly serious in Europe with the different austerity measures in place in various Member States, whereby the report stated that such measures cannot undermine employment and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, what are the elements of the programme for your Presidency which will allow us to support Commissioner Andor in his efforts to meet the aim of reducing by 20 million the number of European people living in poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the budget seems particularly important. The report recommends – and I quote – ‘pressing ahead with, and providing increased funding for, European programmes which can contribute to various aspects of the fight against social exclusion and poverty’. How do you see this recommendation being implemented through negotiations on the future Multiannual Financial Framework?</p>
<p class="contents">Two subjects in particular will also come to the table: the establishment of a programme of food aid for the most deprived beyond 2013 and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

It has been a real pleasure to take part in this lively debate that we have had today.</p>
<p class="contents">What I take away from the debate today is a clear conviction that, yes, not all of us agree – I will come back to that – but also a solid and robust confirmation that we have support for the Danish Presidency programme and I thank you for that. We will do everything we can to live up to this support.</p>
<p class="contents">Many topics have been raised. Time is limited, but allow me to address a few of the issues that you have raised. Mr Barroso and Mr Daul raised the question of the MFF. We will be very serious in dealing with this during the Danish Presidency. I can assure you that it will be a top priority for the Danish Presidency to get as far as we can in terms of the Multiannual Financial Framework. We will do that with the purpose of modernising our financial perspective and in such a way that we can use our common resources to create new jobs and new growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context let me also make a remark on the financial transaction tax, which has been raised by Mr Callanan and others. I want to raise this to avoid any misunderstandings. The Danish Presidency will handle this dossier in a loyal and professional manner and as an honest broker. I am tempted also to draw attention to the wider agenda of the Financial Regulation, which we will intend to strengthen in our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have raised the question of Hungary, namely Mr Verhofstadt, Ms Harms and Mr Moraes. As everyone knows, there is a debate on Hungary taking place in the plenary later this afternoon. Let me be brief: the Commission plays a vital role as a guardian of our Treaties. They have found grounds for initiating an infringement procedure on at least three counts against Hungary. We must, of course, take that very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in full support of the way the Commission has handled this crisis. They have used what everyone is talking about today, the rules that we have, the Treaties and – let us be clear – the Community method. We are behind the Commission in this. All Member States are under the obligation to abide by our laws. That is an integral part of the way we do things in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have addressed the debt crisis. The downgrading of a number of European Member States underlines the need for European answers in this crisis but, before everyone decides that this is a crisis of Europe, I would like to remind this House that the reason why we have a debt crisis in the European Union is because Member States have not watched their own budgets. This is at the core of why we have a problem. We need to focus on European solutions, but let us not forget that the reason why we have an economic crisis is because the Member States did not abide by our rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This takes me to the downgrading of some of the Member States. Mr Verhofstadt referred to the wording and quoted, I believe, Standard and Poor’s. I have also noted what Standard and Poor’s are saying, because they were specifically referring to the lack of growth and employment perspectives in the European Member States when they downgraded the countries. What they said was not said by a Social Democrat or the European Left. Standard and Poor’s said that austerity also has to be followed up by growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the discussion about growth and employment. Many have touched upon that – Mr Swoboda, Ms Harms, Mr Søndergaard, Ms Turunen, Mr Bendtsen, Mr Johansson and many other speakers. Let me state very clearly that the European economies must consolidate. They need to do that and, for that reason, the Danish Presidency and Denmark will support the fiscal compact.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me also be very clear that it is not enough to focus on consolidation alone. We have to give a push in the right direction to growth and employment. Young people all across Europe are expecting that from us. We need to create European jobs now. I agree with the speakers who have suggested we go back to one of the biggest successes that the European Union have had over the years: the single market. It is the internal market that has created growth and employment. That is why we want to finalise the work of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the President of the European Council and I have agreed not to forget the issue of growth and employment. That is why we have agreed that at our meeting on 30 January 2012 we will emphasise this point and make sure that, not only do we discuss consolidation, but we also discuss growth and employment. This is what we want to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have mentioned the Energy Efficiency Directive. Mr Turmes mentioned this as rapporteur and I appreciate that. I can only repeat and stress to you that, if we want to see clear results on the green agenda, we must make haste. This is an opportunity. We have a European Parliament that wants to do that and we have a Presidency that wants to focus on that. Let us make it happen over the next six months. We can only do that if we all cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have addressed the question of European unity and the Community method: Mr Daul, Mr Rohde and others. Let me be clear, what sets Europe apart is our commitment to solidarity with each other, to our unity as a union, but also to our commitment to the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that if citizens across Europe are listening to this debate, they will look at us and ask what is this Community method? What do they mean by the Community method? I will state today that it is still worth defending because what the Community method really means is that Europe is no longer ruled by the strongest, but that Europe is now ruled by law and democracy. Friends, that is worth defending.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is worth defending not only for the smaller Member States but for all of us. The Community method and European unity must be an overarching goal for our endeavour. With your help, dear former colleagues, friends, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let us make it happen, let us work together and let us produce some tangible, real results for our European citizens. I am convinced that we can do that. If we do, we will also create a path out of the European crisis to a more prosperous future.</p>

Indeed, a number of challenges await Denmark, which are particularly important for the future of the European Union. These include the practical implementation of the European project for a reinforced economic union and further negotiations on the EU’s new Multiannual Financial Framework (2014-2020). Pushing these negotiations forward will be a major challenge for Denmark. Given that 2012 is the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, I am delighted that Denmark intends to focus on increasing employment among older people. I welcome the fact that by discussing not just current but future employment problems, in its programme Denmark is talking not only about older people but also about the young and their preparation for future labour market needs. Particular attention is also paid to reducing early school leaving. It is nevertheless disappointing that the Presidency’s programme fails to mention issues of major importance to people such as the Maternity Leave and Anti-Discrimination Directives that have been deadlocked for over a year. I have already consulted the Danish Presidency about the future of both legal acts, and about when the Member States are planning to reach a common solution in order to adopt these important Directives as soon as possible, therefore it would be very interesting to hear what specific actions the Presidency intends to take regarding these two issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, this has been one of the blows struck by the Treaty of Lisbon to the – never realised – principle of equality between the Member States of this EU. The programme of the Danish Presidency, as were the work of previous presidencies, is illustrative of who is in charge of the EU and determines its course: the Franco-German directorate, ever more dominated by Germany, which always acts in defence of its major companies and financial institutions. This is clear from reading this Presidency’s priorities, which include deepening the internal market by moving it into areas like public procurement, energy and knowledge, with the express intention of turning knowledge into a business; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the participation of older people in the labour market; and, of course, so-called austerity, in relation to which quick implementation of the decisions included in so-called economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact, and the most recent intergovernmental treaty – which seeks to enshrine austerity in constitutions and constitutes a dangerous attack on democracy – are advocated. These are policies of continuing with what has brought us to economic and social disaster; the splashes of green and socialism that the new Danish Government of the Social Democrats is seeking to give the programme are not enough to conceal them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Denmark is giving up its role as chair of the euro area stabilisation negotiations. On the one hand, this is understandable—it is not a member of the monetary union. Modesty on the part of the Danish representatives may, however, be unnecessary. The situation in the euro area affects the whole of Europe, and a neutral moderator of the negotiations would certainly be no bad thing. We must accept the decision, however, and focus on equally important points such as the efforts to restore economic growth and create jobs. I must nevertheless say that I was not pleased by all of the points in the Presidency programme. Although the text of the programme does not mention the financial transaction tax, the Danish minister for the economy has already stated that she does not support the tax. This is an especially unfortunate decision. Now is the time to take an unambiguous position in the area of regulation of the financial sector. Now is the time to make it clear who is responsible for the crisis and who is avoiding contributing to its costs. If, in the Presidency programme, there is a chapter ‘Responsible Europe’ with a subheading ‘Strengthened financial regulation and supervision’ but such an important proposal is missing, then it does not seem to me to be particularly credible. Despite that, I will keep my fingers crossed that my Danish colleagues see through this difficult period for the EU with honour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, seeing the energy with which your government is working, I am sure you will be able to complete it. At a time of crisis, Europe has to be dynamic and responsible. The decisions made at the European Council on 9 December 2011 must now be put into effect, to strengthen financial policy and secure economic stability in the Member States.

I hope that Denmark will pay special attention to the implementation of the European Roma strategy and the evaluation of the reports submitted under that strategy. I trust that Denmark will support the Schengen membership of Bulgaria and Romania, and will carry on with the enlargement process.

Notwithstanding the extreme economic situation, I hope that by the end of the six-month term of the Presidency we will see a stronger Europe. The Danish Presidency deserves special praise for keeping a clear head during the attacks levelled at Hungary. In doing so it also demonstrated that it supports a fair debate based on facts. Indeed, the Presidency recognised that it is the European idea which suffers the most from this hysterical series of attacks against Hungary. With their campaign of baseless accusations all that the left-wing political forces achieve is a Europe-wide strengthening of radical parties. I would also like to comment on the Presidency’s energy programme. I noted with satisfaction that besides short-term crisis management measures the development of a green economy and the implementation of a single energy market continue to be among the most important objectives. I hope that based on Denmark’s experience and expertise we will see significant progress in both areas over the course of the Presidency. One of the most significant reports of these six months will concern the Energy Efficiency Directive. An early conclusion of this matter is in the interest of us all. However, true success will only be achieved if the Directive sets out solutions that work in real life as well. High-sounding objectives have thus far often turned out to be failures. This time we must therefore take concrete steps towards the achievement of our 20% energy efficiency target. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Filling this post of extraordinary responsibility for the seventh time now, your country has exceptional experience in this field, which also represents a guarantee. As we know, Europe is going through a very difficult period, and it is perhaps more important than ever for the EU-27 that the new Presidency is successful. Reading through your programme I was satisfied to note that you intend to take your future measures with a view to ensuring a responsible, dynamic, green and safe Europe. I believe that these values serve the development of the entire European region. A more responsible economic policy, the preservation of economic stability, the enhancement of growth, job creation, a more efficient use of renewable energy sources, examination of the issues of asylum policy – and the list could go on – are all current and pressing matters these days. Allow me to also make a few remarks in my own field of expertise, which includes industry, research and energy. I have to agree with the position that we must work on creating a more effective internal energy policy which would result in intensified competition between supply companies, which in turn would reduce consumer prices. Furthermore, it is important for the EU to not be completely vulnerable to countries with immense raw material reserves. I am convinced that the key to Europe’s future success lies in research and development, the creation of new technologies, and their practical application. We must support all initiatives that serve the successful achievement of these goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis concerns not just the budgetary situation of the Member States, but is above all about the identity of the EU. We are facing a period in which the future of the united Europe will be decided. It is becoming increasingly evident that the new international agreement on strengthening economic union which is in preparation may lead not just to a deepening of the divide between the euro area and the other countries, but also to a weakening of the EU institutions. Therefore, the Danish Presidency should concentrate above all on defending the cohesion of the Union, its character as a community and the principles of solidarity. The fact that Copenhagen does not intend to adopt the common currency in the immediate future may be seen to be worrying. Furthermore, the previous government was a supporter of reducing the EU budget. However, I hope this will not affect the stance of our Danish friends. I am an optimist and I believe that during the Presidency they will be able to represent the interests of all the Member States. My optimism is based primarily on the memory of how superbly they coped with finalisation of the accession negotiations before what is known as the great enlargement. It seems, therefore, that at such a difficult moment the responsibility of holding the Presidency of the Council could not have fallen to a more suitable country. It is well known not only for its openness to the arguments of the other side and a culture of compromise, but also for its ability to make use of these qualities in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

True, several items in the programme have regional dimension. However, one expects a vision of the increasing role of the EU macro regional strategies, such as the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR). The Polish presidency has been active on this issue and its input requires continuation. The EUSBSR is a unique opportunity to implement plans for stronger Europe, concretely in the Baltic Sea region which is a dynamic area and least affected by current euro crisis. We expect from the Danish presidency a clear agenda and better coordination of the EUSBSR projects presented by eight member states around the Baltic Sea. I welcome Danish emphasis on creating a genuine digital single market. To boost cross-border business making, especially in e-commerce, one has to reduce decisively legislative and administrative barriers. This is a must if the EU is serious about reviving its economies and restoring its competitiveness on global markets. Lastly, cyber security is not once mentioned in the Danish programme. One looks forward to concrete plans on strengthening cyber security which is still lagging dramatically behind the technical development of threats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased, too, that the Danish Government is going to take up the issue of the European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation, which is intended to ensure among other things greater availability of microcredits in order to increase self-employment and the development of business, as well as greater freedom of movement when seeking work and the possibility of recruiting workers from all over Europe. I think an effective cohesion policy and an increase in employment levels are among key issues on the road to generating economic growth in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You must achieve as much progress as possible on the negotiations on the budget and important common European policies. The normal way to draft a budget is to identify the needs, assess the possibilities and then distribute resources. I have noticed that a different approach was adopted during the last conciliation proceedings for the annual budgets: the resources were determined and then distributed in a fairly random manner. I have understood that your proposal for tackling these negotiations is to go round gathering views on the size of national contributions at the end of January and to come back again to the proposals for the budgetary chapters, including for European policies, only in the course of the month. Although we are going through a financial crisis at the moment, I believe that this approach is not beneficial to the EU. If this information is true, I ask you to return and conduct the negotiations on the budget and European policies (CAP, cohesion, transport and research) as quickly as possible, simultaneously and in close connection with each other. Please do not forget that the Commission’s proposals on own resources must also be discussed in parallel. A possible agreement on own resources would ease the tension on the size of the national contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to ensure solidarity and growth, the Danish Government will have to cooperate not only with Member States and EU institutions, but also with civil society. I welcome that the areas being dealt with by the Danish Presidency are crucial to the future of the EU as a whole: economic recovery and budgetary discipline, energy efficiency and job creation in a competitive economy and a secure, powerful Europe are very much areas that can kick-start the European project. Economic measures are essential to restoring citizens’ confidence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as a Romanian, I am going to mention a particular theme of the Presidency of the Council, specifically the Schengen system. As President Barroso also said, total respect for the right of free movement in the EU is a priority. Given the delays in making a decision, I call on Denmark to find a solution for admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area this spring. The experts have reiterated their conclusions that both states have fulfilled all the technical criteria for accession. I believe that we all agree that the EU must not introduce double standards for old and new Member States.

At the EU Summit in December, Denmark was accused by the French President of being an outsider and a new, small Member State. It is clear that this Council Presidency, in the same way as its recent predecessors, will be overshadowed by the debt crisis. In this situation, healthy criticism of Europe may well be just the right approach to enable mediation between the euro countries and the non-euro countries and to allow the necessary steps, including the introduction of a core European monetary agreement, to be taken. We must hope that the scepticism shown by Denmark with regard to the removal of border controls when the Schengen Agreement was extended will result in the Commission not making the imposition of border controls more difficult without good reason and, therefore, not further restricting national sovereignty. When it comes to making the decision on Serbian accession status at the EU Summit in March, hopefully Denmark will abolish the double standards that have been in place until now and introduce fair treatment for Serbia. Ultimately, it is totally inappropriate for the EU to demand that Serbia recognises Kosovo when not all of its own Member States have done so. In addition, it is high time that the negotiations with Turkey on EU accession are turned into negotiations on a privileged partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot tinker with the stability of the population’s food supply.

Its opposition to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area was a sovereign decision on behalf of its own population. The EU could benefit from this approach. However, what do we have to fear? As a non-member of the euro area, Copenhagen will not be able to do much about the euro crisis. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy will continue to go it alone and to push through their own ideas. In addition, many people want to make more progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey.

I therefore hope that the Danish Presidency will give vital impetus to the expansion of the Schengen area and that this will apply as soon as possible with regard to Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

It is already encountering challenges simply on account of the turbulent recession and economic crisis in Europe. During its Presidency, Denmark is keen to be seen as the prime mover in a greener future for European energy. This is an important issue. Unfortunately, Denmark will probably hit a reef early on during its maiden voyage. Policy and the public will inevitably set their sights on remedying the economic situation. Denmark, as a country with an opt-out from the euro, will be in an awkward situation when there are debates on subjects such as citizenship, defence policy or legal and internal affairs. Denmark is not involved in such discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">We left the year 2011 with no solution to the economic crisis. Furthermore, an even more serious political crisis started. A stable economic union now has to be established outside the EU, with no right of initiative on the part of the Commission or democratic control on the part of the European Parliament. There is nothing wrong with the programme for the Danish Presidency. Its four priorities for sustainable growth are aimed at a more responsible, more dynamic, greener and safer Europe. I am sincerely optimistic about 2012, and I wish Denmark luck in its Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that in connection with this the Presidency is planning numerous initiatives in this area. According to UN forecasts, the proportion of people aged over 65 in Europe will be 23.8% by 2030.

<p class="contents">The problem of an ageing society is to a large extent being recognised as a challenge which must be faced by the entire European Union. We urgently need an effective European demographic policy with particular emphasis on economic and health issues. I hope that the Danish Presidency, as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, will support gender equality in accordance with the strategy of the Commission on this matter and with an adapted European Pact for Gender Equality. I call for completion of work on the proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.

However, I think that this Presidency will be the most difficult. We do believe, however, that the efficient and constructive Danish administration, which is experienced in managing Europe, will cope with the coordination of anti-crisis measures. However, we are also aware that as was the case with Poland, the fact that Denmark is not a member of the euro area may prove to be a hindrance. An equally important challenge facing the Danish Presidency is the need to agree key elements of the future budgetary framework for 2014-2020. There is no doubt that the negotiations will be very difficult. Our expectation is that Denmark will be able to find a compromise among the Member States which guarantees provision of funding at the appropriate level for every EU policy. I believe that the words being repeated by Danish politicians – a budget for the future – mean focussing the budget on meeting new challenges in particular areas, and not a radical redistribution or cuts. Personally, I am convinced that Denmark will manage to confront the challenges and fulfil the expectations we are placing in her. It should be reiterated that it was in fact during the Danish Presidency in the second half of 2002 that it was possible to complete the difficult accession negotiations with the group of 10 states of the New Europe, including Poland. I hope that today Denmark is capable of achieving similar successes in the area of budget negotiations and the fight against the debt crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not differentiate between individual countries in this respect. The momentum of European integration must not dissipate because of existing problems, and in this regard, too, the ambitious programme of the Danish Presidency represents a significant message: Europe must continue to pay attention to the expansion of the single market and the promotion of sustainable growth.

This is one way of characterising the priorities of the Danish Presidency. Europe has considerable problems at present. Economic, ecological, demographic, employment and other problems. Responsibility of Member States for their economies and budgets is priority number one, but it is also crucial for the fulfilment of other priorities. At present, however, cooperation within the EU institutional triangle, that is to say the Commission, Parliament and the Council, must be a priority if we want to address the problems of the European Union. However, experience so far shows a mutual non-acceptance. Typically, the Commission and Parliament will agree, but the Council will say no, because the individual representatives of the Member States first defend their own national interests, and then common, Europe-wide interests. Denmark therefore faces a big challenge, to try to achieve what its predecessors have failed to. That is, the mutual respect and cooperation of all Member States and European institutions to the benefit of all citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many European states hospitals and schools are being closed, the employment rate has declined alarmingly, and people are anxious about their future.

On the basis of these, the Danish Government is intending to solve the current economic crisis by working towards sustainable economic growth capable of creating jobs and wealth in the European continent; towards a Europe that is disciplined in financial terms, that exploits its full economic potential and that makes renewable energy central to the debate; towards a Europe that is, above all, safe for Europeans. We can make out on the horizon that its task will not be easy, but the ambition of this programme demonstrates the commitment of this Member State that, while it is not in the euro area, is emphasising its commitment to the future intergovernmental agreement, which is key if short-, medium- and long-term measures for combating the sovereign debt crisis are to be established. As such, in the committees of which I am member, I should like to emphasise the objective of continuing with the reforms to cohesion policy and the high priority given to the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 and, in the area of transport, the reference to the Connecting Europe Facility as an engine for realising a true single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what has happened at the very beginning of the Danish Presidency is not to be welcomed, particularly Denmark’s role in the most important of current negotiations – the negotiations on the fiscal compact. The Presidency should look after the interest of the entire Union, and should oppose any kind of divisions within the Union which would be caused if the agreement of all the Member States were not secured.

Only by strengthening cooperation in a spirit of solidarity can we build a single, truly common, effective and innovative market, which will be able to maintain its global position not just for several years, but for several decades. However, this requires choosing a difficult route and setting ourselves ambitious political, economic and social objectives, which none of the Member States can achieve on their own. This enormous effort must be made at all levels, from the teaching and development of children and young people, through social organisations and businesses and all the people involved in their operation, to people and organisations working in the international arena, because only in this way can we be effective in working together to give permanent strength to the foundations of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is coordination of the economies of the individual Member States. Citizens feel threatened by the crisis and expect concerted action at European level. The Danish Presidency has set realistic goals in this area. Their ambition is to be consistent and implement the measures agreed by the Council and subsequently this Parliament. Citizens want coordination, however, not centralisation. That is why I warmly welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency of the Council rejects the introduction of a European tax on financial transactions. Citizens consider the second major priority to be tackling poverty and social exclusion. Here, Denmark could build on the results of the Hungarian Presidency in the social sphere and the promotion of solidarity between the generations. Improving conditions for the family, which forms the basic social network, should be one of the top priorities of European countries during a crisis. Paradoxically, however, it was during the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations that the family ceased to be a political priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is so true that this presidency in no way breaks with the capitalist model of the European Union – as no other has done – that the priorities set out in its programme leave no room for doubt: deepening the internal market; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the ‘stealth’ increase in the retirement age; the support for implementation of the decisions of so-called economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact, and the intergovernmental treaty; and, not to forget, what is called combating terrorism, with all the security measures that this concept entails. This is essentially a presidency that confirms the path of austerity and of withdrawing social, economic and political rights that the European Union has been imposing. Instead, the necessary path of breaking with capitalism in order to combat its crisis involves combating measures that increase exploitation and the accumulation of capital, the promotion of jobs with rights, trade rules based on complementarity rather than competitiveness, and the promotion of social rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
