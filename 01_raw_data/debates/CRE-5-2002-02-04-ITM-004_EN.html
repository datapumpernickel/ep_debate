The present report deals with a Commission proposal with a view to the adoption of a Council framework decision. It aims to help create an area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for by the Treaties, particularly since Amsterdam, and for which, subsequently too, a programme had been expressly scheduled during summit meetings. However, the proposal in question is not terribly far-reaching. More specifically, it is about the common fight against cross-border crime, particularly in terms of making arrangements regarding minimum maximum penalties to be included in the legislation of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the entire document has been written in such a way as to maximise its chances of being adopted by the Council, which means that it merely codifies the lowest common denominator emerging from what is to be included in the legislation of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As such, it has, in fact, become a fairly modest document which we in the Committee thought required some more reinforcement in places. The reinforcement should be sufficiently constructive to ensure that the improvements remain within the realms of what is possible. We have therefore not held an explicit debate on drugs policy. Neither in the framework decision, nor in the proposal did we want to include a decision on whether certain drugs should be legalised or not, and neither did we want to draw a distinction between certain soft and hard drugs. These issues are all far too ambitious. Our goal is, in fact, far more modest. I therefore hope that, during the vote, we will reject the amendments which do implicitly deal with these issues, so that we can present to the Council a viable proposal which is in line with the opinions that are, democratically speaking, held by the majority of the European population. We have tried – and we have, in my opinion, reached consensus about this in the Committee – to tighten up the proposal in terms of penalties, for example by not seeking to replace custodial sentences by alternative penalties where serious offenders are concerned. For them, spending twenty-four hours helping out in an old people’s home does not really constitute a suitable, alternative punitive measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have already suggested that the Commission and the Council should perhaps consider the options of civil law penalties which particularly affect offenders in terms of what is most dear to them, namely their possessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we agree that we would prefer not to develop a shadow bureaucracy under the authority of the Council’s Secretary-General. If the Treaty of Amsterdam already mentions a transfer of elements from the third pillar to the first pillar, this must be implemented, and we should refrain from leaping forward to an entirely different policy by instituting a shadow bureaucracy under the Secretary-General.</p>
<p class="contents">Even within the Dutch political spectrum, I am not one of the extremists, but rather a moderate, on this score. I am therefore of the opinion that this legal approach with regard to penalties etc. forms a kind of tailpiece and is not the most important component of our drugs policy as a whole. What matters most are the preventive and therapeutic measures, and the policy developed in these sectors. However, we should not neglect the legal approach because, to a large extent, it has a lot to do with keeping the peace. This is therefore very much a tailpiece that should have its place.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, and on behalf of all of us, I believe that Community cooperation should be imposed in a more stringent manner at times, whilst maintaining respect for the national courts’ own boundaries, maybe even somewhat more respect than has already been shown in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the amendments. Following the vote, thirteen amendments have been tabled in the Committee, something which I am not terribly happy about. Or rather, I would like to advise against nearly all of them. In Amendment No 37, the idea that we will not focus on the prosecution of addicts is broadened to also include users. In my view, it is not for the report to comment on this but, rather, up to the Member States to decide on the policy they generally wish to enforce, or resume enforcing, where users are concerned. In any case, it is clear that our position in terms of not wishing to prosecute addicts is based on our preference for a therapeutic emphasis in our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have noticed that the words ‘large-scale’, ‘international’, ‘cross-border’ and ‘organised’ appear liberally in these thirteen other amendments. This is rather forced in my opinion. They are already used a few times in the text itself, and it seems as if the people who tabled these amendments are, in fact, on a mission to restrict the scope of the proposal. The text even states that action is to be taken specifically if the trade is from one EU country to another EU country. Adding the words I have just mentioned seems downright ridiculous. For what arrives directly from Columbia, Surinam and the Dutch Antilles would not fall within the scope of this framework decision. I would really advise against adopting these amendments in the strongest terms. Incitement and complicity too are exempted from the scope of this proposal in one of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that there are some that are more liberal in their inclinations than the rapporteur. Since he himself is not one of the strictest people, I would therefore, in fact, like to reject all amendments which I consider to be unduly liberal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate Mr Oostlander on the quality of this report, into which he has put a great deal of hard work, and to which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats gives its unreserved support. The issue of drugs is a central concern of Europe’s citizens. For years, the European Parliament has demonstrated its commitment to the fight against drugs. And today, the European dimension of this fight is clear to see in actions that range from the adoption of legal instruments to combat the manufacture of drugs, the trafficking of drugs and money-laundering to cooperation with producer countries and promoting the prevention of drug addiction and the fight against it, involving treatment, rehabilitation and even the development of information and coordination networks between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear in mind that, since the end of the ‘cold war’, there has been an unprecedented increase in drug trafficking as a source of funding for the activities of criminal and terrorist organisations. It is currently estimated that drug-related crime and drug trafficking itself could represent approximately eight per cent of world trade. Putting an end to this trafficking would, therefore, mean shutting down the largest sources of funding for these criminal and terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a framework decision, however, as Mr Oostlander quite rightly pointed out, proposes nothing new and nor does it strengthen the mechanisms for combating international drug trafficking. The proposal is a necessary step, and we know that it is intended to respond to the needs identified both in the Vienna action plan and in the Tampere conclusions, as well as in the European Union 2000-2004 Drugs Strategy. This is, indeed, a necessary step, but an inadequate one: it is limited to establishing the lowest common denominator of the national provisions in force in each Member State for offences in the field of drug trafficking. Consequently the Member States must adopt the necessary measures to ensure that these offences are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, including custodial sentences with a maximum term of imprisonment of no less than five years in serious cases. Now, in my opinion, this is a very low limit, especially given that the legislation in force in the Member States already imposes heavy penalties for drug trafficking, in particular when the scale and the seriousness of the case can be considered to be aggravating circumstances. For example, in my country, Portugal, this limit is twelve years, and can be increased by one-third.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to mention an aspect which is of the greatest importance, and that is the confiscation of all illicit proceeds acquired directly or indirectly from the crime of trafficking or from being a member of a criminal organisation or of a plot to traffic drugs. I feel that this will satisfy the wishes of many of the organisations that have made a remarkable effort in the fight against drugs, that some of the proceeds obtained through the confiscation of these goods can be put to use in the policy of prevention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Elaborate expositions used to turn everything upside down and used to touch on family, belief and authority. Today, the waters are somewhat calmer. Since the European Commission proposal is confined to the legal aspects, level-headedness is what is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission rightly underlines in its proposal, the responsibility for combating illegal drug trafficking lies first and foremost with the Member States. However, since it is often a case of organised trafficking which encompasses various countries, a framework decision which tackles this cross-border trafficking can be a useful addition to national policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is missing from the proposal submitted by the Commission is a differentiation between the different kinds of drugs and, consequently, a differentiated penalisation of illegal drug trafficking. An increasing number of countries in Europe distinguish soft and hard drugs on the basis of the health risks to which they give rise, and there is also increasingly more political support for a policy based on straightforward information campaigns and on the prevention of health risks. On this basis, a few Member States are adopting a tolerant policy with regard to soft drugs. It is not the intention that the present framework decision should scrap this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as penalisation is concerned, all kinds of factors need to be taken into consideration in order to establish effective and proportionate punishment. Unfortunately, the criteria for determining the seriousness of the crime, such as the extent of trafficking and the nature and availability of the products involved, have not been included in the proposal. This is why my group, together with three other groups, has tabled an amendment in order to have such criteria included. Cultural differences and the different prosecution policies of the Member States, combined with the principle of subsidiarity, provide good reason for restricting this proposal to organised and cross-border illegal drug trafficking. Only with this restriction does the large majority of my group deem that this framework decision represents added value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The drugs situation in Europe is becoming worse and worse. The fact that our borders are becoming ever more open is basically something to be welcomed, of course, but the downside of this is that smuggling, including drug smuggling, is on the increase. I am concerned that it looks as if more and more countries are abandoning clear and explicit restrictive attitudes to drug abuse. Our objective must be nothing other than a drugs-free Europe. Giving up that objective would be tantamount to leaving thousands of young people in the lurch.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am well aware of Mr Oostlander’s problems in arriving at a balanced view. In general, I think he has succeeded. I welcome the more restrictive tone he has adopted here today, but there are wordings I do not agree with. What is absolutely clear is that the amendments are along completely the wrong lines. To embrace a permissive attitude towards so-called soft drugs would be devastating. We know that these are the gateway to heavy drug abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">We Swedish Liberals, and a large proportion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in general, will vote against <span class="italic">all</span> attempts to relax the strict and clear policy on drugs. We reject Amendments Nos 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 37. We are able to accept Amendments Nos 32 and 36. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am not so certain. To me, illegal drug trafficking is simply too broad a term. Mr Oostlander is opposed to the Dutch practice of tolerance, and that is fine. I am myself of the opinion that it is only a half-baked compromise. I would prefer to see soft drugs legalised, which are, after all, less harmful than the alcohol which flows abundantly in this establishment too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only in the Netherlands that soft drugs are tolerated. For reasons of public health, this policy is also being replicated in other countries at local, regional and sometimes even national level. We may be making bold statements now, but matters will prove different in practice. Let us therefore confine our efforts to a policy which we can implement, which is also a European task according to the principle of subsidiarity and on which there is broad parliamentary and social consensus, namely a policy to tackle lucrative, organised, cross-border drug trafficking. Mr Oostlander is entitled to thrash out the rest at national level. After all, the elections are in the offing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can be assured that any report by Mr Oostlander is backed by a great sense of purpose and integrity. I have known him for a long time and I am absolutely certain that he means what he says in this particular report. With 3,000 miles of coastline around Ireland, the possibility of illicit drug smuggling is always present. Cooperation at European level is therefore not only to be welcomed but is also essential. I look forward to more concrete proposals at EU level as to how the EU can further help us keep drugs not only out of Ireland but also out of the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What sort of a message do Members want to send from this Parliament? Drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are okay? I do not accept that. The decision has to be up to the Members of this House. But the choice is clear: either you support Mr Oostlander or you send out the dangerous message that heroin and synthetic drugs for personal use and distribution are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 28 by the PSE Group, the Verts/ALE Group and the GUE/NGL Group and others cannot be misinterpreted: "... users who produce, acquire and/or possess drugs for personal use and users who supply drugs to others without the intention of making a profit are excluded from the scope of this framework decision." Therefore, it is all right to supply heroin to children or to adults, as long as you do not want to make a profit from it. Who in fact makes the profit? It is the great drug barons whom we seem to tolerate. We seem to be able to pursue the terrorists responsible for the horrific events of 11 September, but it seems to be beyond us to tackle international drug terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">We must know who they are. In fact the murder of the journalist Veronica Guerin in my country galvanised politicians and police into action which smashed a savage gangster culture in Ireland. Unfortunately, those gangsters have been replaced by other younger and even more vicious criminals. During the past week, on business in the inner city in my constituency, I witnessed whole complexes riven by drugs. They must be tackled. The people who are producing this cocaine and heroin, and causing such havoc in our cities and towns and the countryside, must be stopped. Mr Oostlander's report is a small but very important step in that direction. This report has all the integrity that is expected of this Parliament. I thank him for his efforts in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It merely codifies the lowest common denominator to emerge from the legislation in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, I happen to be pleased with this cautious approach by the Commission. Criminal law is an area which is strongly influenced by national culture and history. In my view, restraint is still essential when competences are transferred to European level. Only where clear-cut, cross-border issues arise can European legislation offer added value.</p>
<p class="contents">This opinion seems to be shared by few in Parliament. Imagine my surprise when, this time, I was overtaken on the right by my fellow MEPs from the socialist and green groups. With their amendments, they set great store by the concepts of the subsidiarity principle, cultural differences and national legislation, while the issue in question, namely illegal drug trafficking, is clearly a cross-border problem which requires European legislation. My fellow MEPs want to add the words ‘cross-border’ and ‘organised’ to the definition. To me, these concepts appear to be inherent to drug trafficking and need not be added. At best, they will complicate implementation of the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the rapporteur struggled with this simple codification of the lowest common denominator to emerge from Member States’ legislation. Those who tabled the amendments seem to be wrestling with the lowest common denominator itself. This does demonstrate that the subsidiarity principle is nothing more than an argument that is dusted down for the occasion in order to protect a Dutch drugs policy that is out of step internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposal which makes a responsible start on combating illegal drug trafficking, a cross-border problem which directly affects the security of European citizens. In my view, the fact that the Netherlands can get into difficulty because legislation there is not applied as it should be seems to be a result of inconsistent policy. Policy needs to be aligned to European and international legislation, and not the other way round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He committed suicide by inhaling the exhaust fumes of his car, because he had been accused, Mr Oostlander, of drug trafficking after the police found 2.5g of hashish on his person. These are the facts, Mr Oostlander, this is not something out of a novel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the way in which the police forces of various European Union Member States are interpreting the policy that you are proposing to us to combat serious crime and this is the way that the harmonisation that you are proposing is interpreted. Against all logic, this harmonisation is interfering in the affairs of the Member States of the European Union; it boils down to absurd policies – in a country such as France, for example – and restrictions for the States which are finally beginning to understand. I am thinking here of the State to which you belong, namely the Netherlands, where you have not approved the policy, but I now also have in mind Belgium, Portugal and Spain, where Members of the <span class="italic">Partido Popular Español</span> are conducting some very worthwhile experiments in Madrid into risk reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a policy that we obviously cannot harmonise. What we must harmonise is always the worst – it is a very libertine approach to law, Mr Oostlander, because you are proposing laws which cannot be applied. The Liberals and the ‘libertarians’ want laws that can be applied; but you adopt a libertine approach to the law. And for 30 years, your policy has, day in, day out, produced laws that have never been applied. Your policy is also destroying entire countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Laos and Burma. These countries are literally being destroyed by your prohibitionist drugs policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in addition to the many friendly pats on the back that I get from numerous fellow Members, even from the centre right, Mr Oostlander, these Members realise that this prohibitionist policy is a criminal policy that encourages crime; they realise that we must adopt a very different approach. Even if you try to limit the scope of your report, as you tried to do in your opening remarks, it is going in completely the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should not be getting involved in this. The Commission was not capable of saying no to Mr Arlacchi and to his criminal form of management that lasted five years, which consisted of recycled KGB officers and Russian generals who were involved in drug trafficking. We all know this – these are the facts that we read every day in the newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let the Commission deal with things that it knows how to deal with! The Commission should take a look at the UNDCP reports, but should stop bothering us with absolutely absurd proposals such as this. I think that it is high time that Parliament had the courage to be slightly less hypocritical, and for it to do what our fellow Members Chris Davies and Marco Cappato recently did in Great Britain; as MEPs, we must finally demonstrate the absurdity of these laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the main proposal, on penalties, is geared to an upper limit of no less than five years, meaning that judges are free to decide between no penalty at all and several years. This, of course, does little for harmonisation because almost all national laws allow for severer penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should point out that with the proposed amendments, most of which I trust will be adopted, we have managed to extract some secondary benefit from this decision. First, they state quite clearly that addicts should be treated as patients rather than criminals and that drug abuse should not be a criminal offence. Secondly, it is proposed that revenue from property confiscated from drug barons should be used for prevention and therapy programmes. Finally, I hope that future Commission proposals will be more ambitious and will set clear, harmonised minimum rather than maximum limits on penalties for the worst drug traffickers so that we can secure an area of security and justice within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we hit these people where it really hurts, namely in their wallets, this will be far more effective than stiff custodial sentences. Neither should we focus on the prosecution of addicts, but rather pour all our energy into prevention. This is a sound message which, with limited resources, Europe must take as a guiding principle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is where our paths diverge. I am delighted that, following a European trend to adopt a more realistic drugs policy, a majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be supporting all the amendments aimed at distinguishing between hard drugs and soft drugs and at the non-prosecution of users, as well as the amendments which will restrict this proposal to cross-border, criminal drug trafficking. Let us concentrate our limited resources on the big criminals rather than the small users.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, should like to warn fellow MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats against engaging in token politics when they talk of dangerous signals which Parliament would in this way be sending out. In the final analysis, we do not yet have any say in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also places question marks alongside two specific Commission proposals. It would be unwise not simply to limit the minimum maximum penalty of five years to certain crimes but to arrange for it to be applied to all drugs-related crimes. We will accordingly be backing the amendment for a restriction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in our view, the arrangement through which informers would receive a penalty reduction in exchange for information about drugs gangs is going too far. This is a very sensitive matter in which different Member States uphold different traditions. To make an arrangement in this way, so suddenly, would be taking things too far in our view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is not the entire European policy on drugs: this proposal deals with only one specific component, which is the fight against drug trafficking. But our approach to the issue of drugs in the European Union is part of the Action Plan for 2000-2004, which will be assessed at its halfway point, some time this year. In Laeken, the Heads of State and Government asked us to approve the framework decision on the harmonisation of penalties at European level for drug trafficking by the end of May of this year. That is the sole purpose of this proposal. The Commission is of the view that, in the fight against drug trafficking, there must be close cooperation between the various judicial, police and customs authorities of the Member States to deal with the challenge of transnational drug trafficking. If such cooperation is going to be effective, it must be underpinned by a common approach at Union level, specifically in the approximation of definitions of the charges and penalties that apply to trafficking, which must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the objectives set out in Mr Oostlander’s report. Measures to clamp down on traffickers must clearly be supplemented and backed with a policy of prevention and the social rehabilitation of drug addicts. The instrument that is envisaged is only intended to cover the penal aspects of the drugs phenomenon. The Commission worked on this criminal law initiative, you might say, in full awareness of the facts, for we had carried out major preparatory work, in particular studying the definitions in each Member State, the penalties that can be applied under the law and – of no less importance – the specific ways in which penalties for drug trafficking are applied in each of the 15 Member States. This study, which was made public, consequently enabled us to make a comparative analysis of the legislation of all the Member States in the field of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the first important point to make is that our objective is to harmonise penalties for drug trafficking. This proposal should not be considered to be limited to transnational or cross-border trafficking because the two issues amount to the same thing: in most drugs cases, the trafficking starts outside Europe and is, therefore, always transnational. I therefore fail to see how we can envisage punishing cross-border trafficking more severely than the serious trafficking we are seeing within every Member State. The States cannot have two penal codes, one to be applied to drug trafficking that takes place exclusively within their borders and another for drug trafficking that has a cross-border dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the second issue: the definition of drug trafficking. The Commission has already been criticised for lacking ambition where this matter is concerned. What have we done wrong? We have limited ourselves to taking up the key elements of the United Nations’ 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances, and we have combined this definition with national provisions on the definition of offences related to drug trafficking. We have, therefore, simply attempted to produce a synthesis of definitions of drug trafficking. However, here – and this is my third important observation – we have respected the principle of subsidiarity. This is why the individual consumption of drugs is not included in this definition and nor is the not-for-profit sale of drugs for personal consumption. These are left to the exclusive jurisdiction of each Member State, because, as this debate has demonstrated, in this field the solutions put forward by the fifteen Member States differ widely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal will not, therefore, change these differences in national legislation in the areas in which drug trafficking for the purposes of personal consumption is considered not to incur punishment. But when the trafficking is of such a scale and seriousness that it has to incur penalties, the Commission proposes that these should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The minimum penalty of a maximum sentence of five years is a sanction which provides not only considerable room for manoeuvre for judges to apply the law according to the circumstances of each case of trafficking, but it is also a proposal that seeks to convey an idea of the harshness with which we wish to punish the cases of drug trafficking to which this penalty applies.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in some countries – and Mr Coelho mentioned the case of Portugal – the minimum penalty of the maximum sentence is heavier than this. I must say that in other countries, the penalty is lighter, and we feel that this sentence of five years represents a minimum standard for harmonisation, giving, of course, each Member State the option of establishing other, harsher standards in its legislation for the minimum maximum penalty than can be applied. However, this is an issue that is being discussed at Council level. I feel, therefore, that this proposal, which I hope Parliament will approve, is an initial step in a fight in which all Member States participate against drug trafficking, which threatens the health, the security and the quality of life of our citizens, and which, as Mr Oostlander has pointed out, is one of the sources of funding for countless other criminal activities, including terrorism itself. In this context, I hope that Parliament will support the report and will enable the Council to adopt this framework decision by the end of May this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
