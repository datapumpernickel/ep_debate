<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European Union's relations with Cuba are governed by the common position originally adopted by the Council in 1996, which has been updated and renewed regularly. The common position advocates a policy of constructive engagement with Cuba through enhanced dialogue with government and civil society with the objective of encouraging 'a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people'. This constructive engagement has remained our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the large-scale imprisonment of dissidents in 2003, the Union took a series of political measures. In June 2003 the EU decided to limit bilateral high-level visits to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events, to invite Cuban members of the peaceful opposition to their national day celebrations alongside government representatives and to re-evaluate the common position ahead of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent re-evaluation of the common position in June this year re-affirmed the policy of constructive engagement as the basis of EU policy towards Cuba. The EU has repeatedly underscored the importance of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and has indicated its willingness to restart such a dialogue when conditions permit. The European Commission deplores the Cuban Government's decision to freeze relations with all embassies of EU Member States that have invited dissidents to their national days and with the Commission delegation in Havana, as well as the refusal of direct aid from the European Union. Despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission has continued funding actions by NGOs and humanitarian actions managed by ECHO.</p>
<p class="contents">In October 2004 the Commission took a decision to provide EUR 1 million in humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable victims of hurricanes Ivan and Charlie in Cuba. We should not really talk about humanitarian assistance in this context because we would deliver humanitarian assistance in any case, without any political considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the Cuban Government to release certain dissidents on health grounds is a positive gesture to an improved situation, but not sufficient to warrant full revocation of the measures decided by the Council in June last year. The aim continues to be the release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The June measures are currently being reviewed by the Council. The European Council wishes to stress that the result of this review has to be consistent with the overall aims of the common position and the human rights policy of the EU. In the Commission's view, this could provide a basis for a constructive and future-oriented EU policy towards Cuba, which would be conducive to attaining the objectives of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have asked whether the delegation in Havana can really function meaningfully in the present circumstances. I want to make it clear that the delegation in Havana is essential to carry out the tasks that Parliament has asked the Commission to undertake. Our presence in Cuba is more important today than ever. The main tasks of the delegation are not only to assist with the implementation of eight programmes and projects, but also to promote a political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society, to monitor human rights issues and to protect the trade and investment interests of Member States. This is a heavy, important, and sometimes difficult agenda to pursue, but it is essential if we wish to promote political and economic improvements in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I would say that 2003 was a sad year in our relations with Cuba. In my view, it was a lost opportunity for Cuba and the EU that membership of the Cotonou Agreement did not succeed. I hope that what happened in 2003 will not turn out to be irreversible. I still find Cuban membership of the Cotonou Agreement a very meaningful framework for our relations. It represents the basic structure of how we would like to organise and govern north-south relations. Cuban participation in Cotonou also means that Cuba would be subject to peer pressure within the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that it is still possible to keep an open mind, but that also means an open mind inside Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the dialogue that we advocate, that we believe in and which we put into practice, Mr President, has not been wrecked by any government of the European Union, nor by Osvaldo Payá, nor by Elisardo Sánchez, nor by Marta Beatriz Roque, but by the policy of executions, the arrest of independent journalists - such as Raúl Rivero, who is currently rotting in Cuban prisons, and others - and the policy of arresting peaceful dissidents and human rights campaigners.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these events, our Parliament cannot remain deaf, dumb and blind. The Council's common position, which some people wish pointlessly to alter – and we have the results of today’s comparison, which have been a spectacular disaster for the approach of changing it - requesting a new report from the Ambassadors in Havana, has served, as expressed by Mario Vargas Llosa in an article published recently in the <span class="italic">El País</span> newspaper, to send a clear message to the millions of Cubans who cannot protest, vote or escape, that they are not alone, that they have not been abandoned and that the western democracies are with them.</p>
<p class="contents">What is proposed to us by certain political groups in this Parliament in their resolution, where there is not even any mention of calling for the release of political prisoners? To cooperate and talk with the villains and mock the victims? To be complacent towards those who oppress them? To seek a policy of appeasement and friendship with tyranny?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Andrei Sakharov, who left us a legacy of moral integrity and a significant lesson in peaceful co-existence between peoples, said that the voices that count are often those which cannot be heard. Mr President, the forced absence from the Sakharov Prize award ceremony last year of one of its most honourable recipients, Osvaldo Payá, is the best possible argument for speaking out on behalf of those people inside and outside of Cuba who are fighting for their freedom and dignity, and for this Parliament, Mr President, to be very forceful in its demand for freedom, as it has always been. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There have been two characteristics of the European Union’s policy on Cuba over recent years that have set that country apart, made it an exception, all in line with an unjustifiable approach which the founders of that policy were never able to justify. The European Union’s dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of the world includes a chapter on the human rights situation. It is an extremely important chapter, but there are others. Only in the case of Cuba is the human rights chapter exclusive, precluding any other chapter which should exist in our relations with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with all the countries of the world, the European Union’s dialogue and cooperation is aimed at overcoming shortcomings in the field of human rights. Only in the case of Cuba do those human rights shortcomings become a prior condition, preventing dialogue and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point we must carry out an objective evaluation of that policy, the results of which have been a complete failure. Such an objective view reveals that, through this policy, not the slightest progress has been made in relation to freedoms or human rights in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, this policy has been a disaster for European interests in Cuba and it is condemned equally by businesspeople, non-governmental organisations, artists, religious leaders, etc. It has also been disastrous in terms of our diplomatic representatives carrying out their activities normally in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, this policy has demonstrated a complete distancing of our European societies from their respective national governments and the European Union itself, and absolutely no notice has been taken of their views. Similarly, various initiatives ignored or even boycotted by official bodies have attracted a great deal of participation from artists, authors, businesspeople and citizens of our countries. I am referring, for example, to the art biennale, the book fair, the ballet festival or the trade fair in Havana.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vice-Chairman of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, has been in Cuba over recent days carrying out a programme of contacts at the highest level. It was no doubt to him that a distinguished colleague was referring when on Monday he talked about the visitors to the island, and I am sure it was with particular bitterness that his party colleague spoke of him.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that this policy has damaged Europe’s credibility in Cuba and in the whole of Latin America, by giving the impression that we are supporting US strategies in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this assessment, our conclusion is that the policy pursued so far by the European Union in relation to Cuba, and which is based on the common position and measures, must be reviewed, rationalised and updated. What we are saying is in line with what several Member State governments are saying in the European Council. Furthermore, we would make it absolutely clear that the change of policy we are advocating must not only mean not giving up on any of our objectives – expressed at the beginning of my speech – but must confirm them and aspire to contributing to achieving them more effectively than has been the case so far.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that the progress we are pursuing for Cubans and for European interests in Cuba will be achieved more easily through broad and rigorous dialogue and cooperation, which is critical whenever it needs to be, but never hostile and without making any prejudgements. Furthermore, in doing so we will be applying the same approach to that country as we do to China, Vietnam, Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan and also the United States and dozens of other countries in which we note very serious shortcomings, which in many cases are much more serious than those in Cuba, in terms of freedoms, human rights and the Rule of Law, but with which we talk and cooperate precisely with a view to improving the things we do not like.</p>

Exactly two years ago, we awarded the Cuban democracy activist, Oswaldo Payá our Sakharov Prize. It was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that had proposed him for this prize, and he received it for his courageous fight for democracy and justice in Cuba. He received it as a representative of all Cubans from different party groups: Christian Democrats, Liberals, Social Democrats and others who, by peaceful means, are trying to pave the way for a new Cuba without Castro, whether his name be Fidel or Raoul.</p>
<p class="contents">Payá and the others are working for a Cuba in which democracy, human rights, pluralism, freedom and justice exist for all. It was not easy getting Oswaldo Payá here. On several occasions, the Cuban regime tried to prevent him from coming, but we succeeded in the end. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in getting him to come back.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Oswaldo Payá was awarded the Sakharov Prize, the situation in Cuba has deteriorated. About eighty democracy activists have been arrested and sentenced, following farcical trials, to very long prison sentences. They are now spread out over the island. They are faring badly. Their living conditions are appalling, and they very rarely see their families. Many of them are ill.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met many of these people. They are fantastic, courageous people who wish to adopt a peaceful route to establishing human dignity and democracy for themselves and their fellow countrymen. For Castro, the dictator pathetically romanticised by many in Europe, these people are, however, a grave threat. That is why they had to be silenced. That is why they have been imprisoned. Osvaldo himself is at liberty, and his family is harassed on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Cuba, one of the world’s last Communist dictatorships, is worse. No progress has been made since the Council toughened its so-called common position. Castro continues to be intractable. He appears to want to isolate the country completely. Just as the Commissioner said, he is boycotting the EU and our Member States. Several Members of the European Parliament, including Swedish MEPs, have been denied entry to the country. There is a debate at the present moment as to whether the EU should modify its common position or make it less stringent. That would be very unfortunate. Why should we reward Castro when there is no progress on human rights? For once, the EU has a consistent position on a dictatorship. Why, then, should we change it?</p>
<p class="contents">Oswaldo Payá and the other dissidents are appealing to us to hold fast to our values and to the policy we have adopted. That is why it is important to intensify our dialogue with the dissidents and to support a gradual transition to democracy. We honoured Oswaldo Payá and the other Cuban democracy activists here in this House, and that was a long-term commitment. We must stand up for human rights and vigorously reject a change to the common position. Just like ourselves, Cubans are entitled to democracy and human rights. Let us show them which side we are on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us, the defence of all the rights of Cubans is a key issue. We have always called for the release of all prisoners and we also call for a clear transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The question at the moment is how best to push Cuba towards democracy; after 40 years of embargo, and now with the European Union’s sanctions, we can see that this method is not effective and that the best way to help Cuban society is not to isolate it, but rather to create increasingly close and strong relations with Cuban civil society, to help the NGOs in society. The openness of Cuban society is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot help a society which wants to move towards democracy by means of a confrontation which only seeks, through the resolution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a break-off of relations with unforeseeable consequences, when what we want, as for any part of the world, is an agreed transition, without violence, which can lead to the democracy which everybody, in particular the Verts/ALE Group, is seeking.</p>

You see, Cuba is an example of a small island attempting to determine its own existence, and to do so in a way that is different compared with the great imperial power. We look on this with solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we are also able to express our criticisms, explicitly and without restraint, as we have done and continue to do, as regards the death penalty and certain judicial procedures, for example. However, we consider it mistaken, unjust and unacceptable that punitive measures should be taken against Cuba. For decades, Cuba has suffered from a ferocious economic blockade imposed by the US administration. Frankly, there is no reason why Europe should align itself with such measures. On the contrary, it is precisely relations, trade and engagement that can foster understanding and improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">In Latin America important and historic events are taking place, as witnessed by the victory of progressive forces in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Uruguay. By comparison with the logic of laissez-faire globalisation and war – and today we have seen some terrible images – the need for an alternative politics is emerging: Cuba is part of this Latin America. The relationship with Europe helps this Latin America, and the relationship with Latin America helps Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for the abolition of all measures discriminating against Cuba and, consequently, of the Council’s common position; a similar demand must be addressed to the US Government. At the same time, we call for a strengthening of free and fruitful relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fidel Castro’s antics are hard to follow, both literally and figuratively, but also politically, socio-economically and culturally speaking. <span class="italic">El líder</span> stands his ground. His word is law. Just ask the opposition. It becomes the European Union that it wishes to recognise and support the independent Cuban spirits. Today, however, this policy is under internal pressure. According to reports, the Spanish Government in particular would like to leave Cuban dissidents out in the cold from now on, and Madrid is looking to recruit allies among the other Member States. This unfortunate development prompted the Christian trade union leader in my country, Doekle Terpstra, to send a letter to the Dutch Presidency earlier this week. This letter urges the European Union not to make any concessions in respect of Castro’s dictatorship in exchange for trade benefits. I am only too pleased to lend my backing to this appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission whether there is any coordination between the EU’s human rights policy and that of the United States with regard to Castro’s Cuba? If so, how do they intend to reinforce it?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a request to the Commission. As a Member of this House, I am looking forward to a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Cuba, including future scenarios, from your point of view. The fact that we have an official delegation in Havana should make this feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with the appeal by Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas. Thanks to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I have just read the letter that is addressed to the President of this House. This letter is basically saying that all governments, regional and international associations and institutions, should, if they really wish to enter into normal relations with Cuba, begin by demanding amnesty for the political prisoners. We should avoid at all costs forging relationships while the rights of all Cubans are still being violated. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 5 June 2003, the Council voted unanimously to impose political sanctions on the Cuban regime, following the indictment of 75 dissidents and the death sentence imposed on three citizens who had tried to flee to the United States. This event unfortunately fits into a general picture of continued and repeated violations and negation of fundamental freedoms in Cuba, as also confirmed recently by COLAT.</p>

<p class="contents">Europe should therefore pursue the firm path it has embarked upon, taking particular care, however, to avoid at all costs any further negative repercussions for the population, with the aim of laying the foundations for a productive and renewed dialogue free of resentment between the Cuban people and Europe in the period after Fidel Castro: friends of Cuba, friends of the Cubans, enemies of all dictators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, because the manoeuvring is not consistent with the constant, repeated and dramatic demands of those people who are fighting peacefully and suffering in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">They are shadowy manoeuvres and appear to show such a desire to betray our 2002 Sakharov Prize winner, that I am reminded of a poem by a great lady of Portuguese poetry, Sofia de Mello Breyner, who died a few weeks ago: ‘Tears for today’. ‘We will never cry enough when we see a creative gesture stopped. We will never cry enough when we see a person with the courage to fight destroyed by contempt, malice and other means we know of which are so cunning, so subtle and so expert that they are almost beyond description’.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about Cuba and the Cuban regime, we must always ask ourselves the question: what kind of Parliament is this? A Parliament of freedom or a Parliament of repression, a Parliament of the citizen or a Parliament of the tyrant? That is the question we must answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking on our own behalf, but on behalf of the actual people fighting and suffering for freedom and democracy. This is not a party-political issue; it is a fundamental political and human issue for the real people over in Cuba, where the pain is felt, who are watching us and listening to us: Bárbaro Sevilla García, 22 years old, executed; Lorenzo Copello Castillo, 30 years old, executed; Jorge Luis Martínez Izak, 40 years old, executed; Víctor Rolando Arroyo Carmona, sentenced to 26 years in prison; Miguel Galbán Gutiérrez, sentenced to 26 years in prison; Jorge Vero Castañeda, sentenced to 20 years in prison; Pablo Pacheco Ávila, sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mr President, I do not have time now to read all the names of the dozens of victims of the tragic March of 2003, and their families, friends and colleagues. There are so many of them that I do not have time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the significance of not having time to name them all? It means that this is not the time to change our European policy, but rather for Fidel Castro and the Cuban regime to change theirs. That is what is needed.

I would even add for our collective credibility as institutions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba has suffered for many years the unacceptable, unilateral and revengeful policy of isolation and commercial and economic exclusion of the United States, which has pushed the Cuban people into poverty and forced the regime to harden. Unfortunately, this deadlock policy, which is characterised by selective sensitivity to the question of human rights and democratic freedoms, was also applied by the European Union in its decisions to impose sanctions and freeze relations and dialogue. This had a very adverse effect at all levels. The planned objective was not achieved, in that European public opinion itself, non-governmental organisations and business and cultural associations ignored the official policy of the European Union and continued to maintain relations and work with Cuban society.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be honest. The situation in human rights, the rule of law and democratic freedoms in Cuba is not good. However, as international experience has proven, isolation and segregation are not a credible or effective policy. Wherever such a policy has been applied, the people have ultimately paid the price.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, and the Council of Ministers in particular, should radically rethink its deadlock stand and have the courage to lift sanctions and restore relations with Cuba immediately. It should proceed to establish political dialogue, as a means of advancing relations and as a means of controlling the conduct of the Cuban authorities. It should proceed to open negotiations on the conclusion of a cooperation agreement. Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has no such agreement. The European Union should support the funding of programmes in the humanitarian aid and infrastructure sectors. The recent natural disasters have created serious problems for the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union should take an immediate decision to integrate Cuba into the Cotonou Agreement within the framework of relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Cuban people cannot suffer double punishment, both from the United States and from the European Union. If the fight for the defence of human rights and the building of a democratic society in Cuba is in fact an honest rather than an ostentatious fight, then the European Union should listen to the voice of European public opinion, of our people, and proceed to lift sanctions and develop relations and contacts with Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a fact. Another true fact is that the European Union has maintained a common position since 1996 which has produced no positive result whatsoever and which has made no contribution to improving the situation on the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Statements to the effect that those who do not agree, for example, with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or with the exiles in Miami, are on the side of Castro, are exactly the kind of things we have heard from the White House, saying that those who questioned the US position on Iraq were automatically allied with Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">They are poor arguments, devoid of content and entirely inconsistent with European political reality, with the way in which we in Europe have dealt with our relations with every other region of the world, where we have rejected the black and white approach, a dialogue between Saint Michael and Satan, and where we work in accordance with the specific reality, with political practice, with changes as they take place. We have done so in relation to Libya, in relation to Iran, in relation to Korea. We have done so in relation to other countries and we want to continue doing so with Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s position on Cuba cannot be based on a gut reaction or an instinctive rejection of the political reality of Cuba or the figure of Fidel Castro. The European Union’s policy on Cuba must be born of reason, as is the case with so many other places, and must take account of the real needs of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution to be voted on tomorrow, if voted for in its original version, prohibits the Council from modifying or even reconsidering the position on Cuba until Cuban jails have been emptied. We would like to empty Cuban jails of political prisoners and we would like political freedom in Azerbaijan and in Ukraine and in Belarus and in Sudan, and in China as well. But we know that this is far from pragmatic and inconsistent with the political realism with which we in Europe can act and which has produced many results in many parts of the world. We would also like the fanaticism of certain people to be replaced with pragmatic thinking so that we can really move towards the peaceful transition in Cuba that some people are doing everything they can to prevent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are in Europe, and we must speak about Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it quite right that the European Union should change its attitude towards Cuba, because our current position is entirely subservient to US Government pressure. Europe would in this way signal its independence, its autonomy – which does not mean conflict with the United States, but actually means autonomy and independence of judgment in international affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is talk of the fight against terrorism, of the fight for human rights, but there is a question that I should like to ask. Why is it that in any part of the world someone who hijacks a ship or an aeroplane is called a terrorist, whereas someone who does the same in Cuba is called a defender of freedom or a dissident? Why are there double standards when one speaks of Cuba and when one speaks of Iraq?

Cuba is not an ‘animal farm’, to use the title of a book by George Orwell, nor is it Fidel Castro’s ‘farm’. During yesterday’s one-minute speeches, it was said that Members of this House should not travel to Cuba on EU money, but that is not the issue at stake. We must stand firm and continue to call on the Cuban regime to respect human rights, and we must be rigorous in demanding the release of political prisoners. We should not, however, create additional barriers and obstacles. If we isolate Cuba, Castro is most likely to benefit, not the opposition. According to Human Rights Watch, Castro is not suffering under the US embargo, but the Cuban people as a whole most certainly are.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eighth Session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will begin next Saturday in the Netherlands, and in view of this I should like to note that 77 of the countries that are Members of the Assembly believe that relations with Cuba should be stepped up, not scaled down. We would do well to fight for human rights, and we should do so effectively. Sometimes, even if our intentions are good and we defend the correct values, we may unintentionally cause harm to the people of Cuba and assist those who order them to chant ‘socialism or death!’ I hope the decision taken on Cuba by the EU’s 25 Foreign Affairs Ministers in December will be realistic and that it will defend human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it has had the recent good fortune of Mr Zapatero's new socialist government coming to power in Spain. Mr Zapatero seems keen to cosy up to Castro, aided and abetted – shamefully – by the British, Italian and French Governments, which have decided to try to change the tough policy of ostracising the Castro regime and regularly inviting Cuban dissidents to EU embassy functions. This was done last year in protest, after Mr Castro imprisoned 75 dissidents and human rights activists and executed three ferry highjackers fleeing the island. Castro has recently expelled visiting European MPs and NGO workers keen to engage with dissidents under the Varela Project.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of Prime Minister Blair, as a close friend of President Bush, who is tough on Cuba, is a bit of a mystery, unless it is some shabby deal cut over Gibraltar, which is thankfully off the agenda in Madrid right now.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time the Cuban Government has been able to blame all the country's woes on the American embargo. That is why our resolution supports lifting it. I am not sure that will help, as lifting it might relieve the increasing economic hardship, worsened by Castro's stupidity in recently banning the dollar for trading purposes as a response to tighter travel restrictions by the US on Cuban exiles visiting their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Oswaldo Payá, our Sakarov Prize winner, is still denied the right to visit the European Parliament, but he has written a letter to President Borrell, urging the EU to stand firm on its common European position for as long as the authorities continue their violations of fundamental rights, which included a disgraceful lack of adequate medical care for Cuban prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the resolve of countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have been used to the tyranny of communism and have stood firm on any relaxation of the current arrangements. No doubt when the ailing tyrant finally passes away many in this House will sing his praises as the historic father of the nation, as they have recently done sycophantically on the death of President Arafat. I, however, will regard the departure of President Castro as a fresh chance to build a prosperous and democratic Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was in Cuba recently with colleagues on an ad hoc delegation. I saw for myself the enormous potential of that country – a potential unrealised at present as a result, among other things, of the US sanctions and the current situation with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Commissioner Nielson that we need a constructive EU policy towards Cuba. Others in this House do not seem to have been listening. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra is not listening to me now, but he said a few moments ago that we should stand firm in demanding freedom. Mrs Malmström said that the Cubans have a right to democracy. Do they believe that people on this side of the House do not believe in human rights? They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on. We have made it clear that we do believe in human rights. No one in this House has ever defended the death penalty. However, we have to be realistic. After 45 years, changes will not come quickly. Some people in this House will also argue that we should never talk to political opponents if we disagree fundamentally with their political and military tactics. Where has that ever got anyone? Can anyone think of an example where that has improved the situation? I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work. I could respond to Mr Tannock's rather pathetic remarks, but it belittles this debate to bring in all sorts of other issues when we are talking about Cuba. I would remind Mr Tannock and others, when they are looking for parallels or examples around the world, that in different circumstances the UK Government never got anywhere with the Irish situation until we were prepared to enter into very difficult negotiations with our political opponents, people with whom we disagreed fundamentally. That is the only way we are going to achieve peace in the Middle East. We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba. That is why I would argue that we need an exchange of ideas in order to promote change.</p>
<p class="contents">The present EU policy, founded on the issue of who is invited to summer parties – or not – does not help Cuba or Europe, and needs to be changed. I urge Members to think very carefully and support a sensible and realistic compromise text that will move the EU forward, will help Cuba and will help the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was adopted as a punishment to society, following the statements made last year by a group of 75 protesters fighting for the freedom to express their opinions. The law allows the Internet to be accessed only from selected businesses and government offices. It should also be noted that in 2002 the government placed a ban on the sale of computers to the public, making this year’s law merely one more in a series of measures aimed at protesters and independent journalists. Cuba and its left-wing allies all over the world constantly present us with the myth of the revolutionary event that took place several decades ago, when the corrupt Batista government was overthrown. Are we to allow this myth to blind us to the reality of life in the modern police state of Cuba, to the imprisonment, repression and persecution suffered by those who merely desire liberty and basic civil freedoms?</p>
<p class="contents">As citizens of a part of Europe that was occupied by Russia and its Communist allies for decades, we know how much meaning a small gesture of solidarity by the free world can have for activists campaigning on behalf of those who have been imprisoned and persecuted because of their views. We know from our own experience that the only thing anti-democratic regimes take any notice of is firmness and consistency, and that all the efforts of such regimes are directed towards breaking international solidarity with human rights defenders. This is the very reason why we must not disengage ourselves. Measures we can and should take as EU Member States include diplomatic sanctions and support for those who defend civil rights. It is also important to speak out on their behalf in the international arena. My message to those who thoughtlessly carry round gadgets bearing images of Che Guevara is merely that they should add to them the slogan ‘Cuba yes, we’re starting afresh’. The dissidents charged with conspiring against Cuba’s independence and territorial integrity were actually imprisoned simply because they exercised their fundamental rights in a peaceful manner. It should be noted that the number of those suffering persecution has increased and decreased in proportion to the level of pressure exerted by other countries, and also in proportion to the extent of Fidel Castro’s international interests. The current escalation is a step backwards for human rights in Cuba, and it is therefore crucially important that international support for Cuban democrats be reiterated, and that diplomatic sanctions be kept in place against the regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

External pressures are mounting, while internally there has been a relative worsening of the situation for freedom of expression and more generally for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, the European Union must take up a clear position, without waiting for further events. What is Europe’s objective? It is proper to ask ourselves this question, because there are those who, especially in the United States, are hoping for a traumatic collapse of the regime, based on a hegemonic vision that has not altered substantially ever since the embargo was imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I must say that it is difficult to see what dynamic vision the ruling classes of Cuba now have for the future of their nation after the end of the cold war. All told, one can see a stalemate, caused by political immobilism both at home and abroad. In this situation, I believe that the Union cannot simply entrench itself behind the question of human rights, or, worse still, line up behind those who would use it as a political jemmy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of examples to show that what applies to Cuba does not apply in equal measure to many other countries. The recent European Union–ASEAN summit, with the full participation of Burma, perfectly encapsulates the double standard that operates on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Even today, in this Chamber, when Commissioner Patten was speaking on the subject of the arms embargo on China, he stated that the Commission has never established a direct link between a possible lifting of the embargo and human rights policy. He did clarify, however, and quite rightly, that further progress in the field of human rights could make a change in Europe’s attitude easier.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, I do not see why the same pragmatic attitude, based on a positive and motivational approach – and not simply one that is sanctions-based and punitive – cannot also be applied to Cuba. As we all know from experience, in the era of globalisation, helping to break Cuba’s isolation through greater economic cooperation would not fail to have positive repercussions on its internal politics, beginning precisely with human rights. Only those who look to the future with the eyes of the past, anticipating ideological revenge, can ignore this simple truth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union needs to change gear. We need more imagination and a new and autonomous policy towards Cuba. A more advanced and intense phase of political dialogue and cooperation must be opened up, which fully involves not only governments but also civil society in all its facets. We need to clear the path to a peaceful, negotiated transition towards a fully democratic and pluralistic change, and affirm the notion of a Cuban road to democracy. These must now be the objectives of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those sanctions – I would remind certain confused Members – were not implemented by the ‘hordes’ of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but during the Greek Socialist Government’s Presidency of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the Castro regime done over the last year to be thrown such an unexpected and generous lifeline? The answer is simple: nothing. Or rather it has imprisoned and tortured more opponents and isolated the Cuban population even further, moving them further away from our dream: a free and democratic Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to give up on that dream and I know that many members of other groups in this Parliament, including the Socialist Group, will not do so either. This Parliament has always been a model and a pioneer in defence of human rights and at this critical time it must demonstrate that it will not throw in its lot with a corrupt dictator in full decline nor be carried along by the collaborationism of certain Members who have always been manipulated by that dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic model of co-existence on the island and the hope of a peaceful political transition which will give Cuba and its people the important role on the international stage they have always deserved must win out today. In order to achieve that aim, it is essential that all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Castro’s jails be released immediately, that the torture and execution of dissidents cease immediately, that there be free dialogue amongst all the parties and the recognition by the regime that it is they who are isolated rather than the brave people of Cuba who are calling for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on all my fellow Members to share this dream with me and I hope that we will all wake up one day soon to a free Cuba in control of its own destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can we not take this opportunity – it would appear not – to come together and think solely of the Cuban people, of their present and their future, rather than make the issue an excessively ideological one and exploit it for party political purposes?</p>
<p class="contents">What are the aspirations of the Cuban people? I believe we would all agree that their aspiration is to overcome the immense deficiencies they suffer in both the economic field and in the field of freedoms and civil, social and political rights. I believe their aspiration is to have the hope of a better future, to begin, sooner rather than later, an ordered and peaceful democratic transition to bring reconciliation to all Cubans, those living in Cuba and those in exile. I believe they would like the Europeans not to fight amongst ourselves – as we are doing here tonight – but rather to unite to help them as much as possible, because they must be the masters of their future, not us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our differences today relate to the common position adopted by the European Union in 1996. Some governments and some honourable Members propose reforming it; others propose not changing a thing, but both are legitimate positions, there are arguments for both, and they do not mean that one side are lackeys of the United States and the others are accomplices of Fidel Castro. Let us leave aside this type of argument, as the previous speaker said.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, after eight years, the common position deserves evaluation and a possible but consensual reform, with a very broad, practically unanimous, agreement in the Council, which allows us to explore new positions on Cuba which are more effective but in no way provide a lifeline for the Cuban dictatorship and which in no way undermine the dissidents, the opposition or the political prisoners, many of whom are suffering dreadfully in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">If the huge majority of this House is convinced that in Cuba there is a totalitarian dictatorship and an oppressed people who deserve our help and if we agree on the need to end the damaging US embargo and that dialogue between governments is a valid instrument, why are we going to find it so difficult to agree on a policy on Cuba? As you will understand, however, I am very sceptical, given our debate tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, as a parliament, absolutely condemn the human rights situation in the country and the lack of free speech. However, that is not to say that the situation is all bad. On a recent visit to the country we found that schools, where there is a ratio of 15 pupils to one teacher, are the envy of Europe. The humanitarian work of educating doctors to transform health services in developing countries is not a case of talking about solidarity with Africa, but acting on solidarity with Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, relations between the EU and Cuba are at an all-time low. There has been no high-level contact between the governments of the EU and Cuba for over a year. The situation came about as a result of the EU pursuing sanctions against Cuba for a crackdown on dissidents in 2003. The sanctions came in the form of an invitation to Cuban dissidents to attend Member States' national day celebrations, alongside government representatives in Cuba. This action clearly infuriated the Cubans. They were the ones who cut off contact.</p>
<p class="contents">My appeal tonight is that we should be consistent in our approach to human rights. By all means condemn human rights violations in Cuba, but do the same in China. If you are to impose these kinds of sanctions on Cuba, then impose them on China as well. I feel that the EU strategy relating to Cuba is to spread an incredible degree of naivety. Did we really think that we could shift the human rights agenda in Cuba by inviting a few dissidents to a party when 40 years of US embargo have failed? We need to adopt alternative strategies to push the human rights agenda. The current method is not working.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr White argued for the freeing of all dissidents in Cuba. What about Spain? Do you want to free all dissidents in Spain as well? I will not be lectured to by the Spanish PPE on visiting Cuba when the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, was swanning around Havana last week. It is time that you and Mr Tannock got over losing the elections. Get over it and stop imposing your stupid obsessions on the rest of the European Parliament! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental question we should be asking ourselves, though, is how we can best achieve this, how we can best help the Cuban people. Is it by rejecting dialogue with the Cuban authorities, and thus with a large majority of civil society? I do not think so. Yet that, today, is the reality of the situation on the ground. Since the channels of communication with the Europeans have been closed, the EU’s common position has produced no satisfactory results. An assessment is therefore in order, provided it is a rational one, and the common position may need to be adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, along with a few other MEPs, I recently visited Cuba, and we were able to witness for ourselves a number of positive developments concerning education, for example, or health care. We ought to tell them this and we also ought to tell them that there are many aspects in Cuba we do not like at all, but at least we ought to strike up a dialogue, like we do with other countries including China, Saudi Arabia or Vietnam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One Member mentioned that we should do more on humanitarian aid: this is not part of the political equation. We provide humanitarian aid in reaction to need, and provide it where that need is, without considering politics. This point is very important, and it is important that I take the time to repeat our position. We are in Cuba when needed for humanitarian reasons, as in all other places including North Korea etc. I am quite sure that this is not up for discussion here. I am not saying this because I feel it is a real problem in this House, but because it is important never to make that mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">I tend to agree with those who have said that the common position has not produced any results. The problem is, however, what other instruments are available that will produce results? It is not easy and the risk of being disappointed is always present. As I see it there is an ongoing struggle between hardliners and more constructive, open-minded people in the leadership in Havana. This moves back and forth in an unpredictable manner and is a reaction both to internal events and a reaction to the pressure from Cuba's big neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to do more than putting our rhetoric on autopilot – referring to basic principles of human rights and so on. I do not think this discussion is necessary in Parliament. I do not see this Parliament as a place where we should have a discussion for or against human rights. This really is not the place. If we are serious about it we have to be pragmatic. The other approach is the easy one and we have to get into the game, we have to get closer to the real politics of change and progress in Cuba if possible. Nobody can give any guarantees. In 2003 I attempted to see what could be done and I was disappointed. However, this was a reaction resulting, in my view, from the very unpredictable inner circles in Havana.</p>
<p class="contents">Another frustration that we run into in Europe again and again is that, whenever it is attractive to do so, it is a fashion in Cuba to put us in the same category as the US. It makes it very easy – even convenient – for hardliners in Havana to do this, supporting their view – driven by paranoia – that the whole world is against them. This is wrong, Europe is not against Cuba and definitely not against the Cubans. We do not like the regime, we do not like the old fashioned dictatorial way of managing a society, but we also do not want to be associated with the way in which the United States conducts its relationship with its neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is different; our thinking concerning Cuba is different and we have to pay some sort of investment to make this an inescapable reality in the internal discussions in Havana. For our part, we have to be willing to have some element of risk to make it impossible for the hardliners to portray Europe as if Europe and the US are the same thing. That is the investment we must be courageous, constructive and self-assured enough to make. If we are not ready to make an investment to create a real basis for a dialogue – one that is defined by us and not by a paranoid representation of the way the hardliners in Havana see the outside world – we are only relying on autopilot-defined rhetoric or, in other words, the old common position.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not make it a straitjacket. Please remember that for a number of years the very same common position did not prohibit Europe from engaging in a bolder, closer and more critical dialogue on human rights with Cuba. We did that against the same background in terms of the common position. European investment in the Cuban economy also grew remarkably while we held the same common position. It did not make investment growth impossible. We should not interpret it in such a narrow sense that it becomes a straitjacket. In conclusion, there is a need for a more innovative approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
