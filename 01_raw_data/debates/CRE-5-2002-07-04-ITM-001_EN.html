<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the positive steps taken in the legislative area to promote equality between men and women, many shortcomings, inequalities and forms of discrimination still remain in the differing practices of the States Members, which must be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption in 2000 of the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women and of the respective Community action programme for 2001 to 2005, there has been an effort to involve all Community policies and all Commission departments in this strategy, which has already produced some positive practical results. We need to go further, however. It is unacceptable, for example, that the Community institutions themselves, including the European Convention now running, comprise less than 20% women, in other words, an even lower percentage than that of the previous Convention drafting the Charter on Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important that the implementation of the guidelines, directives, recommendations and resolutions aimed at the promotion of equality by the various Member States be monitored decisively in order to ensure that the decisions taken in the sphere of policy on equality of rights and opportunities are better implemented and that they are also effectively applied in national equal rights and opportunities policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, therefore, with regard to the objective set at the Lisbon Council of ensuring that 60% of women are part of the active population by 2010, it is reaffirmed that this target will only contribute to equality of opportunities for men and women if the majority have quality and properly paid jobs, stressing the importance of various forms and methods of training, and the establishment of a sufficient number of facilities for the care of children and dependent persons and by promoting diversification of the career choices open to girls.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence also the importance of the implementation of the Council recommendation of 31 March 1992. It is not enough for the Commission to say that it adopted the report on this implementation on 4 February 1998. Four years have now passed and we need to know the current state of play, focusing on the importance of establishing common indicators as regards childcare structures and the disparity in wages and other forms of income between men and women, by sector, with regard inter alia to atypical forms of work and part-time work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important to insist on the conclusion of research on the causes and means adopted and to be adopted by the various Member States in order to combat the disparity in wages which still exists (of around 15% to 20%), despite the 1975 directive on equal treatment as regards pay. Precise quantitative and temporal objectives must also be included in the employment guidelines, which are already in the process of being revised, and the Commission must submit a report on the matter, specifically on the measures to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an urgent need to establish goals to be achieved in realistic and measurable stages in the fields of intervention envisaged in the Community framework strategy on gender equality, in order to ensure real practical progress in all areas, bearing in mind that there are still many infringements of legislation on equal treatment between men and women. With regard to the new directive being prepared on gender equality in sectors other than employment opportunities and which the Commission promised to submit before June, this must not be subject to any further delay. We must also insist on making improvements in line with other existing directives, specifically those concerning the safety and health at work of women who are pregnant, or have recently given birth or are breastfeeding and the equal treatment of men and women in legal and professional social security schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The central issue is the need to work for the integration of the prospect of equality between men and women in economic guidelines, not least in the accession process, with a view to preventing any<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>adverse effects on gender equality of the processes of privatisation, liberalisation and cuts in public expenditure in the social sectors, and we must reaffirm that quality public services are essential, and call for an increase in the budget allocation in the social sphere in order to prevent social exclusion and to combat trafficking in women.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to thank everyone who worked on drafting this report, and I am convinced that the success of the fight for equal opportunities for men and women, not least in political life and in decision-making bodies, depends also on the greater involvement and political will of us all, both men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to continue with this work and to insist that the programme is complied with; we must be familiar with the data and possess better information on the implementation of the programme. It would be very helpful to our work if the data were given for each country. That is something we have asked for many times and which is crucial if the work is to be based on real data and if it is to be more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report states, it is also important to achieve the objectives proposed at the Lisbon European Council, for women to represent 60% of the active population, not forgetting the significant number of women who work in small family-owned businesses, with no recognition of any kind for their work and with no social protection. That is a problem we should address in the near future, as the number of women in this situation in areas such as agriculture, fishing and small companies is highly significant. These are specific gender-related problems which arise in various fields, but which are extremely important. This report calls for a solution to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender is also very important in terms of social exclusion and poverty. We should therefore welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency has included this in its programme in order to be able to make progress in solving these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I also genuinely hope that the proposal for a directive on equality based on Article 13 of the Treaty will be presented here. I also hope that the establishment of the Institute for Equality between men and women, which I am pleased to see the feasibility report has already approved, will not be postponed.</p>

It effectively outlines the actions taken by the Commission and the strategy adopted. During a meeting of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities of this Parliament in April, Commissioner Diamantopoulou explained this strategy once again in the penetrating and convincing manner that is so characteristic of her. We very much appreciated the dialogue that was initiated at the time. I should particularly like to mention the initiative to develop policy within the gender dimension of foreign policy. The Commissioner might be able to inform us of the latest on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, it should be mentioned in my view that the European Commission is currently ahead in the way it tackles gender mainstreaming. Many a Member State, but also the European Parliament, could take a leaf out of its book.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to single out a number of elements from the report by Mrs Figueiredo that is before us.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to turn my attention to paragraph 3 of her report, the issue of the so-called ‘Gender Institute’, which is, by the way, a strange term on which we should be able to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">We learnt about the feasibility study on the subject of an Institute which collates and disseminates information, supports networks, and so on. In short, it fulfils a broker role, and the implication is that it could be useful to give women's issues a more political dimension in Europe and to support the professional content of our work. My question to the Commission is whether it shares this idea and would like to develop this further. Above all, would it like to ask Parliament for advice on this and if so, what is the timeframe it envisages? I am of the opinion that there are many people in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities who are keen on the idea of an Institute, but would first like to see more concrete plans on the table before they can give their final verdict. My question is therefore: will the Commission produce such a plan?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question pertains to paragraph 5. Can the Commission give assurances that it will draft a political analysis of the state of implementation by the Member States of the equal treatment <span class="italic">acquis</span> and of its intentions to amend this legislation, if necessary, or to start treaty inbox procedures?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to echo the request already made by Mrs Avilés Perea, and ask when the Commission will now finally produce its draft directive on equal treatment for which we have been waiting an awfully long time? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outcome is not of course dependent upon the Commissioner for Equality alone. It is dependent to the very highest degree upon the whole of the Commission, and I am completely convinced that, in our present Commissioner, we have an extremely good spokesperson for equality. It is not so easy to get a programme such as this accepted, and the reason for that is clear enough, there being only five female Commissioners out of a total of twenty. We are all aware, then, that we are under the critical threshold for getting things through, so there is cause for thanking the Commissioner for being so indefatigable. If we are to criticise anyone, it is in any case not our Commissioner. Rather, it is the men in the Commission to whom we should be addressing our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the brilliant report she has presented here. I think, in general, that it is one of our very major tasks to continue to keep these issues on the agenda. The EU is a political project which therefore applies to both men and women. For that reason, it is important that we always be careful to involve the other half of the population, namely women. That being said, we must of course also distinguish between matters to which the principle of subsidiarity should apply and those which are matters of overarching concern. In common with previous rapporteurs, I would also enquire after the Equality Institute. It is becoming ever more obvious that we shall have a shortage of data if there is a lack of people, for example in the EU, who are able to collect, and so coordinate, national data. Then, there is the issue of subsidiarity, which is also mentioned in the report in connection with important areas, such as childcare arrangements, in which efforts need to be made. Without such efforts, women will not be able to enter the labour market. This is an area to which I still regard the principle of subsidiarity as applying. It is an area in which we can merely point to best practice and, in reality, only issue exhortations about rather than enter directly into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what is a very comprehensive and fair balance of criticism for the shortcomings in the Commission's work, praise for the achievements of the work programme and also constructive suggestions for work in the future. The support that the report received in committee was a reflection of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are only too aware, as other speakers have said, that we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality within the EU institutions, as well as in society as a whole. We could not have a clearer reflection of this than the make-up of the Convention on the future of Europe. Only 16% of the members are women on a body which is directly involved in planning the whole future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This report addresses the means of achieving gender equality in the labour market, employment, decision-making, social inclusion, lifelong learning, health and so on. The rapporteur has addressed these issues in a very focused way and gives very clear guidelines to the Commission on the kind of measures that Parliament would like to see adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of actions for 2002, I would particularly like to welcome the Commission's commitment to providing gender-specific data, gender progress indicators and gender impact assessments in policy areas that have not yet been mainstreamed. We know that this information is essential when forming and assessing equality legislation. Time and time again in reports and opinions we have condemned the lack of appropriate data on which to base our analyses. This has to be addressed now, as other speakers have said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention some of the new Commission proposals noted in this report, such as the conference on rural women to be held in October. This is extremely important given the crisis that many of our rural areas have suffered, particularly in the past 18 months and the specific needs of women who live and work in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality in foreign policy and international relations is again a vital issue. The proposed conference could not only draw attention to this but give us a better understanding of its significance in all of our international work. As Mrs Avilés Perea said, gender should be central to the round-table discussion on social exclusion and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The work programme for 2002 is more developed and ambitious than this year and hopefully on the basis of this report we can make significant progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must start by saying that I fully share the regret expressed by other female colleagues at the sadly symbolic, worrying fact that, despite the many good intentions expressed, of the members of the European Convention planning the future of Europe and therefore the future of the rights of European citizens – both men and women – only 16% are women, which I feel is a genuinely disturbing figure. Nevertheless, it is worth calling strongly for the achievement of a number of fundamental objectives, strongly underscored in the report, which would help to secure more tangible and, above all, better opportunities for European women.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring, in the first place, to the need for an evaluation report to be drawn up assessing compliance by the Member States with all the legislative texts adopted – resolutions, recommendations and directives – in order to assess regularly the extent to which these texts are being implemented by the Member States and, if necessary, instigate any appropriate infringement proceedings in the event of failure to transpose or respect them. This would enable us to keep the situation more under control, making the Member States accountable and taking more effective measures to secure all the conditions necessary for a more balanced participation of women both in the work place and in government, while attempting, moreover, to promote a responsible social assistance policy for working women – in other words, facilities for the care of children and dependent persons – so as to make it genuinely possible for women to reconcile professional and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons I have attempted briefly to outline, our group will vote for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report shows that much is left to be desired in terms of practical application one and a half years after the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women came into effect. Action in the areas of social rights, economic life and participation and representation has produced nothing in the way of positive outcomes, as the difference in income between women and men in the private sector is still around 25%. Only 23% of entrepreneurs are women. The proportion of women involved in decision-making processes scarcely reaches 30% in most countries, and the institutions of the European Union, with women represented in between 13% and 30% of positions, are not exactly the best of examples. We have already heard how the composition of the Convention plays its part in this. If we are to make demands of the Member States, we should be going on ahead and setting the best possible example.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are the EU's existing directives on the equality of men and women in need of improvement, they also need to be better transposed in the Member States. This also means better monitoring by the Commission, so that equality will work; otherwise, it strikes me as nothing but a farce if directives exist and we are constantly having to check to see that progress is being made with their implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to comment on some of the issues discussed which are especially important but on which no headway has been made. Several lady members referred to the question of infrastructures and childcare and care for all those who, in many cases, are dependent on their family. Of course this is an issue for the Member States alone but there is always room, not for intervention, but for help from the Commission and cooperation at European level in order to achieve added value. So may I remind you of what has been done so far: first, the strategy on employment contains one of the four approaches to gender equality. It focuses mainly on the question of infrastructures and provides important funding for several Member States. Last year, following our evaluation of the implementation of the strategy on employment, 8 of the 15 Member States were specifically advised that they needed to improve their childcare facilities. Although there are a few exceptions, most Member States refuse to set quantitative targets which would be easy to monitor. Nonetheless, we have seen a net improvement year on year under the strategy on employment. The second issue is statistical monitoring; again this has not exactly been a success at European level. We are now working closely with Eurostat so that, with the new manpower research, childcare will also be included in the statistics. The definition has been discussed at length, the situation is not the same in all the Member States, but I feel that it is very important for these data to be included in the official statistics, together with the question of gender-related pay differentials.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue raised by a number of honourable Members is the Institute. I have been asked if I agree with it. We have, I think, discussed this issue in committee on numerous occasions. Of course I think we need this Institute. As you know, we commissioned a study and have already received the results; we have scientific confirmation of the need for this Institute and an initial estimate of its budgetary requirements and financial conditions and I have already been in correspondence with the President. I would remind you, if I may, of the overall difficulties inherent in setting up a new institution. I put this question to the last Council of Employment Ministers and I must say that several countries reacted positively and supported the need to set up this Institute. The rest expressed no opinion whatsoever. No Member State has yet spoken out against the Institute. I should like to reassure you that I for one shall be taking decisive action to bring about a final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">A third issue raised was the application of legislation in the Member States. Here, as with other issues, such as the job market and the entire legal framework on working conditions, the Commission has objective difficulties in monitoring the application of legislation. It does not have the mechanisms it needs in order to monitor what is happening on the ground in the Member States. So it works at two levels. At one level, which I would call the relatively easy level, it checks that the Member States have adopted the legislative framework needed and have done so properly while, at the second level, the Commission takes immediate action, using every means of recourse to the Court available, if it receives reports that the law is not being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment refers to planning for 2002 in general. I think we have made significant progress, especially on how we operate. This year, all the planning dossiers will take account of gender equality ex ante, at the programming stage, not ex post, during evaluation. Secondly, we are still collecting gender-based data at all levels, which is helping enormously in developing indicators and, thirdly, one of the priorities which we set in motion this year is special staff training on gender equality in all the Directorates-General, especially for anyone involved in planning and programming.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last two years' working together, we have made significant progress in the legislative sector, our crowning achievement being the recent agreement on legislation on gender equality. This establishes a very important basis and will be a huge help with the new proposal on gender equality in all sectors based on Article 13.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one political comment. I think this is a very important and very hard-hitting directive, which is why we are making every effort to ensure the text is as well processed and substantiated as possible, so that it will help the debate move in the right direction right from the start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
