The abolition of the death penalty belongs, as it were, to our culture. Unfortunately, however, we did not see the abolition of the death penalty in the UN in 1999. We all know that the death penalty is still on the agenda in Iran, Turkey, China and Yemen. I find it particularly tragic that America, the land which champions freedom and human rights, has maintained the death penalty. At the moment, two European Union citizens are on death row, a Spaniard in Yemen and an Italian in the USA, a Mr Barnabei, who is due to be executed in the year 2000. Mr Barnabei, who was previously a respectable man, is accused of having killed a young woman. This is my cause for concern insofar as, like me, he is an Italian citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission and, of course, this Parliament, to do everything it can to get this death sentence commuted to life imprisonment or postponed, not just because leading American legal experts have indicated that there may be a miscarriage of justice, as is often the case, but also because he is an EU citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are talking about the sentencing of two European citizens, a Spaniard and an Italian, who have been condemned to death, as has already been said, in Yemen and the United States respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Spanish citizen, Nabil Nanakli, furthermore, there is no sufficient information regarding the trial, arrest and current situation of the prisoner, which has mobilised the entire Muslim community.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stated in this House that they is no such thing as a just death penalty, that no human being may condemn to death or execute another human being, that there is no recourse to any law, to any sovereignty, to the independence of any State, which can justify this violation of life itself. The defence of human rights is at the very heart of our Union. To globalise the respect for human rights must be our prime objective. I am not making – and this Parliament is not once again making – a humanitarian declaration. It is a political commitment, it is Politics with a capital ‘P’, and it is the European Union’s foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to draw attention to point 5 of our Resolution, which says that we repeat our request to the Council to incorporate into negotiations with third countries – with all of them – “the abolition of the death penalty as part of the human rights clause”. We expect a response from the Council in this respect; a response and a commitment which is also political.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a book which has been published to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Council of Europe, a book whose title reads “Europe, all of us under the same roof”. Let us be ambitious, let us extend the European roof, let us extend our civilisation, let us put into practice a phrase which, fortunately, this book quotes. In the words of Albert Camus: “Neither in people’s hearts nor in the customs of society will there be peace while the death penalty remains legal”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are opposed to deaths caused by man’s interference, such as abortion and euthanasia. </p>
<p class="contents">A guilty verdict is irrelevant to this request. We would ask for this moratorium even if the person were a confessed criminal and there is all the more reason for us to do it<span class="bold"> </span>when there may be reasonable doubt about their guilt. If, on the basis of formal documents on civil rights, we ask for humane conditions in prisons, there is all the more reason for us to oppose the death penalty and we cannot therefore understand how countries that are recognised as civilised can still have cruel and uncivilised regulations. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that, taking the modern view of studying the consequences of criminal judgements, the punishment should fulfil a rehabilitative function, enabling the citizen who has done wrong to take up his place in civil society again. Knowing these values, we are firmly reasserting our request for a moratorium on capital punishment for the two condemned citizens in Virginia and the Yemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How many others are in the same position? How many others, like him, do not have the necessary funds to pay for lawyers or the expensive analyses which could, perhaps, completely exonerate them? </p>

<p class="contents">In Kuwait, at the end of November, the parliament rejected the proposal to recognise a woman’s right to vote or to stand for election with 32 votes against and 30 votes in favour. This is not only a violation of human rights for women and an abhorrent political act but, paradoxically enough, it is an infringement of the Constitution of Kuwait, Article 29 of which stipulates that “all citizens are equal before the law, regardless of gender, religion, race or ethnic background”. What is more, Kuwait is a signatory to the UN’s International Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. It appears that the members of the Legislative Assembly – all men of course – are not bound by the country’s Constitution or by laws or international obligations, or by the political will of the leadership of the country which submitted the relevant decree for adoption. However, this decision, apart from its antiquated misogynistic and deeply antidemocratic nature, is a clear message of resistance against any attempts to modernise and democratise the country. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Parliament needs to send a strong message of support and solidarity to the women of Kuwait who are fighting for their fundamental rights. We also call upon the representative of the National Assembly to make all possible efforts to review the issue and to restore justice for women so that by the next elections in 2003, the women of Kuwait will have full political rights to vote and to stand for election. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dr Rasha Al-Sabah, the long-serving Under-Secretary of Higher Education, is joined by Dr Fayezah Al-Khorafi, President of the University of Kuwait; Her Excellency Nabila Al-Mulla, who is Ambassador of the State of Kuwait to Austria; Siham Ruzuqi, the Assistant Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Oil; another Assistant Under-Secretary: Sarah Duwaisan at the Ministry of Planning; and in civil society: Shaikha Hussah Al-Salim Al-Mubarek Al-Sabah, the President of Dar Al-Athar Al-Islamiya, the Islamic Museum of Kuwait.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising with this record of achievement of highly able women in Kuwait that, on 16 May 1999, His Highness the Prince of the State of Kuwait issued an official decree giving the Kuwaiti woman the right of voting and of nomination to parliament, but it is parliament who has turned this down. Despite this, the Kuwaiti Parliament is different from the other parliaments of the Arabian Gulf. The 50 Members of Parliament are directly elected, not nominated, not appointed as is the case in other Arab Gulf States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members of Parliament can question ministers in parliament at any time. That questioning can be so fierce that it can even lead to the resignation of ministers. Also, the parliament controls the government's annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there will be another vote before too long, perhaps within two or three months, because this is a democratically elected parliament. It is unthinkable that universal suffrage in a democracy will not be achieved in the end. As a parliamentarian, therefore, I call upon my fellow parliamentarians – here and in our national parliaments too – to urge Kuwaiti parliamentarians to give women that right to vote and stand. That is an historic step forward and one that I believe they will not regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It touches fundamental human rights. This right is also laid down in the Kuwaiti Constitution, as is stipulated in the resolution and it is, of course, commendable that the Kuwaiti government and parliament have implemented the same. It is, however, unfortunate, how this came about. The bill was not passed for two reasons. Firstly, it was not submitted correctly as the emir did this during recess and secondly, the rank and file did not subscribe to it, so there is also an issue with the rank and file. So the emir submitted the bill during recess. This is why MPs who agreed with the content voted against it out of protest against the procedure. The same was true for fifteen ministers who have voting rights in parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which forms part of the larger picture is mainly an issue to do with the local government officials. They are all men and they have shown little enthusiasm when it comes to women joining them in the local government. This is why the MPs have voted against, often for fear of their own rank and file – there is no party structure but people are elected directly – and for fear of their own positions. </p>
<p class="contents">Hence my plea, Mr President. If a clause is added to paragraph 4 in the resolution that a delegation is to go to Kuwait, then the issues of local government will also need to be addressed, as well as the procedural issue, because it is extremely awkward if such an important bill were not to be passed due to a procedural error. I look forward to a positive outcome to the vote on this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So, although the vote of the Kuwaiti National Assembly on 30 November to deny those very rights to women in Kuwait was a deep disappointment, it offers some hope for the future. The closeness of the vote in November has strengthened the resolve of the women and men in Kuwait who are working for this change in the law. They have pledged not to give up the campaign. They have set the 2003 general and municipal elections as their target for the first time that women will ever vote in Kuwait. They are going to put forward a women's rights bill every year in the National Assembly until they succeed in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">While we condemn the decision of the Kuwaiti National Assembly on 30 November it is also important for us to use our elected positions as parliamentarians to encourage and support those who want to bring about change. After all, it is not so long ago that women in many European Union countries were engaged in years of campaign and protest to win the right to vote and stand in elections. This was what brought about that change.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, for example, the suffrage movement was set up in 1860. It was not until 1918 that some women – not all – got the right to vote. It was not until 1928 that all women in the United Kingdom got the right to vote. So we have been through these campaigns before in other countries. If we look at an international level, by 1990 women had the right to vote in almost every country where men could vote as well. Only Kuwait extended the vote to men and not to women.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is difficult for most of us even to comprehend this kind of system, we have a responsibility to the people working there to support them in every way we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the whole world is aware of their situation and for this reason has supported this initiative. By defending their rights we also defend our own.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which we are debating today must be one more contribution to the ending of the situation of women in a country, Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime, through its authoritarianism, is causing terror throughout the population and international alarm. The public execution of Zaarmeena, the obligation to wear the <span class="italic">burka</span>, the denial of the right to healthcare and education for women are but a few examples of the flagrant violations of human rights committed in that country. Serious violations of women’s rights are committed every day, unpunished by a government which supports and encourages acts of repression and torture against them.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, the European Parliament, has the moral obligation to express its solidarity with the Afghan women, to request that the UN intervene more actively, to ask the Member States to continue to refuse to recognise the Taliban regime until it respects human rights and puts an end to its discrimination against women. The approval of this resolution may be a step – however small – in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Women currently make up 52% of the world population and, nevertheless, we are one of the groups which is most discriminated against and marginalised. The case of the Afghan women illustrates the problem of the lack of respect for human rights which takes place every day in all corners of the planet and also in this Europe of ours. We all know about the white slave trade, murders and abuse etc.. Perhaps there is little we can do from this House, but we have the duty to put pressure on the UN and the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While this morning a Member pointed out the fact that the three institutions of the European Union responsible for signing the budget were presided over by women and saw this as an illustration of what the third millennium may represent for the consolidation of equality of rights and opportunities for men and women, in Afghanistan we see how the Taliban regime not only denies women – millions of women – their most basic rights – such as rights to education, healthcare and a profession, not only does it commit violence against them for the mere fact of being women but, through the denial of these rights, it is also denying them the freedom to live their own lives, it is denying them their status as human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, which is always sensitive to the cause of human rights, cannot remain inactive in the face of the greatest violation of these rights: the systematic discrimination and violence which women are today suffering in Afghanistan of which the public execution of Zaarmeena is just one tragic example.</p>

We want to demand that the international community, in particular the United Nations, but also the European Union and its Member States, intervenes with all the means available to it, to put an end to the extreme discrimination suffered by Afghan women.

<p class="contents">Women have borne the brunt of tragedy in Afghanistan through years of war. They have suffered a multitude of human rights abuses: rape, sexual assault, forced marriages and prostitution. The intimidation of women has been used as a means of dishonouring and dehumanising entire communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Taliban regime took over in 1996, the plight of Afghan women has continued. A barbaric social code has been imposed, based on intimidation, humiliation and coercion of a female population that has been stripped of all its fundamental human rights. For Afghan women freedom of expression, freedom of employment, freedom to attend health and family-planning courses, access to education, all those things as we know them simply do not exist. Yet it was not until 15 October this year that the European Council took action on an air embargo and a freeze on funds to the Taliban. That was not as a result of the apartheid-style policies of the regime vis-à-vis women, but as the result of the Taliban protection of Mr Bin Laden. Nevertheless, I believe that this action should continue until the unacceptable discrimination against women in Afghanistan comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The first speaker put it very well in saying that this resolution can play a part in that process. It may be a small part, but we certainly have a responsibility as a Parliament to play some part in bringing this regime and its inhumane policies to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer is that, although discrimination against women has become a common problem in today’s world, the discrimination being experienced by women in Afghanistan is unique and without precedent. This is the explanation given by one of the courageous women who is standing up and telling the world about this abominable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore no doubt about the urgency of this issue and this has been the case since 1996. Terror and fanaticism have swept through Afghanistan since the arrival of the Taliban. Women are their bête noire and the hatred which they have unleashed against them is expressed in inhuman violence. All females, including young girls, are subject to a strict regime of segregation. They have no freedom of speech, no access to healthcare and no right to work. They are forced to cover themselves from head to toe which is like living in a walking prison. They can be beaten in the street simply for not covering their faces and hair correctly. In addition to physical cruelty, there is every evidence that almost all the women living in Afghanistan are subject to psychological pressures which are leading them to depression and suicide. This situation can only get worse because girls are not allowed to be educated beyond the age of nine. The direct consequences on all children are terrible for one child in five is dying before the age of five.</p>
<p class="contents">These conditions are even less acceptable given that, in the past, Afghan women participated in public life as students, professionals, officials or even parliamentarians. This treatment, which is impossible for a human being to even conceive, is not a religious issue or a question of cultural tradition, as some would have us believe. It is a barbaric system which forces women into a sub-human status. We must react against this apartheid. We must stop these fanatics who are greedy for power and secretly supported not only by the regime in Pakistan and its Koranic schools but also, unfortunately, by American services.</p>
<p class="contents">Several women’s organisations have been calling for some time for all the countries of the world to increase pressure on the Taliban. The UN and the European Union have rightly made their aid conditional on respect for human rights. As indicated in the motion for a resolution which, like Mrs Morgantini, I ask you to support en masse, I call on the Council not to recognise any regime in Afghanistan until sexual discrimination is eliminated. The Council must be more active and at least as active as it was with regard to Bin Laden. NGOs are also present in part of the country. We must help them and ensure that a proper action plan is implemented to support their work. We must also help the Afghan women who are in Europe organising themselves. They must receive our support and help.</p>

Djibouti's national assets are its port and its strategic position in the Horn of Africa. Western powers, including France, exploit its strategic position. Ethiopia uses its port. Trapped in the conflict between the Afars and the Issas and the problems of the neighbouring countries, and with the desires and strategic policies of countries which dominate its strategic position, it is caught in a situation where it is desperately poor and, of course, undemocratic.</p>
<p class="contents">The leader of Djibouti today is doing things that we absolutely abhor. The Afars' leader is in jail, without trial, with his supporters in abominable conditions. He is going blind. Such conditions exist in Djibouti today that we really have to look at our policy because it is part of Lomé, it receives aid from the EU and one of our Member States, France, is very strategically placed and has considerable influence in Djibouti.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of dictatorship, this sort of terror of civilians and abuse of resources by unnecessary expenditure on arms for a country of that size is totally inexcusable. It ought to be like the Singapore or Hong Kong of Africa. It should really be a very prosperous place. So I hope that you will all support this resolution condemning the abominable conditions of prisoners and civilians in Djibouti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through him, the Sakharov Prize honours the struggle of all those men and women throughout the world who are fighting for more justice, democracy and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am asking you to look closely at the attacks on human rights in Djibouti and specifically at the situation of the political prisoners. This is particularly justified given that, as already stated, many Member States have very close relations with Djibouti. Yesterday, several associations in France strongly protested when France again prepared to grant aid to this country.</p>
<p class="contents">You should know that for the last nine years the bulk of this country’s own budgetary resources has been devoted to financing the civil war. Wages and pensions have not been paid for seven months. Despite the previous resolutions of this House, reinforced by the International Federation of Human Rights League’s report confirming the precarious conditions of detention of the political prisoners, acts of violence, humiliation and attacks on the physical integrity of individuals are still standard practice in the prisons of Djibouti, particularly in Gabode Prison. Here in May, forty-five hunger strikers were refused access to medical care and some died. The families of prisoners are subject to constant pressure and threats. Women are raped and tortured. The army and police are carrying out military operations in the districts of Tadjoura and Obock and are subjecting the population in the north of the country to a suicidal food blockade.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that Djibouti is a signatory to the Lomé Convention which stipulates in Article 5 that aid for development is subject to respect for human rights. Nowadays, aid should also very definitely be subject to respect for freedom of thought and expression, fair trials, access for detainees to basic medical care and the requirement to return refugees and displaced persons to their region of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission must make every effort to ensure that Djibouti respects the conventions which it has signed. A peaceful political solution must be found as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is essential that our President forwards this motion for a resolution to the Council, the Commission and the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. This century started with the Great War and ended with terrifying images of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. I firmly hope that we will now be intransigent towards all these daily attacks on human rights, for it is these small acts of cowardice which lead to genocide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political prisoners are being held in terrible conditions for they are either packed into cramped cells or kept in isolation. Hygiene is totally lacking and they have no access to medical care. A tuberculosis epidemic has broken out on several occasions and two prisoners have already died due to lack of care. The political detainees have held hunger strikes to protest against the conditions of their detention and to demand access to medical care and their release in the absence of a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that most of the prisoners are being held in preventative detention without having been brought before the courts. Among the prisoners who are ill is Mohamed Kadamiousouf. He is the European representative of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy. He was illegally extradited from Ethiopia in 1997 and, in the absence of medical care, risks losing his sight. As respect for human rights constitutes an essential element of the cooperation and development between the European Union and the Republic of Djibouti, we demand, in accordance with these principles, the release of all political prisoners and access to medical care for all detainees. We particularly want emergency medical care to be given to Mohamed Kadamiousouf to prevent him losing his sight. We also demand a guarantee of freedom of expression and political pluralism which are essential for any democracy and the end to repression against opponents of the regime. Finally, we ask the Commission to use all the means in its power to ensure respect for human rights in Djibouti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with the representatives of the Member States in the Council and, if I have understood correctly, Commissioner Verheugen, we are in agreement with the European Commission. We have just learned that the ambassador of Nicaragua in Brussels has resigned because he no longer wishes to represent this government in Nicaragua following the incidents of the past week. Mr Agustín Jarquín is an upstanding democrat and has carried out his work as President of the Court of Auditors in a highly efficient and impartial manner. This view is shared not only by those of us who knew him personally, but also by his colleagues at other courts of auditors in Central America and the Caribbean who elected him as president of the OCCEFS. Even the representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the Interamerican Development Bank supported his appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously his work was too efficient for the liking of some members of the present and previous Nicaraguan government. The government has been systematically undermining the Court of Auditors over recent months. This undermining culminated in a pact concluded between the government and a previous governing party. This pact resulted in the abolition of the office of President of the Court of Auditors and the installation of a party-politically dominated committee. On 10 November this year, the former President of the Court of Auditors, Agustín Jarquín, was arrested on grounds which, in our view, do not, under any circumstances, constitute grounds for arrest.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the European Parliament in particular cannot accept the systematic undermining of the Court of Auditors. We in the European Parliament forced the European Commission to resign because it was unable to defend itself against accusations of the inefficient management of funds levied by the Court of Auditors and others in Europe. Imagine what would happen if the President of the Court of Auditors or a prominent representative of an auditing authority were thrown into jail on such flimsy grounds! I think the outcry would be enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as are aware, there is no cause for concern at the moment about Mr Jarquín’s health, but we shall monitor the situation closely to ensure that he is treated properly. We are particularly worried at reports that his family, and his daughter in particular, have been physically attacked. I would ask the Commission to monitor this very closely.</p>

Therefore, we do not accept any limitation of these values by criteria of national sovereignty or respect for geo-strategic balances. The establishment of international criminal courts, the refusal to allow crimes against humanity to lapse and the refusal to submit human rights policies to a state’s commercial interests are principles and objectives that we consider to be fundamental. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the possibility of a judicial trial is being used for political objectives deserves our concern and justifies particular attention in terms of the situation in Nicaragua. We feel, therefore, that the European Parliament must continue to follow this process and that if this suspicion is confirmed, by us or by reputable and credible human rights organisations, we will have to use the full weight of our force to end this situation. </p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, and in accordance with the principles for which we are fighting, we must be rigorous and cautious before casting doubts on what is a judicial decision by a sovereign state. On the other hand, our interference would not be justified by the way in which the system of politicians supporting their own interests and holding incompatible political posts is put into practice in Nicaragua. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot intervene on the basis of the popularity polls of the various Presidential candidates and in relation to the main electoral issues under discussion in a sovereign state on which Nicaragua’s voters will soon pass judgement and on which they, and only they, have the right to do so. With regard to this, we would like to know what your reaction would be if we proposed a resolution requiring an ex-Prime Minister of a Member State to declare his income with regard to commissions received for arms deals, on the basis of opinion polls and bypassing the institutions of that country. </p>
<p class="contents">It would make more sense to pass this kind of resolution on a Member State of the European Union than on a third country, but even in that case, it would constitute an attack on the functioning of that state’s institutions and on the ability of its citizens to resolve the problem internally. This is why we appeal to the EPP to postpone this vote until our next part-session and that if, in the meantime, the political nature of Mr Jarquín’s sentence is confirmed, we shall act properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the issues concerning the treatment of the President of the Nicaraguan Audit Office, Agustín Jarquín, by the Nicaraguan government have been around for over a year. It is, of course, a very serious matter which deserves in-depth discussion, but as far as we are concerned, we would prefer it if this was dealt with by the competent committee and not in this hasty manner. </p>
<p class="contents">It is a political issue. Indeed, one cannot help wondering whether there was a political motive behind the Audit Office’s accusation that the democratically elected government is corrupt? Quite possibly. After all, Agustín Jarquín, now under arrest, is a possible candidate for the presidency. </p>
<p class="contents">There is also another question. Does this corruption inferred by Jarquín actually exist within the Nicaraguan government? That too is possible because many say that Jarquín is unimpeachable. It is not up to us to make a party-political choice in Nicaragua. </p>

<p class="contents">We can clearly question the means which Mr Jarquín has used to an absolutely legal end, that is, investigating the rampant corruption in Nicaragua, a corruption which extends to the very highest authorities and which, for example, has multiplied the assets of the President of the Republic by a thousand. What is absolutely obvious to any impartial observer, however, is that, in this case, the intention has been precisely to prevent the investigation of corruption with the collaboration, furthermore, of the <span class="italic">Sandinistas</span>, and to get rid of the person who was going to be leader of the opposition in the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Union will intervene in this matter. That is what is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, this debate on human rights highlights yet again the need for us in the European Union to remain vigilant on this issue. All the individual cases discussed here this afternoon point to fundamental human rights violations. In the case of the death penalty in the USA and Yemen, the issue is the basic right to life. In the case of discrimination against women in Kuwait and Afghanistan, it is the right to civil equality. In the case of Djibouti, it is the right to freedom of opinion and freedom of political activity. In the case of Nicaragua – and here I differ with some speakers here today – it is clearly about the rule of law as such and the fact that people must be protected under the rule of law from arbitrary acts by the supreme state powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the time available, I should just like to make a few comments on these individual issues from the Commission’s point of view. As far as the death penalty is concerned, we all agree that it is incompatible with our European standards and must be vehemently condemned. The carrying out of a death sentence is an inhumane act which has no place in a civilised society.</p>
<p class="contents">So we know how we must react when death sentences are imposed or executed in individual countries. We must then examine what we can do in each individual case to prevent the death sentence from actually being imposed or executed. That applies to the cases referred to here. The European Union has set itself clear rules on how to proceed when not even minimum standards are respected. In such cases, the European Union must intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two of these minimum standards, namely when the death penalty is imposed against people who were not even 18 years old at the time of the offence, and when the death penalty is imposed on people who are mentally handicapped.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say briefly on the question of women in Kuwait that, like the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission is very disappointed at the result of the vote in Kuwait on 30 November. Nonetheless, we can say, and this point was raised here that, with a directly elected Parliament, Kuwait is still one of the most democratic countries in the Gulf. That does not alter the fact that this vote contradicts the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination and the international pact on civil and political rights. Both pacts have been signed by Kuwait. The Commission is very worried that Kuwait is not complying with this internationally ratified convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We must say that this development is particularly alarming in the light of the fact that it was the Emir of Kuwait, the head of state, who took the courageous decision, which the EU also welcomed, to grant women active and passive voting rights. This is an unusual case in which an authoritarian head of state is more progressive that the elected representatives of the people. The European Union will do its best to help achieve a breakthrough on this issue in Kuwait.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Afghanistan is concerned, the position has been clear for a long time. The European Union set out its point of view on Afghanistan in a common position on 25 January 1999 in which it said quite unequivocally and clearly that we demanded respect for human rights in Afghanistan and that, in particular, we defended the rights of Afghan women. This common position was shared by all the political groups in Afghanistan. The European Union has consistently repeated its rejection of the gender policy of the Taliban movement.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must say that the most regrettable aspect of the Taliban regime is the way in which women are treated. Not only is the entire female population denied access to education, but women are not allowed to take up independent work. In all the contacts which we have been able to make with the Taliban – and as you know, they have been quite limited – we have never left them in any doubt as to the fact that we condemn this behaviour and shall continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following the human rights situation in Djibouti very closely and with great concern. We have noted that the fundamental freedoms of those opposing the present regime in Djibouti are being violated time and time again. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the Djibouti authorities respect the fundamental rights of prisoners. We have expressed our point of view with regard to respect for the fundamental freedoms of man in contacts with the authorities in Djibouti time and again. Respect for human rights is one of the fundamental facets of our cooperation with Djibouti within the framework of the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Djibouti government must know that there will be consequences if, as a participant in the Lomé Convention, it fails to respect human rights. Cooperation between the European Union and Djibouti cannot remain divorced from this. We shall therefore support any initiatives designed to encourage the Djibouti government to take a stance in line with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns Nicaragua. The Commission has followed the events leading up to the arrest of the comptroller-general of Nicaragua, Mr Jarquín, with mounting concern and we endorsed the initiative taken by the Troika of the European Union on this issue on 18 November. I should like to say quite clearly with reference to the discussion held here, the political background to which I do, of course, fully understand, that even if the actions of the comptroller-general were politically motivated, that was no excuse to put him in prison. I think we are all in agreement on that. Our concern is that a political argument, irrespective of whether or not it was justified, and I do not want to go into that here, has been countered by the supreme power in the country by throwing the head comptroller of the country into prison. In the Commission’s view, the European Parliament should not remain silent on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the European Union has been a donor of non-repayable aid to Central America in general, and Nicaragua in particular, for many years. Following the new form of cooperation between the EU and central America decided at the San José Conference in Florence in 1996, and the strategy paper for cooperation between the EU and Nicaragua adopted in 1999, I must point out that the European Union in particular has been concentrating mainly in development cooperation with Nicaragua on strengthening the rule of law and supporting a fair social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If this cooperation is to be able to have full effect and the objectives are to be attained, we <span class="italic">must </span>agree to abide by democratic rules of play and common values and this necessarily includes respect for independent institutions, as provided for in the constitution. The Commission is confident that the Nicaraguan authorities will take account of the considerations voiced by the European Union and other members of the international community and that the measures taken against the Bureau of the Comptroller-General and the comptroller himself will be reversed.</p>
