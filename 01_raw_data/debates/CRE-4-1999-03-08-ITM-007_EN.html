<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hautala </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Mr President, I would like to say, concerning the previous speech, that Mrs Gradin has our full support to get the Daphne programme under way, and we will certainly be in a position to cooperate fully on this issue in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">But now I would like to focus on another matter. The European Commission commissioned a report from the University of Limerick on the subject of women"s health in the European Union. However, Parliament was rather perplexed as the Commission did not really make any decisions on the basis of the report, but sent it directly to us and the Council. Our task, as Parliament, then, is to lay down guidelines on how the issue of the state of women"s health should be understood.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly quite obvious that public health has improved in many respects and thus women are also healthier and live longer. However, we should realise there are new kinds of health threats which target women, such as the fact that more and more women have to be solely responsible for looking after their families, as single mothers. As is well known, they have many financial problems in such roles, and it is clear that the capacity and resources available for all the different kinds of health care are perhaps not perfect either.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also new kinds of health problems which women seem to suffer from in particular, and which were not really so very widespread in earlier times. Take, for example, eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, though it has to be said that, surprisingly, young men too have started to suffer from these. The nature of such problems is certainly so difficult to understand as to be inexplicable, but we should recognise these phenomena and think about where their actual origins lie. Why does society put so much pressure specifically on young women, pressure that makes them react in this way?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very interesting time to raise the matter of women"s health, as the European Union is committed under the Treaty of Amsterdam to including at least two matters connected with this as part of all its activities. The first issue to form part of all Union policy is equality between women and men, and the second is public health. In my report I state that we have before us a double challenge, and that we have to apply the principle of transparency. Thus we really must examine the Union"s future public health policy particularly, in this case, from the point of view of women.</p>
<p class="contents">My first contention is that women are very poorly represented in decision making in the healthcare sector. They are of course very fully represented in the workforce, for example as nurses. But they are clearly under‐represented on the managerial ladder and on decision‐making boards in the healthcare sector. I know of research that shows that when women are also included in the management team the whole perspective changes. More attention starts to be paid to preventing, rather than merely curing, illness. This is a very interesting example, and one that shows that women also have their own way of working when they are allowed to take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are illnesses that only affect women, especially in health problems relating to childbearing. It is vital that we ensure that at every stage of a woman"s life there are good, high‐quality basic healthcare services available to her, whether they relate to maternity problems, maternity welfare or other gynaecological issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are complaints that affect women in a different way from men: heart and vascular disease, and alcoholism. Depression also seems to be commoner among women. This all has to be discussed without forgetting that as the population ages, there will be even more of us older women in society and that will place enormous demands on the healthcare system.</p>

However, I would like to highlight the fact that we do not aim to attach more importance to women's health than to men's health but to look at them in an equal light. Nonetheless, we need to emphasise that some of the health problems experienced by women are different and therefore require specific action.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to describe again the state of women"s health in the European Union as we already have a very clear picture. Moreover, the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala – whom I would like to congratulate on her report – has already done this exhaustively and the details are included in all the documents. I am therefore only going to concentrate on those points that the Committee on the Environment wishes to stress. We essentially want to focus on primary prevention when harmonising measures on women"s health to be implemented in all the Member States. Some of these measures are already being implemented in certain countries and, in our view, we need to step up activities in specific areas. The first of these relates to smoking and alcohol consumption among women. It is particularly important to combat this among adolescents as more and more young women are beginning to smoke and consume alcohol at an earlier age, which is why preventive measures are important. It is also essential to highlight the importance of a balanced diet. Anorexia, bulimia and coronary diseases are becoming more prevalent and, in the case of anorexia and bulimia, increasingly common among young women. We must also work to prevent the spread of AIDS by providing young people with more information. Preventive measures like these should devote more attention to young people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, too, to look at secondary prevention measures as there are significant differences between the Member States. We need to introduce and implement more programmes to detect both cervical and breast cancer in the EU and provide systematic screening for all women, particularly those in high‐risk categories. Early detection of diabetes is becoming increasingly important as are the issues of hormone replacement therapy, osteoporosis and so on. In addition, we need to ensure that any health statistics published are broken down according to sex. There are substantial differences that must be taken into consideration when decisions are made if these statistics are not broken down, as is the case at the moment.</p>

<p class="contents">Mrs Hautala has made enormous efforts to improve the report and, in particular, to reach an agreement within the Committee on Women"s Rights that will allow us to finally approve it, and I congratulate her on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy also studied the report drawn up by the Commission, which shows statistically that there are clear differences between the disease processes in men and women and that particular solutions therefore need to be found to problems or diseases which are specific to women. It also highlights the fact that for women, universal public health cover is essential as they still have lower living standards and earn lower wages than men. In any event, the Committee on Research believes that we need better statistics on the public health situation which should be broken down according to gender, age group, income level and place of residence. We also believe that more scientific research is needed into the causes and appropriate treatment of diseases such as anorexia and bulimia which, unfortunately, are currently having devastating effects on the health of adolescents. It is also important to give greater consideration to occupational illnesses that are more common among working women, and this is particularly important today, 8 March. We must point out that since it is more difficult to organise women in society, we know less about the incidence of occupational illnesses among women.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marinucci </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, people are still reluctant to recognise that there is anything specific about women"s health, even though ample evidence exists. How could one fail to realise that women"s health is quite different from men's in certain respects? Men do not have problems linked to reproductive health, and have fewer ailments caused by nutrition and lifestyle. Men lead completely different lives from women and age less. If it is true – and it is – that ageing is currently one of the major problems confronting all our health systems, there are generally more elderly women among the population, and they are sometimes poorer than their male counterparts. Women"s health is different, as was recognised in the Beijing platform: indeed, its key paragraph recognised the right of women to the safeguarding of their health, above all their reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that the Commission has presented a report specifically on women"s health, but conclusions must be drawn from it, and I am grateful to our chairman, Mrs Hautala, for having rescued this report against all odds. She has made it down‐to‐earth, coherent and constructive, and is now rightly calling on the Commission to go one step further by presenting a specific programme. We wish women"s health to be taken into account in the health programmes and mainstreaming to be built into these, guaranteeing the high level of protection which is recognised – first in the Maastricht Treaty and then in the Amsterdam Treaty – as an obligation of the Union. We wish for even more than that: a specific programme! Surely the need for this is obvious, especially in respect of information?</p>
<p class="contents">Women do not take care of themselves; they are used to looking after the health of their families but neglect themselves and, often, neglect preventive care because they are too busy looking after their nearest and dearest. Once they realise they are ill, it is already too late. Campaigns must be mounted to educate and inform women, to convince them to look after themselves. Information campaigns must be directed at family doctors and general practitioners so that, when they enter a home to look after a sick child, they speak to the mother and ask her whether she is using contraceptives, whether she is looking after herself and whether contraception could help her avoid the need for an abortion. Family doctors and GPs should take every opportunity to make women think about themselves and answer questions on their health. Often they do not do so, which is why a specific programme is needed to provide information for women and for health personnel dealing with women. This topic must not be deferred any longer. Today is International Women"s Day, and not the Festival of Women, as its detractors call it. It is the day that Clara Zetkin called for in 1912 to advance the condition of women. We want women to occupy positions of power, but above all else we want them to be healthy, so that they can do so as well as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Heinisch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the past few years have seen enormous progress in our knowledge of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses that put women"s health at risk, there is still a great deal to be done in this area. I thank Mrs Hautala very warmly for her report.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have managed this time broadly to reconcile our positions on the important aspects with those of the other groups. The report concentrates on the essential aspect, namely women"s health, and also considers the distribution of powers in the European Union. The provisions on the controversial question of abortion and on toxic shock syndrome are worded in such a way that most Members can support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I still believe that it is difficult for the European Union to give an answer to the question of abortion. However, during the discussion on pregnancy, we gave priority to the possible health risk to the woman, including the psychological health risk, and even the risk to her life, in addition to the child"s right to life and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the report also takes up issues such as society‐related health issues, which also show that lifestyle, socio‐economic circumstances and a healthy life are determining health factors. I think it is only right that the report calls on the Commission to take into account and refer specifically to the topic of women"s health in its new action programme on health.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to improve the health of women, it is important to take targeted measures on information, prevention and health promotion. Women must become better informed and more involved in the planning and implementation of preventive programmes. Since women live longer than men and have a lower mortality rate at all ages and for all causes of death, there is a general impression that they are healthier than men. But the price of a higher life expectancy is the risk of becoming chronically ill and infirm. If we use indicators to assess the state of health that also look at illness and impairment, and not just mortality, we find that in all age groups the state of women"s health is worse than that of men. This applies particularly to older women. So we must aim to give women a greater chance of living their later years in good health, with greater independence and less impairment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kestelijn‐Sierens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the position of women in health care was one of the 12 strategic objectives at the conference in Beijing. The Amsterdam Treaty which will shortly be coming into force increases the Union"s powers in the areas of both health and equal opportunities. There is no longer any excuse to do nothing about a policy for women"s health. More to the point, we need a policy for women"s health. Certain diseases are specific to women, are more frequent in women or affect women differently from men, and in defining this policy the following points are of prime concern. A gender‐specific approach to health care can reduce its cost. Better prevention, for example through realistic health targets for conditions affecting women primarily in later life, such as osteoporosis, certain cancers and cardiovascular disease, can improve the quality of women"s lives. Equal and adequate access to health care remains a problem for some women outside the Union, but in the Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with its traditions, my group is sceptical about Europe interfering too much in policy areas which ought really to be regulated at national level. In other words, we do not want to undermine the subsidiarity principle. We certainly recognise the importance of a specific policy on health at European level, but we think this is only feasible if its aims are to prevent, encourage and coordinate. So we shall vote against paragraphs 10, 11 and 16, and part of paragraph 24. We would also warn of the excessive cost to the budget of all the calls for studies and research contained in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking personally, I should like to compliment the rapporteur on the way in which she revised the report after broad consultation with the groups. Mrs van Dijk"s report was not acceptable to us and we could not approve it. This report is much better, and at least makes clear what Parliament"s priorities are with regard to women"s health.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, today is known internationally as a day for taking action in support of women, and we need to reflect a little on the continuing, unimaginable struggles of the women"s movement, which continue to bring about many changes not only for women but for society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must honour the force of these struggles, and stress the need for them to continue, as crucial problems remain unsolved and other, new, problems appear which threaten their rights and achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Women continue to be one of the most vulnerable sections of the population, as their rights, including their right to health, are violated. These rights are often infringed by the current socio‐economic system, and we must acknowledge this if we want 8 March to be more than just an opportunity for anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the length and breadth of the planet cultural and political underdevelopment, hunger, wars and skirmishes, conservative and backward‐looking societies, economic regulations, have all dealt a cruel blow to women, to their role in the economy, in society and in the family.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hautala report puts forward interesting proposals regarding the serious health problems faced by women, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I wonder whether promoting issues relating to women"s health problems, and affording women protection under the law against discrimination of any kind, can be understood and strengthened within a socio‐economic system which commercialises everything and subjects public health to the harsh financial policy of EMU. I wonder whether a policy which affords women substantial protection can be implemented, regardless of the reorientation and the grass‐roots reorganisation of the development model of our society. In the face of exploitative and oppressive plans and practices, in the face of discrimination tactics, women are called upon to push forward and assert their claims together with men, in the context of a broad popular battle front ranged in each country. Today"s date, 8 March, and the tradition of militancy which accompanies it will show the way. Let us follow it unflinchingly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Seillier </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Madam President, in view of the short time I have to speak, I will be concentrating on the paragraph in my colleague"s report which is devoted to reproductive health. This term is a little complex, and I suppose we must take it to mean all health issues linked to a woman"s ability to give birth.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with your demand in paragraph 8 that ‘high quality reproductive health services" must be available to women, and with your demand in paragraph 12 that ‘attention is drawn to the advantages and disadvantages of hormonal treatments for menstrual and menopausal problems, and that alternatives to these are researched".</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like you to go into more detail about the advantages and disadvantages of hormonal contraception. However, I will not be able to agree to your recommendation in paragraph 10 where you call for ‘the promotion of unrestricted availability of contraceptives". Should we take this to mean that contraceptives are to be made available without any medical follow‐up, which is essential wherever hormonal contraceptives are being taken since they affect the endocrine system and natural hormonal regulation? I am therefore unable to agree with you on this point. I think unrestricted availability of contraceptives without any medical follow‐up does not show due respect for women"s health.</p>
<p class="contents">In anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing, I have obtained within the framework of STOA a study on the impact on health of the different contraceptive practices in Europe and the reliability in scientific terms of what is called natural family planning. Unfortunately, the study was ended prematurely. It would be worth resuming the work carried out on it because in accordance with the resolutions voted by Parliament on 11 March 1994 and 28 October 1994, I think we need to respect a genuine freedom of choice for women. They need to be aware of the risks involved in the different methods of contraception so that they can choose alternative methods without risk to their health.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the committee<span class="italic"> </span> for its constructive report on women's health. Mrs Hautala, the rapporteur, has produced an excellent piece of work. The Commission decided that its first specific report would be devoted to women's health and medical problems. The report deals with the major trends in women's health. It also includes an overview of women's illnesses and the factors that crucially affect women's health. Furthermore, the report discusses particular problems such as eating disorders, HIV/AIDS, family planning, abortion, the menopause and violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, to a certain extent women experience different health problems from men. We must therefore ensure that these differences are taken account of in health services and medical care. Adequate resources should also be made available. I also agree with Mrs Hautala that we need better data gathering on women's health. It is important that medical research takes into consideration the differences between women and men. We know, for example, that most experiments on animals are performed on males. As a result, women may experience undesirable and harmful effects when they use medicines that have only been tested on male animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives with the aim of promoting women's health. A study has been carried out on osteoporosis in older women, and the report will be ready shortly. The EU is also giving its support to projects that include studies of life expectancy and general health development, as well as of statistics relating to morbidity and mortality. In these studies, we have stressed the importance of gender differences. Support will also be given to studies on cancer, age‐related diseases and women's health problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996, the Commission has been running a special programme aimed at preventing AIDS and other infectious diseases. The programme includes several projects relating exclusively to women. Last year, for example, we set up a network to combat the spread of AIDS among women in the Mediterranean countries. The Commission recently submitted a report on the implementation of the 1995 directive relating to health and safety measures at work for pregnant women and women with new‐born infants or mothers who are breastfeeding, known as the pregnant workers directive. The conclusions of the Commission regarding implementation of the directive are generally satisfactory, although unfortunately some Member States have not yet implemented it in full. The Commission has therefore started proceedings against those countries for non‐compliance. This concerns, amongst other things, sick leave, a statutory two‐week paid holiday, maternity leave and a ban on allowing pregnant women to carry out work that is potentially harmful to health.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important instrument is the 1996 directive on parental leave. As you know, it entitles all employees, regardless of sex, to at least three months" unpaid leave to look after their own children of eight years or less.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the programme on equality of opportunity for women and men, the Commission has compiled a report on the representation of women in health services and medical care. The report covers state and semi‐private health care institutions in all the EU countries. A qualitative study of women in decision‐making positions has been carried out in France, Italy and Sweden. The results showed that involving women in health care decision making has a positive effect. Women bring new needs, ideas and values to the work. Furthermore, they often represent a different style of leadership and an alternative approach to decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission's ‘mainstreaming" strategy is to incorporate equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities. The Union's health policy is no exception, although consideration should be given to the differences that exist between the sexes. Parliament and the Committee on Women's Rights have, through this report, made a valuable contribution to the work in hand.</p>
