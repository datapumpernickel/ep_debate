<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cox </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, in its proposal to extend and deepen the base of energy taxation the Commission will have the support of Parliament. The energy tax directive is timely in terms of our commitments to reduce global warming and is desirable as a means of promoting greater energy efficiency and encouraging a lower energy intensity per unit of output; furthermore, it is necessary to explore new tax bases if we are ever to tackle successfully the structural difficulty in too many of our States of lowering non‐wage labour costs in societies suffering unacceptably high rates of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament will say ‘yes" to new taxes but ‘no" to more taxes. Regrettably Parliament cannot insist in law on fiscal neutrality, but it does so as a matter of political conviction. Member States and the Council will betray the wider public purpose of this proposal if they fail to use the extra revenue from energy tax to offset excessive non‐wage, tax‐driven labour costs. We insist on such a trade‐off because, to reiterate the point, this Parliament wants new tax but not more tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes an extension of the excise tax regime on hydrocarbons to a much more comprehensive tax base, including sectors that have heretofore been excluded in some or all of the Member States – sectors such as coal, gas, electricity and home‐heating oil. Parliament supports this as commendable, yet no sooner is this tax base definition established in the Commission proposal, than, through a complex series of total or partial exemptions, total or partial refunds, which variously are mandatory or optional, the Commission proposes a form of tax governance based more on exceptions than on rules. This, in our view, is a bad legislative proposal because it is too complex. It lacks the characteristics of good tax law, which should be simple to understand, easy to collect, predictable in its statutory implications and difficult to evade.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say that some colleagues confuse this proposal with the CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax. This is not a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax directive. The Commission services, and ultimately the College of Commissioners, have submitted to Parliament a proposal which, we believe, reflects too many of the priorities of the lobbyists with which they have dealt and too little concern for the wider public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In first studying the proposal, I recalled the rather unkind remark about a recent presidency in the United States, which likened the behaviour of the President to a cushion which, it was reported, always bore the marks of the last arse to sit on it. In some respects, the exceptionalism in this document appears to me to reflect that kind of logic. This is the kind of legislative proposal that has to stop. My report proposes radical surgery to remove the glut of exemptions but still proposes the retention of green exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">On tax deepening, we believe the Commission has opted for an unnecessarily complex formula. We propose starting with the Commission's Year 2000 tax rate proposals and then applying an accelerator formula, subject to five‐year review, but which would stay in place pending the outcome of the review. It has the advantage of clarity and certainty and avoids the endless institutional complications of the alternative proposed to us.</p>
<p class="contents">There remains the outstanding difficulty about firms and sectors whose costs may dramatically increase to the point where their competitive position could be destroyed. We do not ignore this issue: we propose a form of constrained subsidiarity, where such firms or sectors can seek relief provided there are extenuating circumstances, but where they must pass a wider EU test for objectivity so that they do not violate the rules of fair competition or the rules related to state aids.</p>
<p class="contents">I also propose an additional amendment at this stage that sectors where this is systematic should potentially be subject to a Commission‐approved block exemption or refund.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the European Parliament will support new energy and ecotaxes, but does not support more taxes. We demand fiscal neutrality of the states. We insist on lowering labour taxes as the counterpart of this tax. We want a simpler and more certain tax‐based definition than that proposed by the Commission. We want a more predictable base‐deepening formula for determining the evolution of tax rates. We want competitive handicap to be addressed where it is a genuine problem but not to be used as an excuse for going soft on necessary change. I commend the report to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind, however, that we are currently implementing the directive liberalising the electricity and gas markets whose main objective is to bring down energy prices. Progress is in fact being made. I am most familiar with the situation in my own country, Spain, where electricity prices have fallen by 11 %. Other countries have not moved as quickly. The directives are being implemented and liberalisation of the electricity markets is beginning to take place. I feel we would be trying to do too many things at once if we placed an additional tax burden on energy at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we do agree that in the future direct taxation should be replaced by indirect taxation and that energy should be taxed, provided there is genuine fiscal neutrality and that such a move does not result in increased costs for businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation means that we must become more competitive. As you are well aware, Commissioner, energy is very cheap in the United States. In Europe, taxes constitute the major part of the cost of energy and hydrocarbons are a good example of this. In France and Belgium, for instance, taxes on transport are very high, whereas in other countries such as Spain they are considerably lower.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, we need to legislate for all 15 countries and that is not an easy task. We must begin to liberalise the gas and electricity markets and we must become more competitive and implement countless regulations on the environment which businesses must then comply with. This week, for instance, we shall be considering the directive on water. Industry will be very much affected by this directive, and will have to make substantial investments. We shall also consider directives on waste. In our view, Commissioner, we must allow some breathing space before implementing this directive. We do agree with the spirit of the directive, but we do not think the timing is right.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be no more discussion on CO<span class="sub">2</span> . It is certainly true that if the cost of energy rises, it will be used more efficiently and less will be used. However, this calls for considerable investment. Emissions of CO<span class="sub">2</span> and other pollutants will certainly be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to support Mr Cox"s report. The directive you are proposing, Commissioner, is indeed complex and full of exceptions, but Mr Cox"s document, as approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, is far more radical and is also impossible to implement as it would do away with all grants and subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">We will vote against Amendments Nos 13, 14, 15, 16 and perhaps also against others. If they are approved by the House, we will vote against the report. What is currently consultation may in the future become codecision. Whatever the outcome, it would be advisable to postpone this directive for a while.</p>

I would also like to add that I failed, because I must have been distracted, to sign the register yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to endorse absolutely what the rapporteur has said. I want to speak on my own opinion on behalf of the Environment Committee in which the amendments were unanimously adopted by all members from all groups. The aim of those amendments is to indicate that while Mr Monti's proposals would be good, a green version of Mr Monti's proposals would be better. So our view is ‘brown Monti good, green Monti very, very good". However, I suspect that the Council will not have the wisdom either to take up Mr Monti's brown proposals or even any green version of Mr Monti that we choose to recommend to it. I believe that when you discuss harmonising taxation, you are talking not just about the technicalities of harmonising taxes but how you use them, and – it seems to me – the Council will miss a huge opportunity if it does not pick up the Monti proposals. It should remember what it has been saying about Kyoto and Buenos Aires and use this as an opportunity to influence the way in which energy is used in our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of my own stupidity, it may be that the Spencer report on CO<span class="sub">2</span> Energy Tax, for which I have been hereditary rapporteur for nearly ten years, will not reach Parliament in my time. It is being held in committee and I strongly recommend to Parliament that it remain held in committee. I believe that the Commission and the Council will have to come back to a CO<span class="sub">2</span> Energy Tax because that is one of the ways of making a real difference. I recommend that future Parliaments hold that report in committee and, if I might be a bit mischievous, perhaps leave the words Spencer on it, not for me but – since climate change is a long‐term issue – maybe for my daughters' time in this Parliament.</p>

In this respect, it should be emphasised that neither the original proposal for a directive, nor the proposal as amended by the European Parliament, can be anything other than a first step towards ecological tax reform, even though I have to agree with Mr Spencer that the proposal itself does not actually provide for a green energy tax. That is why my group also supports amending the Cox report, so that we at least make it obligatory for the Member States of the European Union not to levy taxes on electricity and other products derived from renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this proposal, which rightly seeks to tax energy so that the tax burden on labour can be eased – as already foreseen in the Delors White Paper of 1993 – improves the directive in this regard, also making it greener. I do not think that this has an adverse effect on the system; I believe it is necessary. I know that this directive is intended to make the internal market function more effectively, and to eliminate anything that interferes with it, including in the country of consumption, but we also need to bear in mind that in 1920, when the former economist, Mr Pigou, first developed the whole idea of using taxes to help to save resources, he also brought about a change in the nature of our debates by choosing this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the proposal for a directive to emphasise fiscal neutrality. In this respect, when it comes to implementation, efforts must be made in the Member States to ease the tax burden on labour so that the effects on employment really can come into play too. The energy tax – and this needs to be emphasised – is not an ecotax. I believe that there is actually an urgent need for us to reopen the unfortunate discussions and debates which we held at European level after Rio and Kyoto, and which yielded no results. Since then, I believe that many Member States have gone further than the proposal for a directive does.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it would be a good idea for European countries to learn from one another, and I would very much welcome any moves by companies which are heavy consumers of energy – and to whom a rebate will definitely have to be granted – to adopt a practice which has been so successful in Denmark, and to submit to an energy audit.</p>

Difficulties have also arisen in the drafting of Mr Cox"s report. On the one hand, the directive aims at fiscal harmonisation to improve the operation of the market. On the other, it seeks to meet an economic target: replacing labour taxes with energy taxes. In addition, it also has an ecological purpose. Combining three objectives in a single directive is bound to prove complicated. I feel that in his report, Mr Cox, the rapporteur, has attempted to lighten this heavy burden somewhat, and to reduce the scope of the triple objective a little. Preparing a Union‐wide harmonising directive on as complex a matter as energy is certainly a complicated business.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission"s initial approach was wise, because the problem calls for countless exceptions to the general rule. There is no other way of dealing with the situation. On this point, our group differs from Mr Cox"s approach. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to drafting fiscal regulations, exceptions are the rule, as existing regulations will prove. I therefore find it hard to understand why in this case the exceptions we feel are essential in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the European Union"s system of production cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as Mrs Estevan Bolea has already said, if the rapporteur"s position on the deletion of a series of amendments, that is, Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15, remains unchanged, we will vote against the report. We earnestly believe that to deal with this issue appropriately, and in view of the difficulties involved, the whole range of exceptions envisaged by the Commission, along with others which are bound to arise, ought to be included and analysed in depth.</p>

<p class="contents">The first of these involves strengthening the internal market. The proposed fiscal harmonisation aims to do away with current imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to ensure that the European internal market becomes more competitive at international level. Clearly, if better fiscal harmonisation becomes a reality, as the application of this tax sets out to achieve, it will be possible to do away with labour costs or lower them without reducing the level of fiscal income at Union and Member State level. As a result, the European Union as a whole will introduce an element of competitiveness into the cost structure on the international market.</p>
<p class="contents">The third challenge is also important, although I am aware that there have been some criticisms in this respect. An appropriate environmental policy will contribute to sustainable development, which is one of the European Union"s main aims. As we see it, Mr Cox"s report will allow these three challenges to be met, whilst allowing the Member States considerable leeway to adapt this directive, provided that there are no negative consequences for the level of competitiveness nor for the achievement of the European internal market, which is one of the Union"s main aims.</p>

<p class="contents">First, nobody can disagree with the need to protect the environment from energy product emissions. However, what we really need is positive intervention in favour of renewable forms of energy, in favour of the modernisation of plant and production methods in order to ensure that our energies are more environmentally friendly. We do not need indirect tax‐raising measures which will have a serious impact on people"s incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the level of taxation of energy products of all kinds which is being proposed here will, we feel, lead in some cases to a very significant rise in prices, which could be as much as 9 % or even 11 %. In a period of severe financial constraints within the framework of economic and monetary union, this will put increased pressure on the living standards and conditions of the public at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Madam President, we would like to express yet again our deep concern at the proposed substitution of social contributions made to the social security system, the so‐called ‘employment tax", by the so‐called ‘energy tax". Such substitution would not only not lead to an increase in social security funds, but would actually permit governments to privatise these funds, which would have severe repercussions on the entire social security system.</p>

I would also like to thank Tom Spencer for the work he has done for years now in this House in connection with the CO<span class="sub">2 </span> tax proposal. The Green Group fully agrees with Mr Spencer that we must preserve this proposal for a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax. We must not reject it, as it contains more elements which would influence environmental behaviour than Mr Monti"s proposal which we are now discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox really has made this proposal of Mr Monti"s ‘greener". It now contains clear justifications for exemptions, and these exemptions have indeed to be justified from the environmental point of view. Furthermore, his explanation of how industry could receive energy tax relief is extremely clear. He suggests that industry must be able to justify this relief for reasons of competitiveness, and everything should then proceed under the eye of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox"s report proposes taking as a starting point the tax base in the year 2000, which would then be increased by 2 % above inflation every year for a period of five years. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very modest increase. If we wish to move in the direction of environmental sustainability, we would do well to consider a slightly bolder approach. For this reason the Green Group have made a proposal for this annual index figure to read 4 % above inflation. The difference between Mr Cox"s proposal and ours is that over five years his proposal would increase energy taxation by some 10 %, while ours would not increase it any more than 20 %. I therefore appeal to you all to consider this amendment by the Green Group.</p>

We want the right to impose higher taxes on energy so that we can make savings and promote the switch to renewable energy. The June Movement also insists on representing those who have no voting rights, those who will come after us. We cannot simply squander the Earth's scarce resources. If the border between Denmark and Germany is abolished, people will go to Germany and buy cheap petrol and heating oil. The taxes will end up in the German Treasury instead of the Danish Treasury. We shall then be forced to lower our taxes and duties to the German level. There will then be less money in the public purse to finance support for education, early retirement and old age pensions. We have greater equality between people in Denmark than in Germany and the rest of the EU. The June Movement defends this Nordic welfare model, and that is why we vote for the highest possible minimum prices but, at the same time, we want to remain free to tax energy which is imported at lower prices, so that French nuclear power does not replace action to switch to renewable energy, solar energy and wind power. There are only guaranteed minimum prices for wind energy in three countries: Germany, Spain and Denmark. And it is here that we have most of the world's windmills. Solar energy and wind power must not be exchanged for nuclear power.</p>

This is an accomplished balancing act between the two main thrusts of our policy, which come into conflict with each other in the most fundamental of projects. At a time when combating the massive levels of unemployment is the main economic and social concern of European policy, and when we are all aware of the dangers of damaging the environment by using non‐renewable forms of energy, the cautious but clear‐cut approach outlined here seems to be the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that some of the amendments which make the report more obviously a green one, giving greater emphasis to the decisive role which renewable sources of energy will play here in the future and promoting their use, will be accepted. On the other hand, amendments such as Amendment No 13, which would bring huge losses for some branches of industry and cause jobs to be lost, should be rejected.</p>

It makes the Commission proposal clearer and ensures that it will be effective. Nonetheless, I should like to take up two points which are mentioned in the Environment Committee"s report. At this stage, I should also like to thank Mr Spencer, in particular, for his determined efforts on this matter and for his trusting cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns the issue of renewable sources of energy. I believe that if we also want this tax reform to result in a change of direction, then we need to exempt renewables from this tax, because we should not make them subject to national competition. If one country says it will exempt them and another says it will not, then this issue will immediately be at the mercy of competition. That is why we should send out a clear signal based on Mr Cox"s proposal – clear, efficient rules. I say: let us exempt renewables from this tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to the sector currently responsible for the greatest increases in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, namely aviation. Last year, there was a 17 % increase in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. This sector is completely excluded because there are certain problems with levying this tax on kerosene. I would urge you, therefore, to accept Amendment No 29 and to say that we are bearing this in mind and that we instruct the Commission to propose an adequate solution so that this sector too can be included.</p>

It aims to improve the environment, reduce labour costs and promote the optimum operation of the single market, while all the time of course avoiding any risk of jeopardising the competitive position of our industries. The proposal is no doubt based on good intentions, but both the proposal itself and its amended version lead me to question what its effects are likely to be in practice for labour‐intensive companies, including many SMEs. If, out of a perfectly justifiable concern for the competitive position of energy‐intensive companies, they are granted an exemption, refund or reduction in energy tax, on an individual basis or otherwise, I wonder whether this does not present a real risk that it will be mainly the labour‐intensive companies which will find themselves paying the CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax. If we assume that tax neutrality is not applied per operating unit but rather in a horizontal and more general manner, is there then not a real danger of shifting fiscal pressure from energy‐intensive companies to labour‐intensive companies? Would we not then, I wonder, be achieving the very opposite of what we set out to do, with small polluters paying relatively more than the large ones, and labour‐intensive companies being harder hit than energy‐intensive companies?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the SMEs are not very happy about this. There is not much support for this proposal in such circles, and I should like to have heard you say something to refute what I have just suggested. I should also like to know how you view the timing. When do you think the Council will take a decision on this?</p>

It steers producer and consumer behaviour in a way that has a positive impact on the environment. The prime objective cannot be a fiscal one.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are certain issues that cannot be avoided. One is the northern view of this matter. The record for cold weather in Finland was exceeded this winter: minus fifty‐four degrees. At the moment it is minus thirty in Helsinki, and more than forty degrees below zero in the north. Furthermore, I should like to point out that distances are very great in the north, and energy is required for purposes of mobility. My constituency measures a distance of 1 300 kilometres across. When I consider the two issues of the need for heating and the need for mobility, we must be eligible for exemptions and these exemptions must be made available for households too, as otherwise ordinary people living in remote areas will be paying for the very tax relief which this policy wants to grant to energy‐intensive industry. It is being proposed that employers" contributions be reduced, but in our case those reductions would result from wrong intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the European Union is so naturally diverse, it must be able to apply differing taxation systems. We accept a minimum standard, but EU regulation must end there.</p>

However, as a Green, I can say that I regard this as an important, if tentative step, in fact only a first small step forward on taxation – or at least harmonisation – in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, however, I shall also make two points: I think Mr Cox was right to say that renewables should be exempted, because of course this is also about triggering a turning‐point in our energy policy. We all know that the future belongs to renewables, and that here too we need to set the right course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also hoping, however, that the House will support our amendment seeking to exempt local public transport, because this too is a decisive point. If we want to contribute towards reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, then we need to cut the damaging numbers of private cars on the roads, which is of course one of the aims of this tax on consumption. But it is also necessary to create incentives for environmentally friendly local public transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we should not continue to subsidise air traffic. There are other possibilities, such as a tax on CO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions, which might exonerate us from the principle of unanimity, and which would also be compatible with international agreements. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Commission will finally present an adequate proposal to us in March.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up: we think that this is an important step in the right direction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, over the last two decades labour in Europe has been taxed increasingly heavily. If this trend is reversed, which – the exception proving the rule – is what has happened in my country since 1994, the persistently high level of unemployment in the European Union can be substantially reduced. It is in this context that we must view the two taxation reports – the Cox and Pérez Royo reports – submitted to us today. The tax burden must be shifted from labour to the environment and capital income. The Cox report deals with excise tax on energy products. The main problem with the present legislation is that the tax base is very incomplete. A number of energy products, such as natural gas, coal and electricity have to date been exempt from excise duty. Other fuels which are normally taxed are granted exemption in the case of specific uses, such as kerosene for aviation or fuel for shipping or fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">A third problem is that the same fuels are taxed differently depending on their use. Fuels used for transport purposes are taxed more heavily than if used for heating. Fuels which are generally used by industry are also subject to a lower tax than fuels for consumer use. A final problem is that although the minimum taxation rates are harmonised at European level, this is at such a low level that it virtually ceases to have any meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Cox report cannot be expected to deal with all these problems at once. This is legislation requiring a unanimous vote in the Council, which is usually a guarantee of inaction. But what the report does recommend – and we strongly support this – is extending the tax base to include coal, natural gas and electricity, scrapping some of the mandatory use exemptions and increasing and index‐linking minimum rates. This indexing also includes the notion of an accelerator. Every year the tax must not only keep pace with inflation but increase by 2 % above the inflation rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Cox report retains optional exemptions which the Member States are at liberty to grant, while nevertheless tightening up the conditions. All in all, this report is a major step in the right direction, not only in terms of shifting the tax burden but also in environmental terms, as many uses which were previously tax exempt will now be taxed for the first time. It is also clear that much more remains to be done in both these respects. The lower rates for energy products used by industry, for example, are totally indefensible from an environmental point of view as it is precisely these fuels which cause the most pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the optional exemptions which the Member States can still apply are totally irrational in environmental terms. Nevertheless, this report is still very much needed, and it sends a strong signal to the Council about where Parliament stands on this issue – a necessary signal, as the Council does not seem to be strengthening the Commission proposals but rather undermining them to the point where they scarcely have any meaning at all. This is why I appeal to fellow party members in the European governments to put the need to shift the burden of taxation away from labour before national short‐term interests. I believe this matter should be a test case in this respect.</p>

We must make sure that the objectives claimed for it are attainable and that fairness and cohesion are not overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as with the initiative on the taxation of carbon dioxide emissions, once again it is being claimed that the targets are fiscal neutrality and the replacement of taxes on labour, thereby helping to create jobs. Apart from the obvious fact that any measure that changes production processes cannot be called neutral, another question is whether taxation penalising energy use will not discourage investment – by SMEs in particular – and thereby result in job losses. We also need to ask to what extent direct taxation will be replaced by a form of taxation that, if it succeeds, will discourage the use of energy and therefore will not bring in more revenue. In other words, there is a conflict between the parafiscal and fiscal aims – you cannot have your cake and eat it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important question is how to avoid regressive taxation, given that poorer people spend proportionately more of their money on energy, and how we can prevent poorer countries from being penalised, as they lie on the outer edges of the continent, have less up‐to‐date equipment and face higher transport costs. This problem exists in the north, as Mr Seppänen said, but it is more serious in the south. It is especially unacceptable to penalise road transport when there is no proper alternative in the form of rail – something that should be given European Union support as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a look at the figures: in fuel tax, road tax and tolls, road users already pay twice as much as is spent on them, compared with just 56 % in the case of rail and 18 % for shipping. These taxes are equal to 2 % of the European Union"s GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on you to support the amendment tabled by Mrs Esteban Bolea, from my group, to avoid discrimination between different forms of transport – not forgetting air transport, which is also responsible for pollution.</p>

Now the rapporteur, Mr Cox, and the opinion from the other committee, as well as some of the amendments, have in fact turned this report into a ‘green' proposal, setting us on the road to compliance with the agreements reached in Kyoto and Buenos Aires, as well as in the other conventions relating to the reduction of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. The introduction of tax credits for solar, wind and water power might also send a clear signal to industry when it is investing in energy, thereby facilitating the transition to renewable energy sources. I therefore regard this report as a first step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the recommendation that the Member States should achieve fiscal neutrality by lowering labour taxes and taxing energy instead – a so‐called tax trade‐off – immeasurably improves the proposal by pointing it in a totally ‘green' direction. I would also urge you to support the amendment tabled by the Green Group.</p>

This will, however, be a difficult task in view of the existing differences amongst the 15 Member States and because we ought not to increase prices. That might mean losing competitiveness and employment, which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming at.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands at the moment, this proposal involves increasing taxes and making the cost of transport dearer in the ‘cohesion countries", that is, those countries that are located on the periphery of Europe and that, in fact, produce the least pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if the tax is extended to cover other energy products, the internal market will not be harmonised. Instead, competition amongst the various sources of energy will be distorted. For instance, coal – which is still our main indigenous source of energy and currently undergoing a technological revolution – will be heavily penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox"s proposals present a somewhat contradictory situation. If the European energy‐consuming industries that are currently making great efforts to save energy are exempted, our competitive edge will be lost. That technological effort would be penalised and competitiveness on the international field jeopardised. The steel sector is a good example of many of these industries. It competes both within the European Union and internationally, with energy as an important factor.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this situation, we find it difficult to accept a number of unilateral proposals that were put forward. The Spanish Socialists will vote against Mr Cox"s proposals and we hope agreement will be reached in Council. Nevertheless, I must stress the difficulty of the task because not only do the different arrangements for energy in the various countries need to be harmonised but also the very countries that are least responsible for the high level of pollution in Europe will be penalised.</p>

Mr Cox"s approach, basically to simplify the proposal, is of course commendable, but it does not meet with the approval of a majority of the Group of the European People"s Party, as indeed has already been emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have also already made it clear in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy that we agree with Articles 13 and 15 in terms of the approach chosen by the Commission and presented to us here, and are not in favour of their deletion. The Commission"s approach, to have the EU define the main exemptions and not the Member States, is the one that we favour, because we believe that if the Member States lay down the exceptions, then competition will become a major factor after all, because in fact no indication is given of the scale of the exceptions permitted. There will be a flood of control measures here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard – and indeed we know – that the focus is on the environment, but also on jobs. However, it is precisely the competitiveness of energy‐intensive end products, such as steel, cement, aluminium and others, which is at stake here, and it is also from the point of view of competition from third countries that uniform rules should be adopted in the EU, as advocated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">An increase in energy prices, as proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and in particular in Mr Cox"s amendments, is something we oppose, because this of all things seems to us to be counter‐productive from the point of view of employment.</p>

I should also like to thank Mr Spencer, who has, after all, kept the home fires burning for many years. Unfortunately, the fire will probably have to burn for even longer, because I suspect that the Council of Ministers will not reach an agreement. That is also illustrated even now by the very inconsistent picture here in the House. That is the real problem. In this respect, I think that the Commission proposal is sensible, because it does not in fact take the environment as a starting‐point, but Article 99, and therefore the harmonisation of existing taxes. I think that is much more sensible; it brings us closer to our goal perhaps, simply because liberalising the markets means that we are compelled to harmonise the background conditions too. The fact that this also has an environmental side‐effect is all to the good. Whether the Council appreciates that, I do not know; I suspect that there will be substantial difficulties there, but in any case I wish the German Presidency the best of luck with making further progress on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one more comment: paradoxically, it is actually industry which has had the greatest success in cutting its energy use in recent years, while private consumption and consumption in the transport sector have tended to increase. This is plain to see in the countries of Central Europe. In proportion to gross domestic product, energy consumption has fallen, in some cases dramatically, while the energy consumption of households and the transport sector has risen. If, therefore, we wish to have a device, an environmental device, for reducing energy consumption, we must, I am afraid, mainly target households and the transport sector and design a tax instrument in such a way that it particularly affects them. That is probably also why this tax is so unpopular. No party will win an election if it puts this at the centre of its campaign. Nevertheless, I see this as a long‐term task which we have to set ourselves, and I should like to thank all those who are working on introducing these thoroughly unpopular, but reasonable measures.</p>

<p class="contents">In its proposal for a directive to introduce a new framework for energy taxation, the Commission has made a proposal for road transport which the rapporteur, Mr Cox, obviously regards simply as one of the many confused exemptions which he wishes to remove from the draft directive. In Article 16 of its draft text, the Commission proposes that it should be possible for Member States to introduce tax reductions for road transport, if at the same time charges are imposed on a non‐discriminatory basis which reflect infrastructure, environmental and congestion costs.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, in the committees, my colleagues in the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against the deletion of Article 16, and I should like to strongly urge all of you to do the same at the vote in plenary, because the provisions which the rapporteur wishes to delete from the draft directive form the starting‐point for a new approach to European transport policy, for a transport policy which is environmentally friendly and efficient. The Commission was only being consistent when it integrated the concept of charging into the proposal on energy taxation, because this is in line with the proposals it made in its Green Paper and subsequently also in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I agree with the principles contained in these documents, and that is why I should like to advise Parliament also to be consistent and to support this new departure for transport policy in the debate on energy taxation, particularly since we have already done so in the House in the context of our debate on the Green Paper. I would therefore urge you to make an efficient and sustainable transport policy a possibility in Europe and to vote in favour of Article 16 as it stands in the Commission proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schmidbauer has hit the nail on the head: the fair payment model in the transport sector has shown us that we need to work on the essential points, which means that we should dispense with cross‐subsidisation. Non‐wage labour costs are a completely self‐contained issue which needs attention. We need more competition there and we must see to it that we bring about significant reductions in these costs, and that personal responsibility plays a greater part in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy taxation is a completely separate sector. As far as energy taxation is concerned, it is basically a question of bringing costs down to reasonable levels, so that we become more competitive internationally and create new jobs. Excessive price increases will simply result in job losses in the energy‐intensive sectors, such as steel, and all the others with which we are so familiar. I must also stress that we cannot disregard the consumer. At the end of the day, it is consumers who create jobs, by deciding which products to buy and which services to use. We cannot force them into these decisions by adopting general regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also why I think having a ceiling for energy‐intensive companies is very important. It ought to ensure that those businesses which have already brought their technical facilities up to date – and have thus gone a long way towards bringing their energy consumption close to its theoretical minimum level – are given due recognition. We should reward those which are minimising their energy input. In this case, higher rates of energy tax will not bring any further significant reductions. In addition, and quite apart from the environmental argument, doubt has also been cast on the effect which this would have on easing the employment situation. Only competitive companies are in a position to meet these requirements. I am therefore in favour of a system which is not out of proportion, but which will actually be able to achieve the declared objectives.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to Mr Cox for his clear and consistent report and for the conclusions he has reached in it. I am really glad that you are in full agreement with the grounds for this proposal and the way in which they have been put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has put a proposal to the Council, based on the need to modernise the Community system of taxing mineral oils, and extending this to cover all energy products. This has to be done to improve the functioning of the internal market. The measures proposed are actually designed to reduce the distortions caused by taxation that currently exist in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also taken advantage of the opportunity which this proposal affords of both meeting its responsibility for reviewing the minimum rates of duty on mineral oils and responding to ECOFIN's request that it table new proposals now that, as you will be aware, the negotiations on the CO<span class="sub">2</span> /energy tax have reached an impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also to say to the House that we are seeing ever increasing concern – and that has been patently clear this morning – about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels; and the Council's recent adoption, in response to the Kyoto Protocol, of the limits on polluting emissions to be achieved by the Union is a further example of this. Those objectives will not be easy to attain, but the fiscal measures – and Mr Spencer and a number of other honourable Members pointed this out – are one of the specific ways that can be used to achieve them. I am also grateful for the acknowledgement that has come from many sectors that this is a step in the right direction in environmental terms as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 and 5 and some parts of Amendments Nos 12 and 14, particularly those parts of Amendment No 14 that refer to renewable energies. However, we cannot agree to the proposal that we should move directly to the second stage, provided for in relation to the minimum rates, as early as January 2000, and then move on to annual increases equivalent to the rate of inflation plus 2 % for the five following years. Moreover, as regards removing the initial stage of increases in the minimum rates for which the date was initially set at 1 January 1998, it is worth pointing out that this deadline has long since passed. However, the discussions in the Council have shown that even the minimum rates caused problems for a number of Member States. Consequently, any increase in those rates is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the proposal that the minimum rates could be increased annually on the basis of the rate of inflation, increased by 2 % for a period of five years. The Commission proposal limits the tax increases to the rate of inflation in an effort to meet half‐way those Member States that would be compelled to introduce substantial tax increases simply in order to reach the minimum rate laid down. It is therefore unacceptable to compel the Member States to apply increases that are actually above the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we cannot agree to the removal of the bulk of the – compulsory or optional – exemptions and reductions that have been proposed for products that are not currently subject to taxation. Those exemptions and reductions were provided for very specific reasons: some are already reflected in the Community legislation currently in force, and others are needed to meet certain Community commitments arising out of international agreements. There is a final group considered vital to secure the competitiveness of the Community industries in relation to their third country competitors. Furthermore, I do not need to remind the House that this is an issue that requires unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thyssen and other honourable Members have asked for information concerning the progress of this issue in the Council and the timetable for it. I can tell you that the relevant Council working group has been asked to submit to the ECOFIN Council meeting of 15 March a report that will then be referred to the Cologne European Council in June. And so we shall soon be able to see whether or not a political consensus is forming. I very much hope it is.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point I should like to make in conclusion, Mr President. What we are dealing with here is fiscal coordination which meets the needs of the internal market and, in this instance, environmental needs, and which is also, as many of you have pointed out, a response to the need to shift the tax burden in such a way as to promote employment. There have been times in the course of recent European debates when a peculiar attitude has emerged: there has been a tendency to look back and to reflect on the earlier White Paper, as if no progress had been made since then towards achieving the kind of coordination we are talking about. In point of fact, the progress that has been made is now clear: this morning, we have the Cox report on energy, and the House will shortly be debating the Pérez Royo report on taxation of savings income. Meantime, the code of conduct to prevent harmful tax competition is being applied, and next week I shall be presenting to the Commission the proposal to allow those Member States that so wish to apply a reduced rate of VAT to labour‐intensive services. And so, as you can see, the various elements of genuine progress towards fiscal coordination designed to encourage employment are under way; they all have the firm backing of this House, for which I am very grateful.</p>
