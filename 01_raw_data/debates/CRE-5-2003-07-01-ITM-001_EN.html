We are also grateful for the assistance which they have offered in a number of areas of interest to Parliament, including the conclusion of our negotiations on an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation and law-making, the party political statute, and their considerable assistance - although we are still short of target - in working with us on the issue of the Members' Statute.</p>

<p class="contents">Last January, when we held the first debate here on our priorities, I stressed that what we had to strive for was to support a strong Europe, which participates and acts in a multi-centre global system and works for peace, development and cooperation. Six months of important events and developments have intervened. I believe that, because of these events, Europe has grown up over these six months. Events have allowed it to see its weaknesses, such as the crisis in Iraq, but they have also allowed it to see its strong points. Despite the crisis, there has been a feeling of unity, a feeling of cohesion, a feeling of a common mission. Events have made it politically more mature and more determined to proceed with new actions and have highlighted the need to meet the challenges relating to its future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is highly illustrative that the Convention completed its work on the draft constitution and that this draft constitution was accepted by the Convention by a large majority. It is likewise highly illustrative that the Council of Ministers started a debate on European defence and security, a debate which continued at the summit in Thessaloniki. The problems resulted in an awareness of what has to be done and done quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece had the good fortune to assume the Presidency in an exceptionally important six-month period. A six-month period, as I said, of unexpected events. Events which presented huge difficulties, but which were also a huge challenge, to which I believe we all responded, by which I also mean both the Member States and the Commission as well as the Presidency. Today, the debate on foreign policy, defence, security, the global strategic perception of Europe which has come about over these months and the draft Constitutional Treaty, bears witness to the fact that work has now begun, work which will result in a different form of cooperation. And it will, I trust, be positive for Europe and it will be work which will give us new momentum. We have realised that we must take decisions as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in December 2002, the Greek Presidency presented its priorities and specific objectives. We said then that we had five main priorities. First of all, to complete the enlargement of the European Union. Secondly, to speed up the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Thirdly, to complete the work of the Convention on the future of Europe. Fourthly, to deal with the phenomenon of illegal immigration and immigration in general and, fifthly, to promote specific priorities in the field of foreign relations. I can state today, at the end of these six months, that we worked hard towards these objectives and that we achieved very satisfactory results, which I should like to set out for you briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The ceremony for the signing of the Accession Treaty by the 10 candidate countries, which set the seal on enlargement, was a ceremony which marked one of the most important events in the development of Europe. It confirmed the regeneration of Europe; we celebrated it on the foothills of the Acropolis, our wish being to provide a particular symbolism for the continuation of European civilisation. Immediately before that, the Greek Presidency dealt with a series of difficulties that had arisen, such as new requests from the new Member States for existing agreements to be adapted and for new funding and such as the debate we had with you, here in the European Parliament, on issues of enlargement and funding or funding of the enlarged Union. Now the new Member States have integrated smoothly into the work of the Council of Ministers, at which they will participate as active observers pending the ratification of the Treaties by the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the integration of Cyprus, which joined together with the other nine countries and constitutes the justification of the fight for political restoration, for the restoration of the principles of international law. We were very close to having a united Cyprus in the Union, to overcoming the political problem, but unfortunately, the Turkish-Cypriot leadership did not want to complete the procedure started on the basis of the Annan plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In April, the Council adopted revised partnership texts with the three candidate countries. As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, the objective is to complete their accession negotiations by the end of 2004. We advanced numerous chapters in the negotiations with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The new partnership with Turkey includes specific terms on numerous issues, including the good neighbours policy, property belonging to minorities, religious freedom and limiting the role of the army.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second issue, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of Lisbon, we know how important the issues described under this title are and that, provided we resolve them, they will help us deal with the problems of development, environmental charges and the creation of a knowledge-based economy. The most important results, briefly, are as follows: the agreement on better coordination of financial policies and the adoption of the new economic policy guidelines for the period from 2003 to 2005. We shall now have economic policy guidelines for three years and this is, I believe, important so that we can plan better.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point was the new employment strategy. We introduced the tripartite social conference which was informal and has now been formalised and which, of course, allows us to broaden the social dialogue. There was agreement on tax arrangements in relation to tax evasion to third countries and taxation of energy products. The agreement on tax arrangements in relation to tax evasion had been discussed for a very long time in the Council without our coming to any conclusion and I am glad that we managed to overcome the problems under the Greek Presidency, problems which also arose because certain countries felt, and still feel, that they should try to make special arrangements of their own on such basic issues. We overcame that.</p>
<p class="contents">Another arrangement which had been discussed for a very long time was the European patent. We completed the relevant debate and there was agreement, as there was on the action plan to increase investment in research and incorporate new technologies into European education systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the adoption of the Small Business Charter, the decisions to improve the regulatory framework and the agreements on integrating the European stock exchanges were important.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions on the liberalisation of the energy market, on the carriage of freight by rail and on the new trans-European energy network and on extending the transport network were the subject of long discussion, but we completed them.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the new strategy for sustainable development, the introduction of environmental objectives in sectors such as renewable sources of energy, decisions to withdraw single hull tankers and the agreement on environmental liability close this brief report. I should like here to emphasise that the decision to withdraw single hull tankers, on which all the interested parties cooperated, was an important decision for environmental protection, a decision which in previous efforts years ago, after the accident of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>was not taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that brings me to the third subject, the Convention on the Future of Europe. At the European Council in Thessaloniki, as you know, the Convention's final proposal was presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing. Discussions were held for 18 months in the Convention and your participation was a determining factor. The draft Constitutional Treaty emerged with a high degree of support. We discussed in Thessaloniki whether this draft is a draft for starting negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference and whether it is a good basis for discussion. And we agreed that it is a good basis, which will help to get the negotiations started, because we realised that the terminology should not create confusion with respect to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement in the Convention shows that the frameworks within which we can change things are frameworks which need to be based on broad acceptance. The Convention expressed broad acceptance and that is a basis for us to resolve the problem. We must not start discussing everything from square one at the Intergovernmental Conference, nor must we focus on one issue or another and fail to reach a solution which has politically predefined margins, as referred to in the decision taken in Halkidiki.</p>
<p class="contents">We must close the Intergovernmental Conference by 1 May and we must sign after 1 May, so that the new members can sign and the text is ready before the elections on 15 June, so that the European citizens know what they will be voting on. This is the timetable – if the matter can be closed earlier so much the better – but the final cut-off date for the presentation of the signed text must be 15 June. We also agreed that the Convention will continue for a certain period of time to examine the text in order to process the third chapter, which concerns policies, as the text states, on technical matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In Thessaloniki, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed immigration policy. What was the problem? The problem is that in Seville and Tampere we had a great many decisions and that we could not complete and apply these decisions, the first and main reason being the lack of funds. The European Commission stated that it had approximately EUR 140 million at its disposal. We noted that this sum was available and we then decided to promote coordination and cooperation on guarding the borders, because it is clear that the problem of illegal immigration, as we saw a few weeks ago in Italy, for example, cannot be dealt with by one country alone, given that illegal immigrants come in, for example, by boat and try to disembark in one Mediterranean country or another and there must be overall monitoring of the area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point we emphasised was the undertaking to repatriate illegal immigrants. We called on the Commission to examine the possibility of new ways of safeguarding repatriation. However, because there are already numerous treaties and agreements on repatriation, which essentially do not operate, we said that the Commission would need to evaluate cooperation with third countries on all issues relating both to immigration and cooperation with the European Union on the basis of specific criteria and take this into account when making agreements or policies with these countries, because it is not possible – this is not stated in the text but it is generally accepted – for us to make a policy of active help and cooperation while, at the same time, the countries we trade with are indifferent to the obligations which they have to combat the phenomena of illegal immigration. We decided to proceed to create a common information technology system for issuing visas to third country nationals, which will allow illegal immigrants to be controlled, and we took certain decisions on the integration of immigrants into our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, following the Thessaloniki Summit, an agreement was reached on the reform of the common agricultural policy. Here again, the Presidency played an important part and we believe that this agreement is particularly useful because it sends out three central messages.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the agreement mean to farmers? It means that they will have a multiannual, guaranteed, predictable framework of income support similar to that which they enjoy today, as well as large margins as regards their production and business options. For European citizens, the agreement means a better quality of life, because farmers' income support will depend on compliance with European legislation on the environment, public health, food safety, hygiene and animal welfare. Thirdly, shifting a very large part of common agricultural policy subsidies from products to income support to farmers will seriously strengthen the position of the European Union at the forthcoming WTO negotiations. With this agreement, the Union will speak with one clear voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as far as foreign relations are concerned, I can report that there was agreement between the Member States of the Union, followed by agreement with the countries of the Western Balkans, confirming the accession prospects of the countries in the region, adopting a new procedure for regular political dialogue and promoting the harmonisation of their legislation with the Community <span class="italic">acquis </span>and an important increase in financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq, as we know, was the most difficult chapter of our Presidency. Many people expected it to take up all our time. It did not, of course, and what the Presidency aspired to was to overcome the differences, not by discussing if certain people were or were not right to support one position or another, but to overcome the differences by pointing out what would need to be done in the future. And following the United Nations Security Council resolution, there is now a framework for cooperation and we are in constant contact with the United Nations so that we can help with the reconstruction of Iraq within the framework of its resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Middle East is concerned, you know that the timetable for peace in the region, the so-called road map of the Quartet, was published and that the European Union is participating in this Quartet. The Presidency had repeated contacts with the countries in the area and with the other countries and I believe that the truce achieved is the result both of the actions of the Quartet and of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trans-Atlantic relations are concerned, the Greek Presidency made every possible effort to defuse the tension which had arisen in trans-Atlantic relations and I believe that the visit to Washington demonstrated that we have good cooperation. A principle was accepted which I believe to be self-evident; in other words, that we must cooperate for the necessary reasons, for economic, political and security reasons, with the United States. We can agree, we can disagree, when we disagree we can agree to disagree and continue our cooperation on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency promoted a substantial improvement in relations between the European Union and Russia at the summit held in St Petersburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to move from political issues to defence and security policy. Our aim was for the European Union to have full operational capability. And it acquired it during this period. It acquired it by settling outstanding issues, such as the contribution of forces on the part of the partners, the application of the programme of manoeuvres and the development of crisis management procedures. As a result, a European Union force is now in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, there is a policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and we are also discussing the military mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina to take over the current activities of the ΝΑΤΟ force there.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council in Thessaloniki, the report on the strategy to gradually formulate a European defence and security doctrine was presented and discussed. The informal Council of Foreign Ministers had asked for this report from Mr Solana. Mr Solana will continue work in connection with this report and we believe that the report and the relevant debate will be an important step towards clarifying our common objectives in relation to defence and security and the means with which we shall achieve the common objectives. The report helped to overcome the opposition which had appeared – and which I do not believe really existed – between certain countries cooperating to promote defence and security issues and other countries which did not want any such particular cooperation. We are now sitting at the same table and the discussion will show how we can address these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to refer to two issues relating to Community institutions. The first is the review of the status of Community staff. This is the first radical reform of the salary and pension system and the career system since the European Community was founded. Finally, two issues of immediate interest to the European Parliament were the Interinstitutional Agreement to improve the regulatory environment and, secondly, the regulation on the status of European political parties. With these two arrangements, we put an end to discussions which started a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this was the brief presentation of what was done during the Presidency and I should like to close by thanking, first of all, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pat Cox, for his cooperation, and all of you in the European Parliament. We consider that you are pivotal to promoting European integration and defending the Union's interests, which is why we aspire to close cooperation with you. And we had your direct support and cooperation in our work. I thank you warmly for your contribution, and I wish you all every success during the forthcoming Italian Presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the half-way stage of a year full of ambitious projects and intense debate on the nature and destiny of Europe. I would like, first of all, to heartily congratulate Prime Minister Simitis and all those who have worked alongside him to achieve our political and institutional goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on four of these goals: the conclusion of the work of the Convention, the Commission reforms, the substantial progress made in implementing the Tampere agenda and the new statute for European political parties. Before addressing them in detail, however, I must mention some of the other major events of the last six months: the winding-up of the accession negotiations – a momentous event which Prime Minister Simitis has already discussed – and the handling of the difficult internal and international situations caused by the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of our common agricultural policy also deserves a special mention, the agreement last week bringing these six months to a close on a high note. One of the essential elements in this success was the opinion issued by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, chaired by Joseph Daul, which I would like to thank heartily for its work. Despite the extremely complex and thorny nature of the issue, the committee managed to deliver its opinion in good time for the conclusion of the negotiations. This is a real innovation, for the decoupling of Community production subsidies, partial though it is, combined with land-management, environment and food-safety measures, is a genuinely revolutionary step for our agricultural policy. We now have a good springboard for entering the WTO negotiations, and I expect our international partners – who are always lecturing us – to match our commitment and do their part too, for they too must do their part.</p>
<p class="contents">In these six months, the Greek Presidency has steered us safely through the most troubled waters with that wisdom and sensitivity that has characterised the Greek people since the dawn of our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first point I wanted to mention, within the Union, the first half of the year was dominated by the work of the Convention, which was almost – although not completely – finished in time for the Thessaloniki European Council. We have found a method that has worked and that we could use to amend the Constitution if ever it needs to be revised in the light of the constant flow of new developments reserved for us in the future. As for the actual draft Constitution, there are positive and negative points in the Commission's eyes, as you know. It certainly makes the Union more transparent by simplifying and reducing the number of legislative instruments and by proposing a better division of powers between the institutions. It strengthens our democratic legitimacy by extending the codecision procedure so that it applies almost across the board, and this is something that is extremely important for Parliament. It increases our ability to make our voice heard in the world through a newly created foreign minister for the whole Union, through the establishment of a single legal personality and through new provisions on the foreign, common security policy and defence policy. Lastly the text of the Constitution now includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights safeguarding the rights of all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the high points, and they are very important high points, but there are also a number of weak points where the compromise brokered does not go as far as we would have liked. Although the draft Constitution extends qualified-majority voting, it certainly does not go far enough. The proposed solution carries the risk of paralysis in a 25- or 30-Member State Union. When it comes to the institutions, moreover, it will be difficult to convince the citizens that only half of the Commissioners should have a vote in the College, at least in such a complex phase in our institutional life as this. Furthermore, the potentially overlapping roles of the newly created position of President of the Council and President of the Commission will be just as hard to understand. Some advances in economic governance are made but it is imperative that we also set up the external representation of the euro, lack of which leaves the euro, without a doubt, more vulnerable and our economy more exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not just technicalities but issues which require us to muster the courage to overcome the misgivings and fears of the present and look to the future. We must realise that, if we do not make the leap today, Europe will no longer have any influence on the international stage in 30 or 40 years’ time. Viewed as a whole, however, the Convention's draft is a sound basis – and a joint effort which I support – for the Intergovernmental Conference that will have the task of approving a final version. The Commission will play its part in making improvements in this regard, starting with the opinion that will be published in September in time for the start of the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the reform of the Commission and the staff regulations. We are approaching the last year of the Commission's term of office. When I arrived, I made Commission reform one of my priorities, and I remember that we issued a White Paper as early as March 2000. A crucial part of this reform was an overhaul of the staff regulations for EU officials. Here, too, I must thank the Greek Presidency for driving forward these negotiations, which were, in actual fact, extremely difficult. Thanks to these valuable endeavours to mediate and drive forward the process, we reached a consensus on the best possible compromise, a compromise that respects – and I would stress this – the general approach of the Commission's initial proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As a follow-up to this agreement, the Commission will submit a second proposal in the autumn that will, of course, take account of this House's resolution of 19 June 2003 and the talks between representatives of staff, institutions and the Member States taking place in the consultative committee. The aim is to bring the new regulations into force on 1 May 2004, the same day on which the new Member States will become part of the Union. In addition to this goal, however, I am interested in the ultimate political aim of the exercise, which is to ensure continuity, independence and quality in our departments. I have to say that I have worked with many administrations in my life, and rarely have I encountered such hard-working, high-calibre employees as I have observed in the EU institutions. I therefore believe that the new staff regulations will allow our staff to work with renewed energy and pride, especially when their colleagues from 10 new Member States arrive. It will not be an easy matter to absorb new cultures, precisely because 10 countries are arriving together, not just one.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I want to focus on is immigration and asylum policy and the management of the Union's external borders. The Commission would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on sustaining a consistent and balanced position on these matters. Moreover, I am happy to note that the European Council conclusions were inspired by the Commission's communications of 4 June.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, looking at the issues still on the table, I would point out that Community financing should gradually rise to match the scope of our political goals and objectives. In other words, on no account can we pretend to be able to achieve all the goals we have set ourselves with the funding we have come up with. We have, of course, produced an estimate of resources which does not exceed the limits of the budget – we have remained strictly within the limits of the budget – but we have estimated the resources needed at EUR 140 million for the years 2004 to 2006, and at EUR 250 million for a multiannual cooperation programme with non-Member countries over the period 2004 to 2008. This will take us through to the new funding provided under the post-2006 Financial Perspective, which, as the Thessaloniki conclusions confirm, must reflect this political priority of the Union. Otherwise, clearly, if we do not succeed in giving the citizens security, we will be jeopardising the very identity of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as relations with third countries are concerned, the new programme of cooperation proposed by the Commission on 11 June will provide substantial support for the common readmission policy, which is another milestone, and it is crucial that you and the Council approve this proposal before the end of this Parliamentary term. Negotiation of Community agreements, with the support of the Council and the Member States, should also be stepped up. As I see it, Russia, Ukraine and Morocco, three key countries for these agreements, are the main priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has asked the Commission to proceed<span class="bold"> </span>towards integrated management of external borders, and we believe that the best solution is to set up an agency; this will make it possible to improve implementation of the Council's strategic guidelines, in agreement with the relevant national authorities, in such a way as to constitute a network of coordination. We are also laying the foundations for what is known as the VIS, the ambitious European Visa Identification System, which is also a common instrument for implementing a policy which will reassure our citizens and give them peace of mind with due regard for individual freedoms. Indeed, the main thing is to strike a balance between security and our commitment to upholding freedoms, a commitment which we have made, which we confirm and which we can on no account go back on. Combating illegal immigration must therefore go hand in hand with measures to facilitate the entry of legal migrants into the Union. In this connection, let me remind you that we already have some proposals on the table, notably those on admission and residence for purposes of work, study, vocational training of immigrants and voluntary work to facilitate integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already delivered an opinion on these proposals, which are still being discussed by the Council. The Commission welcomes the European Council's call to draw up an overall policy for integrating legal immigrants. We need better coordination of national measures at Community level as well. I feel that an annual progress report would certainly be a step in the right direction. There has been so much talk about benchmarking, dialogue and so on. I believe that, in such a complex matter where so many different factors are involved, a report taking stock at European level could be useful to both you and us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show the same political drive in the field of asylum. In this regard, I am very disappointed to have to report that the Council was unable to reach agreement on the directive defining the concept of refugee and harmonising subsidiary forms of protection. We must achieve this, again within the framework of the debate on rights which we mentioned just now. Indeed, this directive, together with the directive on procedures, is at the heart of the common system. I want to take this opportunity to promise that the Italian Presidency will have the Commission's full cooperation in getting these two directives adopted by December at the latest, the deadline set by the Thessaloniki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now come to the last point, the statute for political parties. We welcome the recent adoption of the statute for European political parties by this House. This is the fourth success of the Greek Presidency that I want to mention today. Let me add to the many others my own words of appreciation for your contribution in settling an issue which had become never-ending and which it was imperative to resolve. A number of factors have helped us achieve this result: the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, the new proposal drawn up by the Commission, the use of majority voting and, above all, first-rate cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The issue of political parties was a complex one that had remained unresolved for two years. This welcome settlement was achieved only thanks to majority voting and the codecision procedure. We must learn from this for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">At last, European political parties have a clear and transparent framework in which to work and can count on a source of financing that will be borne, at least partially, by the Community budget. This is an absolute prerequisite for running a democracy and a measure that is part of the broader process of putting European integration on a constitutional footing. The proposal adopted lays down some clear and simple conditions but avoids being overly restrictive or too formally bureaucratic, and so I feel it is a sensible measure which will have positive political effects. Indeed, as we all know, the political parties are the key element in the Union's democratic structure: without them there can be no integration and no European awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this brings me to the end of what I have to say today. As I said at the outset, there are many other issues worthy of mention but I think it is preferable to stop here so that we can focus properly on a few events of the past six months which have been of particular political importance. Lastly, I would like to thank Prime Minister Simitis and the entire Greek Presidency team once again. In these six months, they have taken some huge steps forward for Europe, and I am not praising and thanking this Presidency out of mere politeness but because they really do deserve it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the PPE part of which is today celebrating its fiftieth birthday, has consistently provided very positive support to the Greek Presidency, in close cooperation with our Greek colleagues under the chairmanship of Antonios Trakatellis, but also with our friends in Greece, Nea Demokratia under the leadership of Konstantinos Karamanlis. This is what we promised you in Athens, Prime Minister, and we have kept our word because we know that your success is our shared success.</p>
<p class="contents">The highlight of the Greek Presidency – and you were able to build on the good preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency and also on the European Parliament's decision of 9 April – was unquestionably the signature of the accession treaties on 16 April in the Stoa Attalou. When we alighted from the bus – and I should particularly like to thank you for inviting the group chairmen to this event, something that should set a precedent for other ceremonial occasions in the European Union – I had the good fortune to be able to accompany the first freely elected prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, down the steps at the side of the Acropolis to the Stoa Attalou, and we talked about the great change in Europe and the desire of the people of Central and Eastern Europe to live in freedom. The fact that the end of this process was marked as it were with the signature of the treaties in Athens is something that will never be forgotten, and we are grateful that we now have 162 observers with us from the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, your presidency has not just been a presidency of high points. As you mentioned yourself, your presidency has been overshadowed by the war in Iraq. I do not wish to look back in anger today either: I prefer to look to the future, and we must learn the lessons from the mistakes that we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first conclusion is that if national positions are to be adopted on an issue of foreign policy or if two or three countries wish to take a stance, then they are obliged first to consult all of their European Union partners and to resolve the issues together. We must act together and Europe, the European Union, must not go into these difficult decisions when it is already divided into two, three or four camps. Europeans must act together!</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the Convention. On certain issues, including our foreign and security policy, we must have the courage to decide by majorities, albeit by large, qualified majorities. If we keep unanimity we will not be able to reach common positions and this is one of our demands.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that clearly partnerships are not easy, particularly when one partner is a superpower. But it is precisely if we in Europe want to be on an equal footing with our American friends that this European Security and Defence Policy needs to be formulated in such a way that it does not see America as an opponent, but as a partner, a country together with which we wish to solve problems on this earth.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred quite rightly, Mr President-in-Office, to the difficult issues of asylum and immigration, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, whom I should also like to thank very warmly for his work, mentioned the joint administration of external borders. This is an important matter: we need to reach agreements with those countries from which these really pitiful people come, from which they set out in their boats, agreements in which they undertake to secure their borders. But I would insist that this is not solely a law enforcement issue, a task for the police. It is a problem that needs to be resolved above all in the countries of the Mediterranean and in North Africa, and that is why we need European Union assistance for these countries, and these countries have to reform so that the young people in them have a genuine future and do not put their lives in danger by setting off on their travels. We see this problem of immigration not only as a policing problem, but also as a fundamentally human problem and the key is to give people the chance of a future in their home countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point is the Convention. I should particularly like to thank its President, Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, for his work, but also the two Members in the Convention Praesidium, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo from our group and Klaus Hänsch from the Socialist Group, as well as our group spokesman, Elmar Brok.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now call for this draft constitution to form the basis for the work in the Convention and for the decision to be made in the Convention now on the basis of this draft constitution. We very much hope – and I will be saying this again tomorrow to the future President of the Council – that we can reach a result by the end of this year, so that swift and speedy progress can be made, and we also hope that the European Parliament will enjoy appropriate and effective representation. When the Heads of State and Government meet, the President of Parliament must be present; when the foreign ministers act, our parliamentary representatives should be there and not be as it were consigned to the level of administrators. The task before us is immense, but I believe that we can achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you in particular, Mr President-in-Office, for your contribution to the Statute for European political parties. Admittedly this still needs to be formally adopted under the Italian Presidency, but the approach adopted was, I believe, the right one. As far as the Members' Statute is concerned, I hope that it will be possible here too to make further progress in the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I say that this presidency has had its highs and lows: I did not envy your position as President during the Iraq crisis and all that went with it. I was pleased for you on 16 April; you did your duty, as we would expect from a presidency, and I should like to thank you very much for this. Our group has provided you with fair, objective and positive support; I hope that you share this impression, because this is our shared Europe and a success for Europe is a success for us all.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate the Group of the European People’s Party on their fiftieth anniversary. It is an important date for the PPE-DE and also for democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have a problem. It is difficult for me at this point to say anything more positive about the Greek Presidency than Mr Poettering and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> because my family ties and solidarity with the Greek Prime Minister are well known. I just want to say one thing, your Presidency has not been a cruise around the Aegean Sea, but rather an ‘Odyssey’. I believe it is fair to say, moreover, that you have captained the European ship with leadership and decisiveness, and I believe this should be stressed at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the thinking of the Presidency, firstly, with regard to enlargement, the ceremony of 16 April in the <span class="italic">Stoa</span>, in the Market Square next to the Acropolis, was an important event. I would like to thank you for the way you treated the representatives of the European Parliament, headed by our President, but above all I would like to thank you for the historic opportunity which took place in what was the cradle of democracy and also, in relation to an issue which is very close to the hearts of all Europeans and very dramatic for Greece – the case of Cyprus and relations with Turkey – the intelligence and flexibility being shown by the current Greek Government in establishing and developing relations with such an important ally.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the Lisbon strategy, I believe we must stress the implementation of the employment guidelines, particularly with regard to gender equality – and in this regard I would like to welcome the work being done by Commissioner Diamantopoulou. In the current situation we are largely concerned by the deadlock affecting the directive on temporary workers, as well as the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines are not responding to reality: they are more of an intellectual exercise than a political one, and they do not in fact respond to our need to make our European economy more dynamic and defend our common currency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should also stress, as the President has done, the progress that has been made on maritime safety, particularly in view of Greece’s role as the main European power. Furthermore, with regard to an aspect which is important to our economic future; the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I believe we should also welcome the fact that we have achieved a reform which puts us in a very significant position in terms of the future, particularly for European agriculture and also for the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future of Europe, the fact that the Convention has concluded its work during the six-month period is an important step, producing a text which does not contain options, which does not contain red cards, and which, as the President has said, and I take good note of this, only needs to be subjected to technical modifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we would have liked a constitution with more qualified majority voting in social areas, on taxation, on foreign and security policy and with a better interinstitutional balance. The best is the enemy of the good, however. We believe that the important thing now is to consolidate what has been achieved and not to move backwards. In this regard we are also concerned about the participation of Parliament. We believe that the President must be represented at the highest level, that we must have representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference and, furthermore, now that the future of Europe has been debated for the first time in public, in our Parliament as well, in plenary and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, this House must be the public forum which the Presidency is obliged to report to. I believe that this also corresponds to the times we are living in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add one further point on the Statute for Political Parties. All the parties and parliamentary groups have worked together to achieve a statute for the parties. Now, however, we are in the dramatic situation of having a statute for parties but no statute for Members of Parliament. This is like having rules for an army but not having rights for soldiers. I would genuinely like, therefore, to draw the attention of the Council Presidency to the fact that it makes no sense to block such an important step, which is of constitutional value to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on external relations. You have faced a dramatic crisis which tested the reciprocal loyalty laid down in the Treaties between European allies. You acted firmly with regard to transatlantic relations; you maintained European representation in a dignified manner at the summit with a very important ally with which we can have relations without agreeing on everything. I believe, therefore, that the Greek Presidency deserves our recognition and our applause.</p>

Given Europe's difficulties in the last six months with the Iraq war and economic stagnation, that is a remarkable tribute to your government.</p>
<p class="contents">Your first priority, rightly, was to meet the timetable for enlargement of the European Union. The signing of the Accession Treaties beneath the Acropolis and seven successful referenda have amply met this goal. Our joy at Europe's reunification is nonetheless tinged with sadness that Greece was unable to exploit its privileged relationships to bring in a united Cyprus. Please do not cease your efforts. We also regret the tensions which surfaced between 'new' and 'old' Europe over Iraq, despite your best efforts and two common positions to your credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty safely into port also deserves to be chalked up as a notable success of your presidency. The Liberal Democrats in this House agree with you. The draft text agreed by the Convention provides a good basis for the Constitution, and we will hold Member State governments to the commitments they have made.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the extra time given to the Convention to complete its work on Part III, though for the Council to describe the remaining discussions on majority voting and codecision as 'purely technical work' is a masterpiece of understatement worthy of the British Government's description of the whole process as just a 'tidying-up exercise'.</p>
<p class="contents">The vanity of victory teaches us far less than the humiliation of defeat and Europe's failure over Iraq seems to have had some beneficial consequences, notably in driving forward European cooperation in security and defence policy. The establishment of the rapid reaction force, the launching of operations in Bosnia, FYROM and the Congo are certainly pluses. However, the weaknesses in the quality and coordination of European defence spending are clearly negatives, which we hope will be remedied by the new Armaments Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Our failure over Iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at Thessaloniki: Mr Solana's EU security strategy and the Council's declaration on weapons of mass destruction. The security strategy provides a fitting European response to the US doctrine, resting as it does on the European principles of multilateralism and prevention rather than pre-emption. The statement on WMD makes clear to our American friends that we are taking the threat of these weapons seriously, and offers a framework for Europe's response to Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">You made Justice and Home Affairs the centrepiece of your presidency programme. Much has been achieved, though justice and freedom still play second fiddle to security, to the European Union's discredit. Commitments to further progress on legal migration and the integration of third country nationals are a fitting riposte to those who sought to repeat in Thessaloniki the kind of headlines which shamed Seville. However, my group regrets that you did not provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny, at European or national level, of the recent EU-US extradition agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic reform the Hellenic Presidency has made good progress, notably reforming the Stability Pact to target underlying deficits, concluding the energy liberalisation package and adopting the much-needed pensions directive.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, this has been a profitable six months for the European Union, despite the huge costs of war and the difficult economic position. Let us hope that, as you hand the baton to your successors, they too will run hard to keep up the Olympian lead that you have established.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in my speech I shall concentrate on a subject which was dealt with at the European Council in Thessaloniki, a subject that has hardly been mentioned up to now, but which is one of considerable scope. I too would like to talk about the document presented by Mr Javier Solana entitled ‘A Secure Europe in a Better World’.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions I have called in vain for a response from the European Union to the publication, on 20 September last year, of the new strategic doctrine of the United States, which was first applied in practice in the ‘pre-emptive’ war against Iraq. Nine months after Washington, therefore, the Council has just given birth to its own strategic doctrine. No doubt it is purely by chance that this text first saw the light on the eve of the Transatlantic Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, does this document say? Let me give you a few quotations. ‘With the new threats the first line of defence will often be abroad. The new threats are dynamic. Left alone, they will become more dangerous’. This quotation explains the meaning of that other enigmatic phrase contained in the document, ‘Pre-emptive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future. …. we should be ready to act before a crisis occurs’. Then, just in case things are still not clear, I quote again: ‘In failed states, military instruments may be needed to restore order …’ and, more generally, and still quoting, ‘We need to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid, and where necessary, robust intervention’. Finally, there is the inevitable, ‘Acting together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world’.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot believe our ears when we hear such mimicry of the ideas and even the language of the current tenant of the White House. If we can believe the press agencies, even Mr Prodi, in the crowd, showed his enthusiasm for President Bush by declaring that when Europe and the United States were united, no enemy would be able to stand up to them. On what basis, however, are we to be united, and for what purpose? That is the question, Mr Prodi! It is not by complaisance that we shall earn the respect of an American administration which despises Europeans, including the most conciliatory among them. Of that, for my part, I am convinced. Europe will exist as an essential actor on the world stage when it has the political will to use its economic clout, its political influence and its capacity for forming strong partnerships, particularly with the South, in order to help to create rules that are different from those that prevail at present, so as to achieve a globalisation with greater solidarity and greater democracy, and so as to create a peaceful world.</p>
<p class="contents">The document presented in Thessaloniki turns its back on such a prospect and gives us an apocalyptic description of the threats, without ever examining their causes in any depth. The conflict in the Middle East is dealt with in four and a half lines out of a total of fifteen pages of text. The concept of fighting for security that is described therein gives precedence to the military dimension, even though this approach has proved ineffective from Kabul to Baghdad, and even in the United States itself, whose vulnerability was so tragically emphasised on 11 September 2001, despite the fact that that country alone accounts for 40% of the world’s military spending.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the references in the Council document to the multilateral system have a hollow ring to them. After all, the main issues here have to do with the WTO, the international financial institutions and NATO. The United Nations is mentioned only in order to ask that in future the European Union should be ready, and I quote, ‘… to act when their rules are broken’. We can recognise, in this allusion, a call to order addressed to those member countries of the Security Council who opposed the ‘material breach’ argument quoted by George Bush as grounds for going to war with the backing of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, my group believes that the taking of this first step towards a new strategic doctrine of the European Union would be a turning point, the implications of which we would have to explain, and the dangers of which we would have to emphasise, to our fellow citizens. Given the power of the recent mobilisation of European public opinion, in both East and West, against the argument in favour of war and American supremacy, you can be certain that you will have to explain yourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask those Members who are motivated by the knowledge that it is civilisation that is at stake here, to join, at 3 p.m. today, in hearing the views, on this subject, of two eminent experts, one, Mr Pascal Boniface, from Europe, and the other, Mr Philip Golub, from America. Let us debate the issues with frankness, for it is the whole significance of the Europe of the future that is at stake.</p>

I should like to congratulate you on this achievement, Mr President-in-Office. Incidentally, you have proved that the principle of a six-monthly rotating presidency of the European Council is a creative and enriching force, and this is something that the future permanent Council presidency will have to prove.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chalkidiki Summit was also a success. This was not a foregone conclusion. The Heads of State or Government came together and nearly all of them had a long list of national ambitions that, even at the last minute, they wanted to salvage from the Convention's draft constitution. But when our Heads of State or Government saw each other they were deeply moved and left the Convention's draft in peace. This was a great success, except for the moment when it was decided to regard the Laeken mandate as fulfilled and to inform us – and I should now like to address this point, Mr President-in-Office – that Part III now only required some purely technical work. This was the first that we had heard of this: otherwise, why on earth are we continuing our work in the Convention in July? Because there was no consensus on the Praesidium's draft. Hundreds upon hundreds of amendments – 1 700 of them – have been tabled and not on technical issues. Essentially a very clear question is at stake in this work: namely whether we are going to deliver on the promises, values and aims set out in the first and second parts, whether we are actually going to make the competences, responsibilities and principles of democracy, that we enshrined by consensus in the first and second parts, a reality, or whether we are simply setting ourselves new objectives without freeing Europe from the chains of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to illustrate how critical this situation is with the aid of a few examples. In the first part, of course, we declare our overarching support for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, but in the third part there are still key areas where only the Council can legislate, for example on European social policy. National parliaments lose the right to ratify international treaties without this House gaining that right. In one of the most difficult cases, concerning the reduced powers of the European Court of Justice to supervise one of the most sensitive areas in the constitution, that of police and judicial cooperation on home affairs, 80% of the Convention have demanded the deletion of the exemptions. No policy without judicial control, no law without Parliament – these are clearly not technical issues, but issues of self-determination and the definition of Europe. The ability to act is a key principle, but in the last few nights of the Convention whole swathes of policy disappeared from the majority voting list and reappeared under unanimity. We were put under pressure by governments. The majority of the Convention wants more; the people of Europe want more. We know that the European public demand far more of Europe than the governments of Europe are willing to give. The Convention does not need to make technical decisions here; it needs to achieve fundamental reforms. Take public services of general interest, cornerstones of European social policy; the vast majority of the Convention want them to be explicitly protected in the constitution. So far this request has been turned down.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying this to belittle the work of the Convention or the current draft, but to make this House aware that a great deal of what we have enshrined in the first and second parts still needs to be delivered and that we will not be keeping our promises to the people if we do not make one further effort to bring about a genuine reform in the third part.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the Greek Government assumed presidency of the Union at a time of great international uncertainty and political instability. It was clear that at the start of this year different governments in Europe had diverse viewpoints when it came to facing up to the growing political problem of Iraq. The Greek Government sought to put in place in Europe a common political position on Iraq. This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The international difficulties which surrounded the war in Iraq were many, but I believe that in the context of its presidency of the European Union the Greek Government dealt with this difficult political matter as even-handedly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The last six months have also seen a great momentum in the work of the European Union Convention. The Greek Government has worked very closely with all the representatives on the EU Convention and this has contributed in ensuring a new draft Treaty that will pave the way for new structures within the Union. The Treaty forms the basis for future discussions at the IGC, which will finalise the provisions of a new European Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the internal structures operating within the European Union must be modernised and by 1 May next we are hopefully going to be living in a Community of 25 Member States comprising a population of over 500 million people. Decision-making procedures must change so that we can guarantee that decisions can be taken within the different EU institutions in a streamlined and structured manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to enact a new Treaty that will command the support of the people of Europe and which will oversee the smooth running of the European Union for the next 50 years. We must recall that the European Union has been a success because the interests and concerns of both the smaller and the larger Member States are respected within the institutional structure in Europe. In fact, the last six months have been testament to the fact that the smaller countries in Europe can run an effective and focused presidency of the European Union. This is an issue that we will return to again in the run-up to the next IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government has supported recent peace efforts in the Middle East. After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track. This is a matter that should not be left to the United States alone; the European Union has a very positive and central role to play in promoting the road map to peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend the Greek Government for the manner in which it has overseen the running of the presidency of the European Union for the past six months. The vast majority of the political goals that it set at the start of the year have been met and that is a commendable achievement. The Greek Presidency has set a good example of how a presidency should be conducted on behalf of all the Member States and others will do well to follow this example.</p>
<p class="contents">To the President-in-Office I would like to say that you have won respect and support from this institution for the semester. On a personal basis I would like to wish him some short period of relaxation in one of the many beautiful Greek islands which some of us had a opportunity of visiting in recent times, during the presidency. Might I suggest to President Simitis that I could recommend no place better than Platy Yialos and he would know what I mean when I say that.</p>

They too are making efforts to enter the EU. They will be sincerely welcome, and I am pleased that the EU Charter of Human Rights contains the recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities that is deserved by everyone in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU may have 25 Member States on 1 May of next year, and perhaps 30 in 2007 and 35 in 2010. The process may suddenly go very fast, because the countries concerned find it difficult to see any alternatives, given that, in practice, the EU also legislates for its neighbouring countries. We must reform the EU that much more quickly in order to obtain more supple and flexible decision-making structures suited to Europe in its entirety, with very big differences between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An Estonian language teacher can earn ten times as much by working in Brussels. It is not easy to secure a proper language education in Tallinn. It will be possible for MEPs from Prague to earn 20 times as much as their colleagues in the national parliament, so it will be no fun returning over the Charles Bridge in Prague. One hectare of land in the Netherlands costs 30 times as much as Polish agricultural land. It is scarcely Polish farmers who are buying up Dutch land. The majority of Polish slaughterhouses and dairies are to be closed down when the EU rules come into force. Why not be more flexible in introducing EU rules into the candidate countries and the new partnership countries. There is no one in the EU who is lining up to pay subsidies to unemployed slaughterhouse workers in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The high point of the Greek Presidency was the solemn signature of the agreements to extend the EU to include ten new Member States. Here we were in the cradle of democracy, welcoming a range of countries that could only enter the EU because they had become democracies. It is one of the Copenhagen criteria that countries can only be accepted when they have stable parliamentary democracies. That is why it is all the more absurd that the concluding summit in Haldidiki accepted the Convention’s draft constitution that would remove the greater part of democracy in both the new and the present Member States. In our case, power is not to reside with those who are elected but with people who were once elected and can now no longer be. When prime ministers can no longer be re-elected in their own countries, they can be appointed to lead us in Europe, without being answerable to the electorate. The national parliaments and the electorate are losing far more power than the EU is gaining, and that is not a guarantee of increased voter turn-out in the EU elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Hold referendums on the constitution in all the countries. Ask the voters if they want to participate less in elections. Imagine its being possible, in the birthplace of democracy, to accept Mr Giscard d'Estaing’s getting away with quoting Thucydides, when what the draft constitution does is precisely to remove power from the majority of the electorate in the Member States and give most of it to the bureaucrats in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also, to a large extent, the personal draft of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, because the other members of this Convention, after purely formal debates, have been left in total ignorance of a text essentially cooked up in secret by the Praesidium.</p>
<p class="contents">Claims that this is not so are mere propaganda, though this would be nothing unusual in Brussels circles. This text, which is unreadable to the uninitiated, is nothing more than a new attempt to create a centralised and unified European state, a sort of super-Maastricht. In fact, it employs various legal devices to increase the powers of Brussels, and it organises, amongst other things under the disguise of so-called shared competences, the sidelining of elected national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">No, Mr Badinter, the Eurosceptics have not had their final say yet! Consequently it will be for the next Intergovernmental Conference to show its opposition to these reveries and these ponderous statements, in particular by deleting from the draft treaty – if there is one – the words or expressions ‘constitution’, ‘constitutive’, ‘federal’ – perhaps the worst one of all – ‘law’ or ‘framework law’, ‘shared competences’, ‘subsidiarity’ – a synonym for ‘integration’ – ‘legal personality’, ‘reinforced cooperation’, ‘citizenship’ and, generally speaking, anything that falls within the scope of Article 308 of the current Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that some of the governments concerned – and not just the Government of the United Kingdom – will strongly oppose this attempt to overthrow the democracies for which they are responsible, and will do so without recourse to the illusory and temporary easy way out provided by ‘opt-outs’ or by some anodyne legal formula that will serve for all subsequent interpretations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall my party has been consistent and determined in its support for the enlargement of the Union, and we unreservedly welcome the positive results of the referendums that have already taken place in many of the accession states.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are less supportive of the presidency in other respects. On Iraq, the damage to transatlantic relations arising from the 'gang of four' summit, attended by Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, also severely undermined NATO. At a time when many of our citizens in Europe are facing economic stagnation and deflation, there has sadly been little progress in advancing the Lisbon agenda of economic structural reform. Instead, we have seen that we again prefer to devote most of our time to institutional reform, whilst persuading ourselves that this is the sort of progress that European citizens are crying out for. I doubt it. The presidency conclusions begin by stating that the Convention was successful in bringing our Union closer to its citizens, strengthening our Union's democratic character, enhancing our Union's ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system. I fear that such warm, optimistic rhetoric is little more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Convention's work have again shown the inability of a European political elite to reflect the real concerns of the people of Europe. We are asked to believe that what our citizens really want is an EU with a legal personality, a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, the removal of the pillar structure, an extension of majority voting, an EU president and foreign minister, common asylum and immigration policies and a European public prosecutor – in short, that people want a fundamental change in the relationship between the Union and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Prime Minister's now infamous view that the Convention is merely a tidying-up exercise has attracted derision from Eurosceptic and Europhile alike. I repeat today that the people of the United Kingdom have a right to a referendum on this constitutional treaty, just as other Member States intend to do. If the governments of the Union really wish to bring their citizens closer to the Union, then it is in their interests and those of their people to ensure that referendums are held in order to legitimise what is being proposed in their name.</p>
<p class="contents">My party believes in a different kind of Europe: a Europe where the nation state is the fundamental building block of cooperation and intergovernmentalism is preferable to one-way integration, which I fear is being reinforced by the Convention. It is a different kind of Europe to the integrationist agenda, but it is no less European for that. I wish the Convention had chosen this route. I hope that the governments of the Union look afresh at the results of the Convention when the Intergovernmental Conference begins its work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I noted that the presidency adds that the accession countries will participate in the Intergovernmental Conference on an equal footing with current Member States. I hope that means that they will be given the same voting rights as Member States. It would be outrageous for the IGC to conclude a new constitutional structure for Europe just weeks in advance of accession and try to present this as a done deal. No democrat should put up with that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was indeed an Odyssey which floated between the Circe of the war in Iraq – perhaps I should remind you that Circe was a wicked witch who had the ability to turn men into pigs – and the good goddess Calypso of the Convention on the Future of Europe which may guide the European Ulysses to the safe haven of the Europe of his dreams. As Europeans and as Greeks, we can be proud of this success, however unhappy we are about the incidents of war we had to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency undertook to address both the issue of Iraq and the differences which this war provoked between the Member States of the European Union and between the European Union and the United States. At the summit Councils in February and March, with the promotion and exploitation of the role of the United Nations, the European Union acquired a material presence on the international stage. Public opinion in the European countries recognised and welcomed the contribution by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is based not only on the principles of democracy, but also on the rejection in principle of war in international relations. The Member States, who have a very bloody history of conflict between them, no longer arm themselves against each other. These principles now need to be consolidated between the Member States, the candidate countries and Europe and its new neighbours as a whole. The Greek Presidency was persistent in its efforts to disseminate these principles in the new and sometimes dangerous areas of responsibility into which enlargement has led Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems in sensitive areas, such as Cyprus, which the Foreign Ministers in the area have called a sort of powder magazine of the Eastern Mediterranean, were addressed methodically and consistently. Cyprus, if there is the cooperation expected from the Turkish side which, unfortunately, there has still not been but we hope that there will be, can constitute a standard for the coexistence of different nations within the same state. In the same spirit, the Greek Presidency especially promoted the peace process in the Middle East. The current diplomatic procedures in this region are also the result of initiatives by the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">From a wider perspective, it is worth highlighting the guidelines given for the formulation of a new strategy by the European Union, which was worked out down to the last detail by the Council's High Representative. The promotion of European pacifist positions in the Western Balkans and the summit in Thessaloniki resulted, with its decisions, in a significant turn round in relations between Europe and the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">With these efforts the world did not become completely safe, but we can say that, thanks to these efforts, the Greek Presidency has bequeathed a much easier or, at least, less difficult task to its successor than it would have had without the methodical, consistent and sometimes inspired work of the Greek Presidency not intervened.</p>

The European Council was quite right to resist the temptation to deconstruct the Convention's work. The result would certainly be greatly inferior.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the revision of Part III is concerned, I am prepared to turn myself into a technician, pure or not, for the final phase of the work. I quite agree with President Prodi that it is vital to extend the scope of qualified-majority voting as far as we can if the Council is in the future to be able to enjoy the capacity to take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">But what about Part IV concerning the revision and the entry-into-force procedures? The European Council was completely silent upon this point. Was it brought up and, if so, what was said? Would Mr Simitis agree with me that unless we can modify the future revision procedures we will be forever trapped in the dual lock of unanimity plus national ratification procedures – frequently protracted and problematical? Surely it is desirable that the Union avoids putting itself inside such a straitjacket.</p>
<p class="contents">We must find a sufficiently flexible form of modifying the Constitutional settlement if we are to be able to move with the changing circumstances we will face in the years to come.</p>

<p class="contents">The increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions, the privatisation of social security and the extension of part-time and temporary employment were promoted. In the name of competitiveness, the general economic policy guidelines of the European Union were approved, the main feature of which is the attack on the workers in order to increase the profits of the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the Member States of the European Union were handed over to the United States bound hand and foot with the disgraceful agreements on judicial cooperation. The Greek Presidency aligned with the USA in its interventions in Cuba, with the pretext of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which proved to be non-existent, and the objective of oil, in order to impose the global sovereignty of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Greek Presidency, the European Union, despite the unprecedented protests of its peoples, found excuses for and ultimately legalised the savage attack by Anglo-American troops and the occupation of Iraq, with its well documented disastrous results for the Iraqi people. . Fortunately, the occupation is being resisted by the Iraqi people. Who the Greek Presidency was serving is clear from the warm congratulations of Messrs Bush and Powell, but also from the outcry by the peoples. On the pretext of crushing terrorism, further militarisation of the European Union was promoted, by completing the formation of the European army for imperialist interventions all over the world jointly with ΝΑΤΟ and the USA, as was the more general strengthening of the repressive mechanisms to armour the interests of big business inside and outside the European Union from hostile peoples. The idea of increasing military spending so that we are reliable partners of the American imperialists with whom, it is said, we are united by common values, also advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term review of the CAP was approved, reducing and uncoupling subsidies from production, with disastrous consequences for small and medium-sized farmers, quality and the environment. The strengthening of fortress Europe was promoted with new expulsions of immigrants and stricter terms of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The signature of the enlargement of the European Union marks new hardships for its peoples and legalises the division of Cyprus as a result of the invasion and occupation by the army of Turkey, which is a candidate for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, during the Greek Presidency an abortive text was approved, the creation of an anti-democratic Convention, which strengthens the pro-monopoly, anti-working class character of the European Union, the power of the strong and the militarisation of the European Union, in order to claim a more active role within the frameworks of international imperialism at the side of the USA. Mr Simitis and his friends are proud of all this. We are angry and we are extending our fight with the peoples against these policies. Each of us shall serve his cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the Greek Presidency most sincerely for having shown that this is completely false. It has been the case during the last five years that the small-country presidencies have proved to be models of how this system can work. We should take pride and pleasure in that and congratulate the Greek Presidency on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Friday, at a meeting in London, a document produced by the London Office of the European Parliament remarked that the Convention was proposing that the Council should have a permanent, powerful presidency. Anybody who believes that ought to have a look at the draft text. The presidency of the Council will have no constitutional powers. The Council is denied any power of legislating. The Council may – and ought to – have influence, but the idea that the presidency will be 'powerful' is a great mistake. Since it will be a presidency chairing a meeting of prime ministers and heads of states, it will not be so much a case of <span class="italic">primus inter pares </span>as of less than <span class="italic">par inter primos</span>, unlike the position of the President of the Commission in future, for which again I am glad.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have rightly heard a certain sense of alarm about the dual presidency, it may not be as bad as it sounds, like the music of Wagner.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Convention I had the honour of representing – as alternate member – the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and in particular the European Free Alliance subset representing the stateless nations of Europe – the small countries. I rejoice, as I said the other day, to see the flags of the new countries that come in. But not all the little countries of Europe are as yet – or intended to be – Member States of Europe. It is therefore vitally important to ask ourselves, as we contemplate a new constitution for Europe, about the future position of Catalonia (comparable in size to Hungary), of Scotland (comparable in size to the Slovak Republic), of Galicia or Wales (comparable in size to Latvia). What will be the way in which this Union works?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Gaulle was happy to pour contempt on the idea of subsidiarity. If we do not recognise that this is going to have to be a Europe of democracy at many levels, which takes subsidiarity seriously and takes it in a transitive sense right through the Member States, to all the countries of Europe, it will not work. I hope that will not be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that respect, it could thus be said that a political process which began at the Laeken Council has come full circle. At Laeken, less than two years ago, the Heads of State or Government decided to set up a convention whose aim was to consider the main problems facing the future development of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the Convention’s task was to draw up a final document which under the terms of the Laeken conclusions themselves, may – and I quote – ‘comprise either different options, indicating the degree of support which they received, or recommendations if consensus is achieved.’. Very much under the impetus of its President, the Convention rose to this challenge issued at Laeken by seeking out a third way. This consisted of drawing up a complete draft Constitutional Treaty, a kind of closed structural framework for the future of the Union. It is worth saying that the text of the Convention was not a consensual one and nor could it have been. Without going into detail, we must recognise that there were many contradictions, controversies, omissions as well as successes which, taken together, resulted in a necessarily imperfect synthesis. This synthesis will put to the test the ability of governments of Member States to cooperate and take decisions at the next Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). This is why the Convention’s work was rightly considered by the Council to be a mere starting point, not a final destination. A good starting point, it is true, but no more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to outline two final points. The first is to note that, if the solution favoured by the Convention for the future of the Presidency of the European Council goes ahead, the Greek Presidency will remain inextricably linked to the beginning of the end of the excellent democratic practice, carried out every six months here in the European Parliament, of assessing the work of the Presidencies. These regular debates on major European issues will come to a ruinous end without the least profit or advantage being drawn from it, as far as I can see. To my mind, the opposite is the case. This is undoubtedly due to my own shortcomings, but that fact does not prevent me from expressing one desire. This is the desire that the balance-sheet of the Greek Presidency that we are drawing up today should not be a final balance-sheet, the beginning of the end of a way of undertaking the Presidency of the Union which we consider crucial to safeguarding equality between Member States. To sum up, and I will end on this second point, we would like to congratulate the Greek Government on the excellent results of its completed Presidency. We are sorry, however, that this is the last time we will be able to pass on our congratulations to Greece in the same circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we ask the public to be enthusiastic about the creation of a super-minister for Foreign affairs – suddenly appointed Vice-President of the Commission – or about the appointment of a President of the European Council, or about all these texts which either are totally beyond their comprehension or have a hollow ring to them?</p>
<p class="contents">Should there be more competences for Europe, for more Member States? Very well, but which budgets are going to pay for them? Should we have more qualified-majority votes? What will we use them for? Mr Blair sees this as the condition for greater liberalisation, while others, on the same side of the political chessboard, believe that it is the condition for the advent of social Europe. One does not have to be a genius to see that some people are going to be disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft constitution, which seeks to smother individual states, is, in my opinion, incompatible with democratic expression. I do not want to see our states, deprived of their decision-making powers, become mere regions of Europe. The Convention did not need the mandate of the people for that purpose. This draft constitution, drawn up by an unrepresentative Convention, has no legal value and even less added value for our citizens. I hope that the final text will enable the national parliaments to control subsidiarity effectively so that Europe no longer has a say in everything.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, it will be up to the people to decide, by means of a referendum, whether they accept the idea of disappearing into a European-style democracy constructed out of nothing, thereby still giving the lion’s share to an all-powerful democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is an interesting expression, because it demonstrates that even though the Convention has done a lot of work on clearing the way, there is still a long way to go before we arrive at an acceptable text. The Intergovernmental Conference, which will have more than six months ahead of it before 1 May 2004, will have to work in three directions, and I am speaking here both to the incoming Italian Presidency and to the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the proposed text does not maintain the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the mechanisms of cooperation and, on the other hand, respect for national sovereignties, which are the two pillars of the original Community method. If the truth were told, this unbalanced text is sliding towards a predominantly supranational system, a super-state which will cut Europe off from its peoples even more.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it will be necessary to carry out a serious review of Part III, which the Convention has not even looked at yet, and which it will only be able to correct, before 15 July, on its technical aspects alone. Yet very important issues of principle are still outstanding. For example, it is impossible to leave as it is the section concerning agriculture, because in no way does it mention our current objectives, namely the preservation of our model, self-sufficiency in food, food safety and nature conservation – all objectives which can only be achieved by multi-functional, and preferably regional, agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it will be necessary to rewrite the preamble, because it contains two vital omissions. Firstly, and this is unbelievable, it does not say a single word about nations, except for a vague allusion to national histories. Yet a nation is not simply past history. It is, above all, the most important political reality experienced by our fellow-citizens and the most effective framework for modern democracy. Secondly, the preamble does not say a single word about Christianity either, and yet surely it deserves at least equal mention with humanism, not only as a historical reference point, but above all as the belief in God of the majority of Europeans. Therefore on two essential points, nation and Christianity, the current preamble refrains from mentioning what constitutes the very essence of Europe. This is inadmissible, Mr President, in a supposedly formal document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are here to criticise the work of the Presidency of the Council constructively, honestly and in good faith on the basis of your report. I shall focus my attention mainly on the issues on which no progress was made, not in order to grumble, but because it is good for us to remember the things that were not done, so that we can put them in order and make progress with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that there was a delay in the immigration sector, because there is not one word in the conclusions of the summit Council about the question of setting up a European border guard, while the Commission is absolutely convinced about it and has announced it. Why this standstill on such an acute problem? Similarly, the issue of financial solidarity and an equal division of the burden in the immigration sector has essentially been lost, even though it was also a priority of your programme, in that no special funding means have been adopted, as proposed by the Commission. Similarly, I would say that the common European asylum system was not introduced and, finally, we have no readmission agreements. What readmission agreements were concluded? How can 2 000 to 3 000 illegal immigrants from a country which maintains relations with the European Union, I am talking about Turkey of course, be caught and readmission not be accepted? Readmission applications are being made – if I remember correctly over 1 400 – and only 14 have been accepted. Where is the strength and will of Europe on such an important issue, which has not only economic, but also, more importantly, humanitarian consequences. I would hasten to emphasise that guarding the external borders of the Union would also help in the foreign policy and security policy sector, where the Union is suffering, because this precisely constitutes the cornerstone of foreign policy and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, on the Lisbon strategy I cannot but find that the political and economic uncertainties remain. The prospects for sustainable development in Europe appear to be a distant hope.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reform of the CAP, I believe that you realise that the debate on the mid-term review carried out has not been completed, in that a series of products have not been included in the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the future of Europe is concerned, I absolutely agree with President Prodi that the Constitutional Treaty does indeed contain some very important and positive points; however, it also contains certain elements which give a great deal of cause for concern. I shall start with your phrase, that we share the future in a Community of values, to ask, how do we share the future? Divided into blocs of large and small countries, with the reinforced ability of the former to affect decisions? With duality? Double structures? In other words, something which the most simple company or government official knows leads to adversity, confusion and, ultimately, inefficiency? Or by cutting the right of each Member State to equal representation by a Commissioner in the Commission? Under these conditions, how will the interest of countries and, above all, their citizens, be maintained? And what Community of values? The Community in which it is not the Community model of the European Union but intergovernmental cooperation that is being extended? And, finally, what values? Those which we do not dare refer to expressly in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, offering the citizens – whose support we crave – the political education and values of a last-minute compromise? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the Greek Presidency took the best possible reaction to the division which the European Union underwent in relation to this issue in convening the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels on 17 February 2003 and with the outcome of that Council.

Firstly, like you we welcome the fact that the military part of the ESDP is now fully ready for deployment and that three operations have already been given the go-ahead or even begun, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even with the Convention's proposals, we have not overcome the structural problems with the CFSP and ESDP. The principle of taking decisions by unanimity stands in contradiction to the very concept of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the European Parliament is not involved in this policy, despite being the source of ideas and driving force behind it for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU/NATO agreements are certainly important and also necessary at this time. However, we already need to start considering how we are going to develop the capabilities that we lack, primarily in terms of transport and reconnaissance.

That is what they all want, as long as that voice is their own. If they do not let go of this attitude, little will change, despite the Convention and despite Mr Solana’s interesting document. There is little one can say in the way of criticism about his analysis, but therein lies at the same time its weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">The report speaks about what unites us but is silent about what divides us, and that, in practice, is precisely the problem with 25 Member States. The threats in an enlarged Union do not only lie beyond Europe’s borders but also within them. We can see eye to eye with Mr Solana at the abstract level, but God forbid that this should become a little more concrete. I fear, above all, an internal rift about the attitude with regard to America’s role in the world, and hence about how to tackle the major breeding grounds of conflict. Mr Solana is right to say that an effective European Union could have a considerable impact, one that is conducive to a fair, safe and multilateral world. We must develop our own security policy, but we have not managed to do this to date, unfortunately. The Iraq crisis was not only about Iraq, but also about a new distribution of power in the world and inside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the fall of the wall, external policy in the European Union has been re-nationalised. Heads of Government, especially those of major Member States, seek to compensate for the loss of national sovereignty and identity in many areas by raising their own national profile in the area of foreign policy. Unfortunately, the Convention bears out current practice by maintaining the rule of consensus. Even the voice of a European super-Minister for Foreign Affairs can only be heard when the cacophony of his national colleagues has fallen silent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is very good. However, you did not succeed in laying down a timetable. I greatly fear that we shall not anticipate the new conflicts on their way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the invasion of Iraq has been followed by military occupation, with the logic behind a military occupation, men in balaclavas, police spies and so on. The occupying forces are, as we learned yesterday, building a new Guantanamo. Politically, what do we say to these gentlemen, whom we sometimes call allies and certain of whom are also members of the European Union? I do not understand. I do not think that we resolve any problems by politically appeasing allies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: you have signed an agreement with the USA. The European Parliament accused you on the grounds that this was democratic infringement. The article which you chose excludes the parliaments; however, it says that the Member States can express objections if their internal order so requires. Will Greece do so?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, the matter of the Constitutional Treaty really did progress, but with opaque and, in my opinion, very dangerous procedures, which may even change the essence of everything the Convention has done. Question: how will we safeguard the politicisation of the unification of Europe and the limited cooperation which can give impetus to those who really want to do something different against American efforts to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator? Will Greece hold a referendum as part of this effort at politicisation?</p>

This is to be welcomed, and I know we will return to this many times in the future. We particularly welcome the statement in Paragraph 2 that 'weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation puts at risk the security of our states, our peoples and our interests around the world'. However, I regret that meeting this challenge is only taken up in terms of European Union external action. We should hope that the efforts regarding non-proliferation will apply to all states already in possession of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and those which may develop the capacity, and not just states which are seen as unfriendly, as opposed to those which our foreign policy supports.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to other questions, my group certainly welcomes the efforts made by the Greek Presidency on the question of temporary agency work, currently blocked through more political game-playing by particular Member States. It is clear that we need more progress on workers' rights and the implementation of existing rights, for example in terms of mass redundancies, as in the case of Schiesser-Palco in Athens, and the questions about retraining and social protection which follow that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council really needs to start questioning whether Lisbon is working as well as people think it is in terms of the provision of high-quality jobs and the social cohesion which was sought at Lisbon. In one of those areas we need to look at the relationship between that and the World Trade Organisation agreements and proposals we are currently following, and to see whether we will be able to safeguard social and environmental rights within the European Union and encourage and support such development in poorer countries under the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to pick up the question about tax evasion, which the Prime Minister mentioned, and hope that future presidencies – I do not hold out much hope for the next one – will look at this question of tax evasion within the European Union and beyond it, because at the moment we are losing fortunes from our public budgets due to the non-payment of taxes by corporations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, on this extremely serious issue, the European institutions continue to suffer, so to speak, from an endemic reluctance across the board to address, head-on, the challenge represented by the activity of the criminal Mafia organisations which organise the despicable trafficking of human beings, which frequently causes tragedies such as those portrayed on television screens in the houses of all European citizens throughout the world, where a picture is painted which certainly discredits the European institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a number of questions on this matter which were not clearly raised at the Thessaloniki Summit. Europe is not addressing the relationship between illegal immigration and terrorism, and yet Al Qaeda members are identified daily in the ghettos of illegal immigration. Just recently, a criminal network has been identified in my country whose members have even penetrated the reception centres. What if, instead of merely aiding the criminal trafficking of illegal immigrants, these had been members of Islamic terrorist organisations? Furthermore, why are adequate health protection measures not laid down, not least in the interests of the immigrants, given the extremely unstable health situations endemic in the countries and regions of origin of illegal immigrants? Consider the situation in Algeria, with the plague crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, has Europe considered, or does it intend to consider, the need to protect, not least from the point of view of protecting the Union and its natural resources, areas such as the islands and coastal regions of southern Italy, where illegal immigrants leave the ships of traffickers? The island of Lampedusa, with its extraordinarily beautiful countryside – one of the last strips of European land before Africa – and the Costa Domiziana<span class="italic"> </span>are parts of our European heritage which are unique in their beautiful scenery. For how much longer must they continue to be transformed into reception camps for floods of illegal immigrants? In this sense, the UK proposal to place reception centres outside Europe’s borders is to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will also forever associate it with a sense of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also see, however, that this presidency saw a great failure on the part of Europe – not that the Greek Presidency is responsible for this; we all are – namely the inability of us Europeans to have a common position on an issue of war and peace. Lessons were learnt from this and it gave the Convention impetus to make perhaps greater progress on aspects of the foreign, security and defence policy than we had initially thought possible. This is also true of the discussions on a strategic concept for the European Union that have been taking place and will continue in Thessaloniki, so that we are better prepared in terms of content in the future and have our own system for weighing up interests, from which a better operational policy will emerge at Community level in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware that what has been achieved in the Convention is marred by several mistakes. At the last moment the Convention's courage failed it and in its final 14 days it clearly does not wish to try to move more foreign policy issues to majority voting. The idea that in the future one country would be able to block 25 others on an issue of foreign policy, with no way out, is a painful one, and there is the risk of an opportunity being missed. I would ask you once again, Mr President, to define what is meant in the Thessaloniki Conclusions in respect of Part III by purely technical work, so that we can make progress on majority decision-making – particularly in foreign policy but also in other areas – and so that this does not serve as an excuse for our not being able to discuss anything further.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals that have been made by government representatives in the Convention seem at least not to be technical, when I look at the proposal that the German Foreign Minister has tabled on behalf of the Federal Government about a foreign service. If a footnote in Part III – this being declared to be technical – leads to our own foreign service being set up, drawing its staff from the Commission or the Council and including national civil servants, under the exclusive competence of the foreign minister, this will constitute a dramatic change in the balance between the institutions and a dramatic weakening of the Commission and ultimately also of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for us now to create further bureaucracy for the important position of foreign minister. Ours is a twofold task: we are to merge areas and not create anything new that will make life even more difficult in the future and will be harder to monitor. We do not need any new fiefdoms; instead we need to integrate areas and I hope that attempts will be made with your help to gain control of this. I would therefore urge you to help us in this matter, and I would ask you once again to define the word 'technical', so that we can still make progress in the Convention this week and next, and in this context also to tell us why Part IV cannot be touched. The Convention has not yet debated Parts III and IV. It should have the right to do so, and governments should not prevent it from doing so.</p>

Compared to the Seville conclusions, I find it genuinely interesting, although, having heard Mr Borghezio, I am wondering whether my analysis may be mistaken. Seriously, I believe that the Council has returned to a more global and balanced vision of immigration, reducing the decibels of its declarations, but in a more measured way increasing the intensity of the measures adopted. I take a positive view of the option of guaranteeing border control by means of a Community operative structure for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Border control is necessary, but it is only one part of immigration policy, Mr President, and it has its limits: in terms of security, because criminals do not normally use their documents or cross borders by the usual routes, and in terms of the management of migratory flows, because the majority of immigrants currently residing in Europe, without documentation, crossed the borders originally in a legal fashion, as students, with an initial work permit or as tourists, but the border was crossed legally in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the situation at maritime borders is dramatic and people have a very negative perception of it, since they feel subjected to a dual tension: fear of a phenomenon which appears to be out of control, and a tremendous compassion which we all feel when we see, sometimes, bodies reaching our coasts. In terms of numbers, however, this is very limited compared to the overall phenomenon of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere element is needed, and its application does not require money, but does require political courage. It is also necessary to create a common legislative framework for legal entry and for the harmonisation of asylum. Similarly, readmission agreements are just one part of the relationship with third countries. We should use a little imagination so that, in a world such as ours, in which everything has the potential to move within a global framework, the movement of people can become a virtuous circle, generating a little wealth for third countries, for our neighbours and for us. We will need this imagination.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, please allow me to end by congratulating you on having accepted, for the first time, the need for a European integration policy and on having correctly identified its objectives and the need to implement them with local and regional authorities and social actors. We have a lot at stake in this field. The co-existence of our Member States is at stake. I only hope – and I congratulate you on your Presidency – that your successors will deal with this issue with the same care as you.</p>

In an important presidency conference on the theme in Athens and in securing agreement on the family-reunion and long-term-residents directives you have gone some way to rebalance the EU agenda which has been much too focused until now on control and rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's role in offering refugees protection has been under assault from some governments, notably the UK. I am glad that Thessaloniki rejected the preposterous suggestion that all EU asylum seekers should be driven back towards the Third World or EU fringe countries. The prospect of vast detention camps, raising the spectre of concentration camps, was rightly a step too far for some Member States. We need to get order in our asylum systems with a common EU system that does not shift responsibility but shares it. This would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another sees its numbers peak.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only have a true partnership on migration with third countries if we offer their people adequate alternative opportunities, especially in agriculture. The CAP with its export subsidies and import protection is a gross barrier to trade justice. You have made some reform progress but not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mr Watson rightly deplored the manner and content of the EU-US legal cooperation and extradition agreements. I agree with him. However, I welcome that the summit issued a clarion call of strong support for the International Criminal Court. The EU must stand up to the outrageous US bullying to undermine the court.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the accession signing ceremony took place at the foot of the Acropolis where the new Parthenon museum is also located. I represent London where the British Museum is located, but I take a rather softer line than its director on the so-called Elgin Marbles and I hope some arrangement for transfer, even if only a loan, can be reached before next year's Olympics.</p>

<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say once again that, without a clearly-affirmed social dimension, without any real rules for urban and rural planning across Europe, without any major European public services, without the attributes of a real European citizenship which respects the need for pluralism and the real diversity of our histories, cultures and traditions, yes, without all that, Europe is condemning itself to disillusionment, a disillusionment which will no doubt, in time, prove to be fatal to its very existence. The IGC must therefore improve the draft Convention on these points, so that what is being called the new Treaty of Rome really does open the door to a European Europe, a social Europe and a Europe of citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this, the impression is created that the process is currently going hand in hand with less stringent criteria. In the past, we most definitely did not want to set down any dates for the start of negotiations, the end of negotiations or for accession to the European Union. Nowadays, dates are being suggested quite spontaneously which, in themselves, are also being interpreted in all kinds of ways. With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, our resolution was reported to state initially that we appreciate it that those countries have set themselves a target date, namely 2004. We have not given an opinion either way, but we are increasingly hearing that we assume that the negotiations can be finalised by the end of 2004. One cannot help wondering whether conditions are also being prescribed for the implementation of what is being laid down in law.</p>
<p class="contents">Will, for example, Romania be a country that functions normally by 2007, or will it still be weighed down by corruption and political power-play that overlook the interests of the general public? We never imagined that what we used to call the two waves would follow each other in such quick succession. We are therefore surprised about those dates 2004-2007 for Romania and Bulgaria. The western Balkans and Kosovo are also being mentioned in the same breath. I should note in this connection, and it must be patently clear to the authorities in Kosovo, that nobody here wants an ethnically-based Member State. Could this be a case, perhaps, of misplaced guilt in respect of the candidates left behind? This feeling is not present among Union citizens. The people have become more critical; the importance of a well-functioning Europe has become greater. The economic political problems of the new accession states have also grown and meanwhile, it seems as if the Council and Commission have become more lenient.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, as the President-in-Office of the Council also mentioned there is the largest potential enlargement: the accession of Turkey. Unfortunately, a date has also been set for the start of negotiations while no conditions have been laid down for this. According to Turkey’s interpretation, this is an unconditional date.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be unfortunate if the Council and the Commission were susceptible to Turkey’s criticism that they are not reacting quickly enough and that surely, Turkey has now waited long enough, while it is we who have waited for the changes in Turkey to take place. Luckily, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the minorities, religious freedom and the position of the army. The Commission on its part has promised an inquiry into the role of the army. This strikes me as extremely important, provided this does not simply look into the extent to which the current situation at the start of the negotiations about other chapters can be maintained as much as possible. It appears to me that a priority has been set here which we must handle with the greatest of care. We must also deal with the changes in Turkey required by us with due care. These cannot simply be made in the course of a few years without causing major damage. We should not be guided by a fear of driving Turkey away in this. After all, the introduction of quasi-Iranian conditions is probably the last thing the army will allow. This calls for staying power and caution. The solution to the Cyprus problem, in particular, will be one of the benchmarks for Turkey’s accession, because that is where the army’s role is felt most acutely. The Balladur initiative on borders and good neighbourliness are, in fact, the basis for Copenhagen’s political conditions. It would be naive to think that no country would use its veto if Cyprus were not re-united. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ministers will know that I do not say this just out of politeness because I have also voiced friendly criticism of some aspects of the Greek legal system. I did so, for instance, when a constituent of mine – Mr David Wilson – who is now facing an appeal in the Greek courts, was arrested and sentenced within 24 hours of his arrest to 12 years in jail, after some stowaway asylum-seekers were found hidden at the back of his lorry without his knowledge. So you know that my praise is genuine because sometimes I do not hesitate to criticise.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue of the period of the Greek Presidency is the constitution. In the long run that will be the most significant thing. I congratulate the presidency on getting the form of words agreed in Thessaloniki – that the constitution will be the basis for the negotiation of a new treaty in the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has not quite finished its work. Part III, at least, is going to be subject to a technical revision: such technicalities as how to vote in the Council, the technique of voting by QMV or unanimity. That shows that technicalities can sometimes also be of the highest political significance. It is important that progress be made on that. But once we have a completed result from the Convention the battle then moves on to getting it intact through the IGC. The IGC must not unravel the Convention, must not pick it apart. As soon as we start moving one little bit of the constitution, there will somebody else who wants to remove another bit of it, and the whole thing could fall apart. On the contrary, we must all unite to say that this must be the basis on which we move forward. If there are going to be changes they should only be small, detailed and technical changes to the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reference in the conclusions of Thessaloniki to the participation of Parliament in the IGC. The details still need to be spelt out but we now have an <span class="italic">acquis</span> from the Amsterdam and Nice negotiations that the European Parliament participates via its President in the meetings at the level of ministers and via two representatives at the level of the working group that does the negotiating. That at the very least should be the basis on which Parliament participates in this IGC.</p>

<p class="contents">Three major issues have dominated this period as they do this debate: enlargement; the war in Iraq and the significance that it has had for Europe and will also continue to have in the future, and the Convention. Enlargement – the great historic project of our generation – is well on the way to being completed successfully. For us enlargement already has a human face, in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers. As an aside, I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion, which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Iraq made it clear where Europe's borders lie and showed where we need even more Community: primarily in the field of foreign and security policy. So far Europe has played no role at all here or at best a pitiful one. It really should strike people that where Europe uses the Community method, such as on internal market issues, we operate on an equal footing with for example the United States of America, but that where we work on an intergovernmental basis, we play no part at all. This has to change in the future and the Convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this. I hope that it will still succeed in doing so before 10 July of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the draft Constitution, whose preparation Greece showed it could oversee so clearheadedly, makes a decisive contribution to European history. After a period of national constitutionalism, we are now witnessing a period of European constitutionalism. Moreover, though sceptics may criticise this European constitutionalism, which will not replace national constitutions. Instead, it represents a break, a highly creative shift in the European spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has also, however, shown itself worthy of the classical humanism as expressed by Gorgias, who said ‘man is the measure of all things’. It also showed it could resist those who wanted to turn immigration policy into a tool of repression against those immigrants who are attracted to Europe as a land of work, prosperity and peace. Greece showed that it could resist, furthermore, by pointing the way to a suitable immigration and asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When confronted with the storm over Iraq, the war in Iraq, moreover, Greece showed it could remain upright and clearheaded, and could once again point to the way forward, which took the form of an independent European defence policy and identity, still within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. Greece, which, we should remember, invented the democratic city-state in ancient Athens, showed that it could contribute decisively to developing and strengthening a new form of democracy, typical of the European character: the European Union on a continent-wide scale. Greece showed it could also contribute to that process of enlargement by proposing that the western Balkans join the European Union in the long term. In the same way, Greece, and especially its prime minister, Mr Simitis, showed it could restore its troubled relations with Turkey. It showed it could move beyond their historic dispute and prove that nations do not have to be permanently at war. Greece showed it could open up to Turkey, that great country which has always been present on the European political scene, in the good times and in the bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one reservation: the CAP, which perpetuates serious inequalities in the distribution of resources between farmers and countries. Lastly, the Greek Presidency showed it could reconcile the world of Platonic ideas with Aristotelian realism. The art of politics in Greece cannot be separated from philosophy, just as the art of politics in Europe must not be separated from philosophy either, otherwise it will always be susceptible to the temptations of religious fundamentalism and repressive ideologies. The spirit of Europe today is the spirit of Greece, and the spirit of Greece is the spirit of Europe. It is my earnest wish that the future permanent presidency of the European Union, which I support, unlike so many, will always show it can be like the Greek Presidency. I hope that the latter will be an example for the permanent presidency of the European Council in future.</p>

I should immediately like to follow this up with the comment that this is yet another example of how small countries often make better presidents than large ones, and that we should not be so quick to give large countries priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is a case in point. You have dealt with a number of very heavy dossiers, and the finalisation of the accession dossiers on the Acropolis on 16 June gave us a stunning picture, also for those who were only able to follow the proceedings on television. I do not think we could have imagined a more beautiful spot and a more beautiful image. It was, of course, coincidental that these dossiers happened to be finalised during the Greek Presidency, but it was a very happy coincidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention’s work has also been guided in a very positive manner. Greece assumed a hands-off approach and gave latitude to the Convention itself. I myself was – indeed, I still am – a member of that Convention, and I can vouch for the fact that the result that is now before us is mainly due to the way in which the MPs and MEPs have joined forces. The MEPs and members of the national parliaments worked together much more effectively than some government representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, therefore, the risk that the governments are going to put a spanner in the works. An amazing amount has been achieved: values and standards have been established, the Charter has been adopted, the pillars have disappeared, decisions will be taken by qualified majority more often, democratisation has moved on by quite a long way, parliamentary control has been stepped up, transparency enhanced and the institutional structure improved, the only discordant note being that we are now, after all, getting a President, something that many did not actually want.</p>
<p class="contents">Unanimity in foreign policy is, in my view, a major disadvantage, and it really should not have been adopted. During the Iraq crisis, we saw what became of Europe if everything is to be decided unanimously. If any changes are yet to be made, therefore, then this aspect is a definite contender.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share Mr Prodi’s view that it is odd that half of the Commissioners are entitled to vote and the other half are not – this is somewhat out of order. We should, however, change as little as possible to this proposal and try to guide it through the process as well as we can. If we manage to do this during the coming six months under the Italian Presidency, then Europe will have taken another big step and we will have a bright future ahead of us with those 25 countries. You have helped to make this happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall refer to just three of the many and useful successes of the Greek Presidency that justify Mr Chirac, allowing – especially today – my national modesty to take second place to my satisfaction as a European.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Greece had the misfortune, but Europe had the fortune, that the Greek Presidency coincided with the huge moral – without doubt moral – crisis which the European Union underwent in the consciousness of the European citizens with the stance taken by certain of its members on the illegal war against Iraq. This sort of incident could have resulted in the break up of the European Union. The Greek Presidency managed not only to prevent it from breaking up, but also to express the European Union with a word of consent, which will certainly withstand the criticism of tomorrow's historians. Of course, in the future we shall have work to do to restore the moral credibility of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major historic event during the Greek Presidency was the positive decision on the Constitutional Treaty submitted to the European Council in Halkidiki by the Convention through its chairman. The text submitted takes historic steps, it interconnects the European institutions more firmly, it safeguards more than ever before the social state, crowned with the concept of full employment, for which Georgos Katiforis deserves particular thanks. However, it also has serious shortcomings, some of which have already been pointed out by previous speakers. The European Parliament, in the report which I have the honour of having undertaken together with President Gil Robles, will expose these weaknesses in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency respected the institution of the Convention and its results and thus politically – and this is important – the institution of the Convention was established as one of the major accomplishments of European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would refer to the likewise historic fact that, after seven years of being unable to take a decision, common positions were found with the European Parliament so that the regulation on the operation and funding of political parties could finally enter into force. This is extremely important in consolidating the European democratic institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After this presidency we will clearly have to explain to the public what additional benefit Europe is supposed to derive from the creation of a new post such as that of Council President, a president appointed from the ranks of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the Convention, which has already been mentioned here several times, has resulted in a compromise and the Intergovernmental Conference, too, will ultimately result in a compromise. Nevertheless, the Convention's weak points should not be overlooked, even if the worst has been avoided. There is however still the issue – which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, mentioned – of the dual presidency of the European Union. Even if the Council President has no legislative competence, that person will still represent the European Union to the outside world and it will be their personality that will determine what they make of the office. This may give rise to conflicts within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">On the arduous path to a Common Foreign and Security Policy, a post of common foreign minister has now also been created, which is supposed to combine the two functions carried out by the previous agents. This undoubtedly constitutes progress, but creating a post does not yet mean that a common policy has been created. The foreign minister – who is yet to be appointed – will embody the schizophrenia of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, subdividing the Commissioners into those with voting rights and those without is a real structural defect, particularly where the Commission remains a collective body. I can certainly understand that, when faced with an EU of 25 or more Member States, some may long for the times when there was a Community of six. But artificially scaling down the European Union by dividing it into a core Europe and the rest undermines the European Union's cohesion and also public trust in the European institutions. This weakness should therefore be remedied.</p>

It also seems to me, in any case, that Greece is a large European country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I welcome the decision taken at Thessaloniki on the five Balkan States. I believe that this was a most historic day in the creation of this greater Europe, the source of democracy, peace and stability, towards which we are all working.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Convention, I should like, Mr President, to say two things to you. The first is that it seems to me that there is an unidentified objective in this draft constitution, and that is the fourth part. You are giving us a mandate to make technical improvements to the third part, and you can count on us to do that. As for the fourth part, though, where has it disappeared to? The Convention has not really discussed it, and I am afraid that there is a broad consensus within the IGC that nothing should be said about it. In the final analysis, it seems that there is a conspiracy of silence, so as to ensure that nothing is said about what is at the heart of a constitution, namely the question of how the text can be revised and whether it authorises regional unions. When and how shall we be discussing these issues? In any case, it seems to me that, according to the Laeken mandate, these issues also fall within the competence of the Convention. I hope that, at least as far as the rest is concerned, the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to be short and decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the operating method of the Intergovernmental Conference, it seems to me that, at Thessaloniki, the rough outline was established, but there remain four absolutely vital points which the Heads of State or Government must take into account. First of all, they cannot treat this IGC just like any other IGC, like those of Amsterdam and Nice, for example. Before the new IGC takes place, things will have happened, in particular the fact that there will be twenty-five of you. Therefore the situation is not the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is that you have been asked to examine a text which has not been prepared by a group of experts or a group of wise men, but which has been drafted by 105 Members of the Convention, without any options. That is a long way from being a good basis on which to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns Parliament’s involvement. We will not accept the sort of treatment we received at Amsterdam and Nice. It was all right, but today we need something more, and something better, and, what is more, that is in the interests of the Intergovernmental Conference itself. I do not deny the intergovernmental nature of this Conference, but as regards the task to which you have committed yourselves, prepared as it has been, the Conference cannot imagine that, all of a sudden, history will come to a halt and we shall go back to the previous process, like we used to do when there was no Convention. This is why the nature of Parliament’s involvement is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last point, about the way in which the IGC will be working. I am sure, Mr President, that I will have your agreement on this point. Lack of transparency, silence and the strategy of evasion cannot be the way in which the IGC operates. In order to work and to make progress in the right direction, you need the support of Parliament, and you will need a debate, of which there will be an official record, not just the evasive statements organised by journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr President, I would ask you when and how all these elements will be explained in detail, because they are elements which are vital to the working method of the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, I too should like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council. Much has been achieved in many areas, but the Presidency of the Council will, of course, be best remembered for the kick-off of the final decision on the constitutional treaty. I hope that this will result in an Intergovernmental Conference that will decide to sign a treaty that is actually based on the Convention’s conclusions. Not only was the method of the Convention a sound choice, the leading triumvirate was one too, and it is fortunate that the Convention’s ordinary members have also added value in a significant manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone taking part in European debates nowadays is mainly faced with criticism, and I admit that we are keen to join in. What we agree on is something that we believe to be already as good as established, something we believe to be very much a matter of course and for which we have been asking for a long time. As regards the things that we think are less successful, we hope that they can still be rectified, obviously in the direction we indicate. We should not overlook the fact that there is still to be an IGC, and that we still need to convince the public. We should therefore not be tempted only to focus on our minor or major disappointments, but rather look at the whole picture and, with a sense of balance, point at the increased opportunities for transparency and at the Union’s decisive policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too should very much like to know whether the mandate which the Convention has with regard to Part III still leaves enough room for the Convention to file down a few layers of the remaining veto rights, whether the Convention now has the authority or not to change anything to Part IV and whether the European Council actually believes itself that the Union can hold out beyond the period of the next financial perspectives to work with the current financing mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really happy today to be a Christian Democrat; not because we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary, but mainly because our ideology takes as its starting point the need to believe in people. You cannot rely on structures alone. The structures with which the Convention provides us will not, on their own, enable us to move mountains. We will therefore need to rely on responsible people, and I hope that there are many of those left in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, the high point of this Presidency was the signing of the accession treaties on 16 April. It is an historic event, meaning that our divided Europe has come to an end. The future entails not only a more peaceful Europe but also a more democratic one.</p>
<p class="contents">I must just say a few words about the Lisbon strategy. A great deal has been done during the Greek Presidency, for example on coordinating the economic and employment guidelines and the social process, something that I applaud. You also listened constructively to Parliament’s points of view on the employment guidelines. In particular, you took account of what Parliament had to say on the matters relating to equality between men and women. I also want to commend you for the pensions strategy put forward during your Presidency, which I believe strikes a sound balance between economic and social aspects. That is important now that we have to review our pensions systems throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the handling of one issue, namely sustainable development. Sustainable development is as yet still only a matter of words, and we have not done very much to give more specific content to sustainable development, for example in the form of indicators. I also regret that we did not succeed in reaching an agreement on the matter of staffing companies.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Convention, I agree with what many others have already said, namely that it has been a success, partly due to its content and partly due to the way in which the work has been done. As Mrs Berès said, this must now be followed up at the Intergovernmental Conference too, and Parliament must be involved in the ongoing handling of the issue so that the transparency that has now been achieved can be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">When, finally, it comes to asylum and refugee policy, I welcome the fact that the proposal for protection zones was removed. At the same time, I regret, however, that we have still not obtained a common asylum and refugee policy with common minimum rules. In the future, we need a common asylum and refugee policy based upon generosity and humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek Presidency has succeeded in combining the major themes, already widely addressed – such as enlargement, supporting the Convention and establishing a very balanced, wise position in foreign policy – with everyday issues which are important for the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Over these past six months, a relatively short time, we have brought a number of extremely important dossiers to a conclusion. We have made progress in financial <span class="italic">dossiers</span>, closed the energy <span class="italic">dossier</span> and implemented and extended major programmes such as Erasmus and <span class="italic">e</span>Learning: I therefore endorse your work. I can see only one flaw: the conclusion of the position on agriculture. I am fully aware of the macroeconomic situation; I am fully aware of the need for the European Union to adopt a clear foreign policy with regard to the developing countries too. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the agriculture package last week is causing me some concern, for, in actual fact, we have instigated a process of dismantling our continent’s primary sector and we have, in reality, started to destroy the one genuine policy which has allowed the European Union to claim the title of Union thus far. I hope that there will be a rethink once Cancun is over, for, otherwise, Commissioner Fischler’s position, promoted<span class="bold"> </span>by the Agriculture Council, will affect what is not just a key sector for the economy but, most importantly, a key sector for consumers. In other words, we ask farmers for investment and commitments to safeguard the quality of foodstuffs and then we dismantle the various measures protecting the sector: this is a policy which I really cannot understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, in the last few weeks we have been forced to recognise that where the war in Iraq was concerned personal vanity and national egoism proved to be stronger than the aim of a common foreign policy and that as a result we did not play a part in the 'war or peace' decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We succeed when we act as a Community; we fail when we reduce Europe to the level of an intergovernmental enterprise. Acting as a Community means not having a national veto with the system of unanimity, but having greater public participation with qualified double majorities. The internal market will become a domestic market for 25 only when they all have the euro as their currency and Parliament is given a right to codecision on tax issues that are relevant to the internal market. The EU foreign minister will be more than an important and necessary job title only if we have codecision for foreign policy. Europe is more than the sum of its parts. Europe is more than the sum of the governments. All of us are Europe! Each individual carries a degree of responsibility for the future of the whole. This way of seeing ourselves is however not yet a reality but still a dream, and that is why I propose that we do not move on to the agenda but have a more in-depth round of communication, information and social dialogue about the results of the last six months. That is also why I call for us to continue to apply the characteristics of the Convention – transparency, proximity to the people and democratisation. The Convention itself fostered this and that is why I think that a public opinion poll on the result of the Intergovernmental Conference would call for regions, nations and members of the public to be directly involved. It would give domestic policy a European dimension, it would make national movements European ones ahead of the forthcoming European elections, and it would inform the public that we are all part of Europe and successfully active in it.</p>

You mentioned it in only one sentence. I should like to say something about the Balkans and south-eastern Europe. I very much welcomed your initiative and I am also delighted that the Thessaloniki paper, that was prepared together with the Commission, has been adopted, because it contains much of what Parliament has demanded. Obviously I now hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that as an ordinary Member of the Council you will work together with the new Council Presidency to implement its content. We are still waiting for it to be implemented in the countries of the Balkans. It would be nice if the EU and the Council could actually agree to implement the decisions that they make in papers of this kind. This involves, for example, opening up education and youth programmes to the young people of these countries, which sends out an extremely important signal to them. It also involves annual reports on progress in the individual States, and the reinforcement of the twinning programme so as to modernise the administrative structures in these countries and make them ready for the accession that they have, of course, been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect there to be more cooperation in the region, particularly between Greece and Italy and these countries, on human trafficking and cross-border crime. We also hope that you will perhaps consider, together with your colleagues in the Council and the Commission, easing the visa requirements in a number of fields and for particular professions, so that people are able to gain faster entry to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that positive progress is made when we start, as we are now doing, to initiate discussions between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. I would be very pleased if you, as a country bordering the Balkans, could help to move this forward. I very much hope that the Serb, Roma and Ashkali refugees will at last be able to return to Kosovo so that the conditions can be put in place to enable them to live there side by side. I think that the Council and the Commission need to step up the pressure on the Albanians in Kosovo in this regard. We did not wage a war to have a situation today that is not wholly dissimilar to the unpleasant state of affairs that we have seen there over the last ten years. I believe that we need to be more deeply committed, because of course we want these countries to return to stability and peace. That is also the case in Serbia and I would urge you to use your influence to stop the Serbian Government continuing to gag journalists, as it is now doing. Media freedom in Serbia is under threat. Please give your word. Do not tolerate it! Otherwise, thank you very much for your commitment.</p>

<p class="contents">The United States have set out their security policy in clear terms, and it guides their actions on a day-to-day basis. A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary. The paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind. If we take a closer look at it, we see that when it comes to analysing new threats in the world, joint statements are made that are extremely detailed and also completely accurate. But when it comes to defining the answers to them and saying what now needs to be done, we see that the system of unanimity makes it extremely difficult to come up with a coherent statement.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this paper can only be a beginning, a beginning with important statements. Nevertheless, we need a broad debate about this in the European Union, including in Parliament, so as to gradually formulate a common security strategy. We need clearer statements on our relations with NATO, on our relations with the United Nations, and on the roles that Russia and also Turkey will play in this security concept, and we need a clearer mandate – this too is addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference – for the arms agency that is now being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, we need a step-by-step plan. We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines. Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your many, very many positive criticisms fill all of us who participated in the Greek Presidency with great joy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the comments expressed, I shall pick out two or three issues. The first core issue to which you referred was the issue of the new Constitutional Treaty and the Convention. Ladies and gentlemen, as President-in-Office of the European Union, I visited the 24 Member States for the first time in order to prepare the summit in Halkidiki and to help so that the Constitutional Convention could finish its work. I thought I knew Europe well. However, I found that there are significant differences, not only social and political differences, of course, which were visible and known, but also as regards the perception of the issues of the European Union, the progress of Europe and European cooperation. There were countries which have a completely different perception of the Presidency from the perception all of you have and from what is happening or has happened in past years. I do not believe that we can find a solution to European issues unless we take account of these differences and try to find compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States in central Europe are living with the past, a past of repression by the Soviet Union. They are living with the fear of similar developments, they want to pay great attention to relations between the European Union and Russia, they set particular store by security issues, cooperation and participation in ΝΑΤΟ. We also know that the old countries in the European Union now have a different perspective, because they have seen that the European Union has overcome these problems. Therefore, compromises are needed on all issues. And a number of steps – either big or small – need to be taken. Besides, we cannot achieve the objectives we would like right from the start, the objectives, for example, of a Union which operates to a federal standard, with advanced central policies, a Union which has a uniform foreign policy without difficulties on all the issues etc.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these conclusions, I want to repeat that the compromise contained in the Convention's text is a good compromise. A good compromise, a good basis for further discussions, which will take place at the Intergovernmental Conference. The issues of the Intergovernmental Conference will be resolved by the Italian Presidency, which will convene it, as agreed in Halkidiki, during October. That is also where the answers will be given about the participation of the European Parliament and the working method.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the question of what the technical issues mean in relation to the third chapter of the Constitutional Treaty. As we remember, the European Council decided that the work of the Convention should be completed by June and it insisted on this, as did the summit in March and the extraordinary informal summit held in Athens for that reason. We therefore said in Halkidiki that, as there is this decision, the Convention should not continue its work by changing this text or this compromise which was presented. Mr Giscard d'Estaing said that the third chapter needs to be brought into line with the two previous chapters, that the method of expression or form of the third chapter are a method of expression and a form that need correction, which is why it was decided to extend the Convention, so that the work could continue within the framework of what had been agreed, on the basis of what had been agreed, and the third chapter could be brought into line with the previous chapters. Having said which, the Convention will, of course, have to decide what this harmonisation work will be, but the Council was clear that it does not want to reverse this arrangement or the compromise reached. So I think that good work was done and the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to finish according to the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the second issue raised, the issue of immigration. There is misinformation here. I was asked whether or not the single border guard had been decided or discussed. Of course it was discussed. The three Scandinavian countries and numerous countries of central Europe stated that, for constitutional reasons, they would not agree under any circumstances to this sort of guard and that this sort of guard is not possible. Consequently, because the objective is not for there to be a guard, but for there to be common action and coordination, we emphasised in particular in the decision taken in Halkidiki the need for common action and coordination, and various proposals are contained in the Commission text, which is also the basis for the decision on how this coordination will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the distribution of the burden between the Member States is concerned, it exists. However, there is an erroneous perception, that decisions will be taken so that, for example, Germany will give Italy money to deal with immigration. That is not what it is about. It was decided that there would be common programmes, of the Union as a whole which, because they were applied in the Mediterranean, for example, or on the Union's eastern borders, would benefit a number of countries. This is the distribution of burdens. The common programmes help those countries or the areas in which there is a problem, or those countries which have some special need to address the overall problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as far as readmission agreements are concerned, I would like to point out, because it was said that Turkey has a readmission agreement with the Union, that it has no readmission agreement with the Union, which is why we said that the Union needs to conclude readmission agreements. We therefore decided that there should be a series of criteria for the application of these agreements, because a country cannot cooperate with the Union and refuse to accept the return of immigrants. I agree with all those who pointed out that this policy must also continue under the Italian Presidency, because we have taken a step, I believe an important step, but more needs to be done both on asylum and on immigration to complete that step.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue which I wish to mention concerns the issue relating to Mr Solana's proposal. Mr Wurtz commented that this proposal by Mr Solana needs to be debated and we agree entirely. Mr Solana has undertaken to process his proposal by December and, of course, afterwards, as with Economic and Monetary Union, so too with security policy, whatever form it takes, and defence policy, we need a broad debate here in Parliament and in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Solana's proposal has much to commend it. It does not generalise, it concerns specific issues and correctly identifies the dangers. And these dangers arise from weapons of mass destruction, because modern technology allows weapons of mass destruction to be manufactured without the technical means needed in the past. Therefore, such weapons can also be made in other countries and prevention is needed. Prevention does not necessarily mean that the means for military intervention must exist. Prevention for immigration was also what was said, financing for other countries. Prevention of terrorism is monitoring these developments, controlling trade, signing agreements governing the provision of information. We need prevention. We need a policy for this, so that we can stay ahead of such situations. Mr Solana has made a proposal, a step, and I believe that we need to continue it, because Greece is convinced from the visits it made, that we need a common defence and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Papayannakis said that there is continuity on major problems. Of course there is continuity and it has never been maintained that the Greek Presidency resolved all the Union's problems. That would be ridiculous. In the Balkans, for example, to which one honourable Member referred, both the next Presidency and Greece, now in the capacity of<span class="italic"> </span>a Member State of the European Union, will need to follow up the solutions found. But, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, if there is to be a follow-up, we need to talk creatively. And I think that the Greek Presidency, as you have confirmed in your comments, gave a creative direction to the approach to the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, what did we want to do? I should like to close by repeating our aspiration. We wanted to create a stronger Europe and we followed up the Lisbon policies so that there would, for example, be a stronger Europe in the social and economic sector. We wanted the cohesion of Europe, hence our policy on Iraq. We wanted prospects for Europe, which is why we worked for the Constitution and the security policy. We wanted to make Europe a world power, hence our policy for the Middle East, our policy with Russia, the USA, Japan and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we progressed and we progressed thanks to cooperation with you. We progressed thanks to the great help of the European Commission, which submitted a series of proposals, thanks to the contribution made by Mr Prodi, and we also progressed, I believe, because something particularly positive happened during these six months: all the European countries realised that we need to progress. We need to create. We cannot stay put. As long as we stay put, there is an increasing risk of our losing what we already have. In order to keep it and to gain even more, we need to progress.</p>

There are two points on which I would like to focus, however, for I feel that they are particularly important and supplement the Members’ speeches and Prime Minister Simitis’ response.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns immigration. I have noted that this subject has attracted the attention of a large number of Members of Parliament and I am therefore anxious to stress the long-term principles which the Commission intends to apply in this sensitive, key area. Firstly, close, ongoing cooperation with third countries. We cannot solve the problem of illegal immigration just by clamping down at this end: that is a sure, confirmed fact and it is the basis of our initiative, but our partners will have to cooperate responsibly in this initiative of ours. Secondly, solidarity between Member States. This is a problematic point because of the different perceptions, the different attitudes – which the Greek Prime Minister has already highlighted – but we must remember that, after Schengen, the issue of immigration became a European issue, which must be resolved, which can only be resolved in a European context. We are an economic area: we have to learn to become an area of freedom and security too – there is no alternative. Thirdly, we need to facilitate and simplify legal immigration. Europe must continue to be a land which welcomes the stranger, but with strict regard for the law. There can be no tolerance of modern-day slave traders. Lastly, we must not confuse rigour with inhumanity. There must be no deviation from the pursuit of our values of equilibrium and respect: it is a question of civilisation and of European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is equally brief. Mr Wurtz raised the issue – most appropriately, it would appear, seeing as it was picked up on in other speeches – of relations with the United States, foreign policy and Europe’s role on the world stage. I would like to make just one point in this regard. The bilateral meeting with the United States, with President Bush, was extremely interesting and extremely friendly, and both parties outlined their positions clearly. I was struck by one aspect, namely that where Europe is able to act in a united fashion – as Mrs Maij-Weggen said in her speech – the United States is ready to listen to us and to follow us. I can bear witness to the way Mr Bush was impressed by our account of the economic dimension of the Union, of the number of citizens there will be following enlargement, of the nature of enlargement itself, of the way we have conducted the negotiation process with due regard for democracy – the way we have discussed with each individual country, with all the parliaments, chapter by chapter, the components, the statutes of our democracy, in order to create a genuinely shared democratic vision. This has been and continues to be a European vision that nobody can take away from us. This is progress. It is a way of extending democracy that we can pursue in the world. In this regard, we are listened to with great respect, for nobody has ever carried out an experiment of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing which has made a lasting impression on President Bush is the role of the euro. So many of the issues and questions which we are addressing today derive precisely from the fact that we are starting to see the results, the effects of the euro. We expected this but many sceptics did not believe it would happen: the truth is plain to see. When, as in the discussion with the United States, I point out that well over half of transactions with Russia and other countries are now carried out in euros – for the euro is a driving force, it can only go on to be used in sectors currently outside its scope such as energy or other sectors because we are being carried that way by the momentum – then Europe is heeded, then Europe is a genuine political entity and not only an economic entity, even though we are talking about purely economic matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we were heeded when we outlined the future strategy for the Balkans, to resolve once and for all an issue to the solution of which the United States has contributed greatly, although it stopped when it reached a certain point because it could go no further. At that point, Europe has put forward the definitive solution: it has provided the political solution, the solution which brings to a close one of the most serious issues of contemporary history.</p>
<p class="contents">At these times Europe is strong, when it succeeds in making its voice heard, in matters on which we stand united. That is why the Convention must take these facts into consideration, promoting majority decision-making in order to give Europe the ability always to speak with one voice. It is important that it has become clear and is being accepted – albeit in a light-hearted manner, with a half-smile – that neither the wisdom of Old Europe nor the youthful ardour of the United States is alone sufficient to save world peace: both are necessary. That is why, as I see it, the guarantee of peace lies precisely in a strong, close relationship with the United States. However, this relationship can only be maintained through dignity and strength, and we have dignity and strength only in those areas where there is no right of veto, in those areas in which we can establish our will, as happens in all other democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are: these are the comments I wanted to make. I would like to end by thanking Mr Simitis once again. Sophocles’ <span class="italic">Antigone</span> contains the sentence, ‘<span class="italic">Αρχή άνδρα δείκνυσι</span>’. I do not know if my – now hazy – memory of Greek has reproduced it accurately, but it means something very precise: that the exercise of power puts a man’s nature to the test. Mr President-in-Office – Prime Minister – your nature has passed that test with flying colours.</p>

The most notable of these relate to the Convention and the so-called European constitution, to confirmation of the immigration decisions taken at Seville, which aim to create a ‘fortress Europe’, and to the maintenance of the monetarist policies of the Stability Pact and of neoliberal objectives for reforming the labour markets and social and health services, as well as for privatising most public services.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that the aforesaid European Constitution can serve as a basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for October. This conference represents a fresh qualitative leap forward in the process of integration, consolidating the fundamental bases and strands set out in the Treaty of Maastricht. These aspects were developed later at Amsterdam, but above all at Nice, whose treaty came into force a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for altering the European Union’s institutional model are completely unacceptable, since they strengthen the federalist nature of its institutions and its domination by the major powers. I am thinking especially of proposals to end the rotating presidency of the European Council, to elect a president according to rules which give preeminence to the larger countries, to end the practice of each country having a Commissioner, and to extend qualified majority voting at the expense of the right of veto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
