<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission attaches high priority to the fight against fraudulent misuse of the financial resources of the European Union. The Commission is well aware of the fact that the European Parliament is our staunchest ally in this cause. Today the college of Commissioners has unanimously approved the Green Book I presented on the use of criminal law to protect the financial interests of the Community and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor. By adopting this Green Paper just before the European Council meeting in Laeken, the Commission has sent out a strong political signal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already made some headway in the fight against fraud. This applies especially to our cooperation with the Member States. The Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is doing sterling work in this domain. The Commission has also been doing a great deal in the field of prevention; for example, OLAF will examine all future legislative proposals to ascertain whether they are fully fraud-resistant. On the other hand, there are still many serious shortcomings to be rectified in the body of criminal law with which the European Union seeks to combat fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a consistent approach to criminal prosecution throughout Europe. The prosecution of cross-border frauds involving funds from the Community budget all too frequently grinds to a halt at the borders between different legal systems, of which there are not only 15 but 17 in the European Union, a number that will increase still further with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">What is lacking is an effective instrument with which administrative scrutiny by OLAF and national investigations can be made to culminate in criminal prosecution rather than running into the brick walls that divide our legal systems. For this reason, back in September 2000, the Commission tabled a proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice that a European Public Prosecutor be established to protect the financial interests of the Communities through the system of criminal law. The introduction of a European fiscal prosecutor would be unprecedented in qualitative terms, and a truly innovative step in the judicial fight against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government, sadly, did not pursue this proposal at the time. The issue, however, is far too important to be left on the shelf to gather dust. For this reason, I immediately decided to draw up a Green Paper which would spell out the details of the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor as well as indicating how this Public Prosecutor could operate in practice. The best possible use should therefore be made of the time between now and the next reform of the Treaties to respond to the questions and scepticism from the Member States, which have been asking us repeatedly about the precise form that such a system would take.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Treaty would merely deal with the appointment, the dismissal and the responsibilities of the European Public Prosecutor and the main elements of his or her job specification. All other details, such as the status and working methods of the Public Prosecutor, would be laid down in secondary legislation. These are precisely the questions that are now addressed in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">How and on whose initiative does the Public Prosecutor act? What are his or her powers? Who supervises the actions of the Public Prosecutor? How does he or she cooperate with the national prosecuting agencies? What is the Prosecutor’s legal status, and how is the Office of the European Public Prosecutor to be organised?</p>
<p class="contents">On these questions, the Green Paper advances various options for discussion. The Commission, however, also clearly expresses its preferences, which, taken together, form a coherent system. What is the general approach that the Commission is proposing? Which principles underlie the Green Paper? The general approach proposed by the Commission is that the European Union should legislate only where such legislation is absolutely necessary and should rely as far as possible on the national laws and legal systems to regulate other matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals are therefore fully consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The European Public Prosecutor would considerably enhance the effectiveness of criminal law as an instrument in the fight against fraud without turning the national judicial systems upside down. What does that mean in detail?</p>
<p class="contents">The originality of the proposal lies in the fact that the European Public Prosecutor would be a central authority responsible for conducting and co-ordinating criminal investigations and prosecutions at the European level, whereas the Office of the European Public Prosecutor itself would not be centralised, and the principle of mutual recognition would be paramount when it came to taking specific measures. A common investigation and prosecution area would thus be created in Europe for the protection of the Communities’ financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Once investigations were completed, the European Public Prosecutor would prefer charges before the proper national court in the relevant Member State. The proceedings themselves, including the delivery of a judgment, would then be governed by national law. The Commission proposes a decentralised structure for the Office of the European Public Prosecutor. In the Member States, the European Public Prosecutor would be assisted by ‘delegated national prosecutors’ whose responsibilities would have a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">As for proceedings, the European Public Prosecutor should be able to draw on the broad range of national investigation instruments. European prosecutors should therefore be able to enlist the help of the national and regional prosecuting authorities, such as the criminal investigation departments of the national police forces. The application of the principle of mutual recognition should also ensure that these investigative measures are automatically admissible throughout the territory of the Community. The same applies to the recognition of evidence and to judicial scrutiny of the actions of the European Public Prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, if an application made in a Member State for a search or telephone-surveillance warrant is granted by a national court under the applicable national law, the warrant would be valid throughout the territory of the Community. This approach respects the national legal system. At the same time, the principle of mutual recognition would ensure that the common investigation area became a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as judicial scrutiny of the European Public Prosecutor’s actions is concerned, the Commission also takes the view that national legal channels are adequate for this purpose and sees no compelling need for a European criminal court. Moreover, the Commission does not believe that the definition of the crimes for which the European Public Prosecutor could prefer charges implies the need to create an autonomous European penal code. What we do propose is the minimum essential degree of harmonisation, which should certainly go beyond the level that is set in the proposed directive for the protection of the Community’s financial interests and should therefore cover a wider catalogue of crimes than is covered by the 1995 Convention. We want to incorporate all offences that damage the financial interests of the Community, such as fraudulent practices in connection with tendering procedures or breaches of official secrecy to the detriment of Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider uniform rules necessary for sentencing and prescription limits. The Green Paper, then, is structured in strict accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality while guaranteeing that a European Public Prosecutor will be able to operate efficiently and effectively. It is my view that we have struck a good balance which might even win over some sceptics.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of a European Public Prosecutor fits neatly into the vision of a common European legal area. I compiled the Green Paper in close cooperation with Commissioner Vitorino. The various departments of OLAF were also in constant touch with their counterparts in the Directorate-General headed by Mr Vitorino during the drafting process. The new and long-awaited breakthroughs that have been made in judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters represent a sound basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor. One of these is the European arrest warrant, which we hope the European Council will approve in Laeken. Another is Eurojust. The Eurojust initiative is not in competition with the European Public Prosecutor either. The two, in fact, would complement each other very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Green Paper to herald the start of a broad and objective discussion about the creation of a European Public Prosecutor with all interested parties, including, of course, practitioners, judges and prosecutors in the Member States. I would ask the European Parliament, as the driving force behind this idea, to play an active part in this discussion and to foster the debate in the Member States. We need the widest possible feedback on our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Once we have analysed the results of the consultation process, our aim is to be able to contribute something at the end of 2002 or the beginning of 2003 to the convention responsible for preparing the next intergovernmental conference. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the European Public Prosecutor is enshrined in the Treaties when they are next revised. We must be prepared for a long haul. I am, however, optimistic, because this goal can be achieved together, with the support of the European Parliament.</p>

A fortnight ago, you described me as a champion of the European State Financial Prosecutor. I take that as a title of honour and might perhaps apply the term to you yourself, as we have now of course achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the nineties – a Green Paper and consequent Treaty amendment. I believe, though, that the timetable has to be tightened up a bit, as what you have said indicates that such a State Prosecutor will be in place only in 2006 or 2007. So, we are on your side, but, as we want to speed the process up, I would like to ask you to find the time to enable us to achieve the objective, and, with all the subsidiarity, please see to it that the process is not ponderous, slow or inefficient. That is important; it will enable us to really move ahead with setting up the State Prosecutor. The citizens out there demand it, and we are doing something for Europe if we make it clear that it is Europe's money that we are protecting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it is a fact that you, Mrs Theato, were the originator of this idea and have been pursuing it for a long time. I believe that we are now at a stage when, as the Nice Summit showed, it really is important to be precise. The question at issue was what exactly this meant, which is often taken as an excuse to say that the whole idea will have to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable looks more or less like this: the consultation will run until June 2002. While a new treaty amendment is launched for the next Intergovernmental Conference, proposals for secondary legislation – that is, on functioning and on such issues as the admissibility of evidence – will be drafted at the same time. The time available will be used for both purposes, so that we can as soon as possible not only give form to the idea, but also make the institution a practical reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only two weeks ago in Parliament we saw huge tranches of her own report being deleted because they contained references to such a body.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be some dissension among the various political parties in this House but many people are concerned about what this is actually leading to. I do not think you were being completely fair with us, Commissioner, when you said it will only go so far and no further. Will it lead to <span class="italic">corpus juris</span>? If you say no to this question, how can you reconcile that with the answer that Mrs Delmas-Marty gave our committee a month ago? Mrs Delmas-Marty is the former head of the supervisory body of OLAF and she has written many books on this particular subject. She said yes – a European public prosecutor will almost certainly lead to <span class="italic">corpus juris</span>, a common body of law throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">What would be the core competences of the European public prosecutor? What powers would he or she have? What are the Community's financial interests? Surely you are not ignoring political signals sent by both the Council – many countries are against this – and Parliament, which, as I said at the beginning, two weeks ago rejected many things to do with the European public prosecutor? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That agreement, though, is not yet in force, and the Commission therefore proposed to include it in a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commission, Parliament was of the opinion that the directive was not the right place for a definition of a Public Prosecutor, both of them being convinced that the creation of a European Public Prosecutor could not be accomplished by a directive, but would need an amendment to the Treaties. It was for that reason that Parliament struck out a Member's proposal that it should be dealt with in the directive, but doing so was not a vote against the European Public Prosecutor. This, I think, is something we must stick to.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to ask now what the duties of the European Public Prosecutor might be. One is that he will take over the direction and coordination of law enforcement and also direct investigations, which would themselves be conducted according to national law. The European Public Prosecutor would then be entitled, having assembled incriminatory and exculpatory evidence, to bring charges on the basis of that evidence, and this would also be done in accordance with national law and in a national court, so there is no question of creating some huge new apparatus or a new European penal code – we all know how much scepticism there still is about that. Many of these cases are listed in our Green Paper. There was, for example, the regulation that, where evidence was gathered in one Member State and then, crime knowing no frontiers, was used in a cross-frontier case before another court, it could be objected to on the grounds that it had been gathered in accordance with administrative law. That is something we do not recognise. It often happens that there is a mass of evidence of fraud being committed against the European budget, but the evidence is, as it were – legally rather than bureaucratically – defined out of existence, because of the sort of differences that there are. I do not believe that is in the public interest, and it is certainly not in the interests of Parliament. I would ask you, Mr Heaton-Harris, to examine this proposal with an unprejudiced mind. We have said that we are committed to applying the subsidiarity principle, but we do of course want there to be real protection in criminal law for Community interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed a correct account.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to echo the words of Mrs Theato and call for speed. Commissioner, you have now announced a timeframe for setting up the post of European Public Prosecutor that is indeed a very slow process. You will be submitting a proposal after the Green Paper consultation in the course of 2002 or at the end of 2002 or beginning of 2003, this will be followed by a Treaty amendment in 2004, and entry into force is likely in 2006-2007. You will have to admit that this is all a long way off. I should like to note that at the time, the Committee of Independent Experts made a few suggestions in reaction to the dismissal of the Santer Commission in order to work faster and to move away from multi-stage plans. I should like to ask you whether you have adopted elements of these proposals by the experts in the Green Paper and whether you are willing to consider them, thus enabling us to make a start on the establishment of the function of European Public Prosecutor at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council decided otherwise, and this proposal was not even put on the table for the negotiations. Now we must in fact wait for the next IGC to carry out an amendment of the Treaty that will make the creation of the European Public Prosecutor possible, but, as I was saying, we will be making good use of this time and not just waiting; we will be using the time for consultation to find out the best possible model, and will then be discussing functioning, organisation, status, evidence gained from questioning, periods of limitation, in short, all the things that of course have to be cleared up.

I do not think, Commissioner, that you can in fact afford to wait until 2006. You cannot do so in view of the revelation of two billion euros' worth of fraud and irregularities, and in view of the challenges, some of them financial, with which eastward enlargement is going to face both you and us. I do think that speed really is of the essence here, and, indeed, you must not wait. You know that as well as we do, you know our report and you know about the proposals that have been made, which have stated that you are well able to tackle an initial, introductory stage without amending the Treaty establishing the European Community. Both the Council of Experts, which made proposals in 1999 towards reform of the Commission, and also the latest annual report of the committee overseeing OLAF have mapped out these two stages for you. In view of this pressure, which really is needed, I ask you: why do you still hesitate? Why are you again putting it off, until 2006? Why are you so hesitant, why do you not take the plunge, as we urged, most recently in the Bösch report? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not the case; rather, the European Union is founded on the Member States' agreement to cede competences to the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have not as yet ceded the competence to establish a European Public Prosecutor. The foundation for such a law enforcement competence must first be laid at the European level, in other words, a Treaty amendment is needed to do it, and an effective instrument needs to be created, one that can actually deal with cross-frontier crime in all the Member States efficiently, not only carrying out investigations, but also bringing charges that result in prosecution and, finally, punishment. It is that procedure that we must apply. You may well now say that you wish the European Union were different, but I must tell you that the Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and what we propose must therefore take due account of the competences. This proposal really does, in my view, promise much for the future, and I hope that we can use it to convince even the sceptics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder if you could comment on that.</p>

<p class="contents">Thirdly, how will the European Public Prosecutor be appointed?

The European Public Prosecutor proposed here has to do with the protection of Community interests in the financial sphere, whereas Eurojust deals with other types of serious crime. Of course there has to be a link here, for data exchange among other things, but always from the data protection angle. We must look at it in a complementary way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Public Prosecutor's appointment would involve various procedures. On the one hand, a procedure must be devised for the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor, who would, as it were, represent all public prosecutors. The national European Public Prosecutors or the Delegates want a decentralised structure and would then be appointed under the relevant law of the Member State. I do not believe that Mr Heaton-Harris wants to protect fraudsters; rather, this is about what steps have to be taken for protection to be efficient. I will say again that we have a Community Budget, we have Community finances and we have a common internal market, and to that degree we no longer have borders in the legal sphere, but we do still have seventeen different legal systems, as the United Kingdom has three different legal systems. These, then, are real obstacles, which leads to the possibility of real defects in law enforcement, defects that we should overcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is that OLAF would continue in its present function of carrying out investigations under administrative law, in which case provision would of course have to be made for OLAF to present its results to the same Public Prosecutor, who would make use of the intelligence thus gathered. Another possibility would be for OLAF to itself take over enquiries rather than being limited to an examining role. We consciously refrained from giving that a prominent position in the current debate, but then it would have been said afterwards that we wanted to give OLAF a specific role. This is, as it were, an issue that has to be worked out once we have the ‘big picture’. I can only reiterate that we are not now dealing with competing conceptions, but with a White Paper in the drafting of which OLAF played a part. OLAF is always facing the difficulty of its having gathered evidence or intelligence and then having to wait to see whether a national state prosecutor's office will accept this material and work with it. If we had a European Financial Public Prosecutor, it would be a really positive step forward for OLAF's work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
