<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wieland (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow members, this report deals with a very complex issue. One of the proposed amendments relates to considerations which, basically, deal prosaically with a matter of general concern to the House – if the large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is anything to go by –, namely the fact that the public seeking legal advice in the European Union is still not being provided with comprehensive legal texts as and when they are needed; and not just the public seeking legal advice, the specialist public or trained legal practitioners.</p>
<p class="contents">One proposed amendment therefore calls in particular for the Commission to promptly provide suitably worded texts reflecting the latest developments in the legal world. What we are talking about here is, as it were, a <span class="italic">ceterum censeo</span>, which needs to be the subject of debate here in the House for all directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is an issue which needs to be taken out of brackets, as it were. A derogation for Italian pharmacists has been extended although, contrary to the common position, the Committee on Legal Affairs proposes that a cut-off date be attached to the derogation. Anyone who began studying before October 1990 will be protected under this directive but must expect to complete their studies within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these general rules, we have also proposed amendments to the directives which apply to doctors. Doctors are a sensitive issue, human health is a very sensitive issue. If I have a car accident, I can quantify and repair the damage. I know of no-one from my law practice who, having received compensation for physical injury, would not gladly give the money back in return for restored health, which is why this issue requires special attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs therefore sets great store by the following conclusion: first, that specialists should also keep up with general practice while training as specialists. Differential diagnostics continue to change, which is why specialist training must also include general practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we are calling, by a large majority, for specialist training to be increased from at least two to at least three years in order to take account of a broad trend within the European Union. It is time for improvements here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the Committee on Legal Affairs is calling for greater focus on continuing training. We know and admit that this subject was not quite so urgent at first reading but there are now problems here for procedural reasons. An exception is made when Parliament is re-elected between the first and second readings. That applies here, which is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has introduced the concept of continuing training as one of the mainstays of this House and as one of the mainstays of the European Union. We believe that lifelong learning is not just the stuff of soap-box speeches; it should be standard and patients should be able to expect their doctors to complete further training, which is why Amendments Nos 1 to 11 are broadly supported by the committee and will surely be broadly supported by the House tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address one more point. Two other amendments have been proposed concerning Irish architects. The PPE-DE group – my group – intends to withdraw its amendment here. I would recommend that the House also reject the amendment along these lines proposed by the UEN. This is a national problem and must be solved at national level; it cannot, in any case, be solved at European level. If we introduce regulations here then others who are even less entitled to do so will surely table similar requests.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – The single market is one of the great achievements of the European Community. To have turned the distinct and fragmented markets of the Member States into a single European market is an extraordinary and revolutionary change. While it is true that the process has not yet been completed, it has been set on an irrevocable course. The mechanics needed to achieve this change are very extensive, as can be seen from even the most cursory examination of Lord Cockfield's 1992 programme, one of the most revolutionary, yet on the face of it unexciting programmes of the post-war world.</p>
<p class="contents">Within that framework there is clearly a choice of instruments for putting the single market in place which can be described as the choice between harmonization and mutual recognition. Of these, harmonization is more seductive for the gung-ho politician who wants to be seen doing something, one of the scourges of the contemporary world. In my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive. They are after all more subtle and sophisticated.</p>
<p class="contents">The insensitive imposition of harmonization has caused untold political damage to the European political enterprise and had the single market been based more on mutual recognition and less on harmonization Europe's political condition would be much less febrile than it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the great difficulties in establishing a network of mutual recognition is the complexity of the procedures required to put it into place and to ensure the ongoing compatibility and appropriateness of the mutual recognition network.</p>
<p class="contents">This requires ongoing monitoring and we very much welcome the revision of the series of directives which are the subject of this debate this evening. As the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, has pointed out in his excellent report, this directive is primarily about procedures as they relate to the recognition of diplomas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if I might conclude on a parochial note, as a United Kingdom MEP, we especially welcome the extension of the minimum length for specific training in general medical practice for doctors from two to three years. Secondly, we welcome the stipulation that Member States are to examine the qualifications already recognised in one Member State which have been obtained in a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and more generally, I would like to reiterate the rapporteur's general conclusion that this is all far too difficult and complicated for anyone other than an expert or a lawyer and every effort must be made to simplify the law and make it more user-friendly so that the single market is understood by all our citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes, most importantly, ensuring that young people can develop their skills and talent in any place of their choice in any country in the Union, irrespective of where they are from and where they trained. Anyone who has learned something at one end of the Union should be able to pursue his or her career in a country in the middle or at the other end of the Union. The European Parliament takes this aspect of the future of young people very seriously, which is why we keep pressing to have equivalent qualifications recognised in all Member States. We want to ensure that there are no bureaucratic hurdles to hamper citizens' rights of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment. But we also want to guarantee high training standards; high standards guarantee progress and are in the interests of all our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has had no trouble highlighting a few important points in the directive before us today. I hope that plenary shares its views and will vote in favour by a large majority. The Group of the Party of European Socialists will, in all events, be voting in favour of all, I repeat all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is most important both to me personally and to my group that the need for lifelong learning has been highlighted, thereby ensuring that doctors, who are the focus of this directive, have a high standard of future-orientated professional qualifications. The need for professional qualifications acquired in individual Member States to be seen as equivalent also cut clear across the political divide. That is as important for patients and, in the final analysis, for all citizens, as it is for the medical profession itself. For this reason alone, it is important for the Council to follow the European Parliament's lead and not to take refuge in the conciliation procedure, which may allow it to gain time, but not recognition. Thank you for listening.</p>

These are important points although they are not controversial among us.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome in particular the extension of training for general practitioners to three years, together with the amendment originally moved by Mrs Gebhardt for lifelong learning for general practitioners. This is extremely important. The medical associations have been pressing us upon this point and I fully agree with them. It is also important as a purely linguistic matter to make sure that <span class="italic">gleichwertig </span>is translated as "equivalent" and its equivalent words in other European languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by taking up the point that nothing is more important than that the laws of the European Union should be understandable to its citizens. Without that our Community and our Union lack the clarity of purpose which will make them not merely acceptable to, but embraced by, the citizens. Therefore all projects of consolidation of law that tend to making the law more readily understood by the citizen and its purposes more lucid to her or him are projects to which we should give our greatest support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to support this report. I once again congratulate my friend, Mr Wieland, on the spirit in which he moved it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is clearly a somewhat difficult undertaking for, apart from anything else, there are 14 directives in existence on the subject and each one has been amended several times. Moreover, the failures and delays of the Member States in complying with European legislation have all too often been justified by its complexity or by the difficulty of gaining access to information at European level. As the rapporteur points out, even lawyers have trouble. However, at the end of the day, the only people to pay the price for this situation are the citizens, especially young people who may well have invested time and energy in the certainty of obtaining results and official recognition and feel betrayed by the institutions. And the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The complexity which exists in Europe in relation to the recognition of qualifications gives rise to documents such as this, which, despite the efforts of Parliament and the Commission itself, is a real ‘collage’. This document is a ‘collage’ in the sense that, although it tries to remedy situations which are unjust, those people with most power, such as the doctors’ ‘lobby’, which has been very active, have managed to resolve their situation. Many other people, however, have travelled, have acquired academic qualifications, have trained professionally and have still not had their qualifications recognised and therefore have no rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, and in this respect I am sorry to disagree with Mr Wieland, despite the fact that he has done such good work, that this is a very simple problem when looked at from the point of view of Roman law and its notion of the right of individuals. All individuals have the right for their studies to be recognised. These days we are always talking about mobility. We give grants so that people may have mobility, but then we do not recognise what has been studied with those grants. We talk of the Europe of research and a Europe of knowledge and then we do not recognise, out of pure fear or pure vested interests, anything that people do outside of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I wish now to ask that we question this directive, so that the recognition of the medical qualifications may be extended to many other qualifications, because it seems to me to be truly unjust that this is not the case, and that a country is unable to pass on what it knows to another country.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is that a lot of knowledge is confined to certain areas, in certain universities and in certain companies. If recognition were to be extended, Europe could enjoy the full right to the transfer of knowledge and that would be a real innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as representative of the Culture Committee in this case, I ask that this recognition be extended and that the road be opened to greater recognition of equivalence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every member who, like me, lives in a border region, knows the problems encountered by citizens who work or wish to establish in a nearby Member State. The EU Treaty clearly regulates the freedom of movement and the freedom to establish of people in the EU. But the devil is in the detail. We now realise that in fact every job description needs to be regulated. But people no longer understand this. Is this a citizens' Europe? Is this a common market? These are the questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties are clear from the number of current directives alone – there are "only" fourteen on today's subject. We must reduce and harmonise the huge administrative costs, including within the Member States, which is why the Commission proposal to simplify the procedure is most welcome. Individual job descriptions, training courses and pre-requisites vary enormously within the EU. We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula. In the long run, uniform training courses and uniform curricula would be a great help and we must work towards that.</p>
<p class="contents">Until then, the Member States must consider very carefully how and where additional demands and improvements are needed and what sort of subsequent examination then needs to be demanded. The deadline provided for by the Commission – which says that a decision on recognition must be made within three months – is an excellent move. Procedures for recognising diplomas acquired in third countries must also be simplified. We must cut the red tape within the EU, so that our citizens are able to put their skills to good use in every Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Weiland, and point out that I agree with what Evelyne Gebhardt said before me.</p>
<p class="contents">As an MEP from a border region I am frequently questioned by students that have come up against a system that was implemented in 1989 and 1992, and I am not exaggerating when I say that urgent changes are needed as current mechanisms are far from transparent. Too many students come up against brick walls in their attempt to have their qualifications validated by the authorities in the various Member States. All too often they are unjustly denied recognition, which places them in an intolerable position. As far as principles are concerned, this is a violation of the right to the freedom of movement and, from a more human point of view, it creates an often devastating situation for students who have sought to better their qualifications but then cannot find a relevant job at the end of it. The cost of the validation process also warrants discussion. I am personally therefore very pleased to see that measures are finally being taken to apply the principles of free movement in practical terms. </p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the proposal for a directive contains some interesting provisions with regard to clarification. It provides that the host Member State must take account of all of the experience a person has gained since completing the qualification and can no longer demand countervailing measures. We clearly could have taken things a stage further, as will undoubtedly be inevitable for other jobs, and I hope that progress can be achieved with the assistance of a Council that is far less cautious in future. We shall no doubt discuss this issue again, but I hope that this evening’s debate will be welcomed as a step forward in the issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number of amendments proposed by Parliament aim to further improve the text of the Council’s common position by illuminating certain points that could otherwise be open to different interpretations. This is the case for Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 11, amendments which the Commission welcomes. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has taken note of the requests made in Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to codify the directive on “recognition of professional qualifications” and to re-examine the problem of recognition of formal qualifications acquired in third countries. In principle, the Commission does not object to these requests, but I would remind you once again that these requests do not belong in the preamble to the directive, especially since they are completely unrelated to the content of the directive. Their approval would contravene the rules governing technical legislation and the interinstitutional agreement that exists in this context. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding medical training, which forms the subject of Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10, the Commission shares Parliament’s view that on the one hand, this is a matter of great importance which requires further attention but on the other hand, these amendments only contain a few isolated proposals which require a more general analysis before they can be examined and approved. </p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation cannot be altered without a truly global analysis of the role of the GP, the role of the specialist doctor and the respective significance of basic training, specialist training and continuing training. This is why the Commission believes that it is far too early to adopt Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10. Moreover, it is said that these amendments will considerably delay the final adoption of the proposal, which would not just be terribly unfortunate, it would also be out of all proportion to the many benefits which we stand to gain from this draft directive. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are, in fact, not new. They contain the amendment already adopted at first reading, which was intended to regulate the situation of certain architects from Ireland. The Council and Commission have already explained why this amendment cannot be adopted, namely because this issue is a purely internal affair. </p>
<p class="contents">This concludes my response. I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to expand on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
