This simply defies belief, given the importance of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers have a right to decent incomes. The guarantee of profitable producer prices must, therefore, be the guiding premise of the common agricultural policy, in order to ensure farmers a decent standard of living on a par with other sectors of activity. This will in turn ensure that agricultural activity is sustained throughout EU territory. While these aims are enshrined in the CAP, the mechanisms of the policy – placing emphasis on reducing producer prices and on liberalising the agriculture markets both externally and internally – are entirely at variance with them. We know that this policy has been responsible for the disappearance of thousands of agricultural holdings and jobs, promoting the concentration, intensification and verticalisation of production, the centralisation of land ownership and the growing rural exodus.</p>
<p class="contents">It has, furthermore, exacerbated the injustice of the uneven allocation of agricultural production aid among producers, production and countries. It is this model that, twelve years after the 1992 CAP reform, perpetuates the profound injustice that 20% of the major holdings receive 80% of aid. In Portugal, 1% of the major holdings receive almost half of this aid, a situation that we have always contested.</p>
<p class="contents">The current reform of the CAP, with the decoupling of production aid based on historical references, perpetuates this imbalance. The decision not to proceed with genuine modulation and the establishment of aid limits was something of a missed opportunity. Aid should not be simply a matter of transferring money to rural development, but should instead act to offset the profound inequalities in the distribution of aid among farmers and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out that reduced prices of products and increased production costs, even taking into account the partial compensation of production aid, led to the disappearance of around 16% of agricultural holdings between 1995 and 2002. Not that consumers saw the benefits of these price reductions. The consumer price index rose, in fact, during the period concerned by around 11%, while the producer price index fell by more than 1%.</p>
<p class="contents">A determining – and worrying – factor in this situation is the gradual deregulation of the CAP’s market mechanisms, in addition to the fact that these mechanisms discriminate between continental and Mediterranean production. In view of the volatility and uniqueness of the agriculture sector, effective mechanisms must be introduced to regulate the market and to stabilise supply, so as to guarantee farm incomes. It is also important, as the rapporteur advocates, that we provide adequate external protection for agriculture and that we create Community mechanisms enabling us to intervene in any disaster that may befall the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that rural development should be strengthened, yet this would entail increasing the agriculture budget, not freezing it until 2013, as decided at the Copenhagen Council. Increasing the agriculture budget would make it possible to offer compensation to farmers in the least-favoured regions or to those on lower incomes. This is essential if we are to maintain multifunctional agriculture and high quality farm produce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to mention that hill and mountain farming does not represent a secondary aspect of European agriculture as a whole: it covers 20% of the useful agricultural area and 30% of land; and 5% of European citizens live in mountain areas. Leaving the mountains not only has economic but, as we know, also social and environmental effects. Leaving the mountains means endangering a whole system, the hydrogeological balance and the control of forest expansion. It means putting an end to every type of agro-tourism, which would lead to repercussions for valley areas too.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the possible solutions? To allow fixed and suitable compensation for hill and mountain farmers that takes account of the commitment to multifunctional agriculture; and to launch a specific but comprehensive policy for mountain areas that, for the most disadvantaged areas too, guarantees services and aid to improve the general quality of life and not, therefore, just the economic level of those who choose to live there.</p>
<p class="contents">The strong push towards rural development – shown in the recent reform of the CAP – gives some guarantee, but it is not enough. The specific nature of mountain areas needs to be explicitly recognised in the Treaties and in structural measures, and we need to have the courage to act with determination to overcome, as far as possible, the restrictions of State aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Comparisons of farm income can be very difficult: they depend on the base year used – 1995 in this case – and the figures vary depending on whether you take an aggregate, a family, a household or an individual measure. We must compare like with like.</p>
<p class="contents">Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2% in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion, and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64% of this figure. Our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 5.8% in 2002 to EUR 14 900. There are large variations, depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming. For instance, in 2002 average farm family income on the 40% of farms classified as full-time was EUR 27 760. On the 60% of farms classified as part-time, the income was only EUR 6 590. However, farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified. The 1999-2000 household budget survey shows that almost 60% of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources, contributing to the future viability of many farms.</p>
<p class="contents">On the average farm income in the EU in 2003, we ranked eighth. According to the most recent Eurostat estimate, average income per full-time job equivalent, adjusted to inflation, fell by 0.6% in Ireland in 2003, compared to an average increase of 0.9% in the EU as a whole. The distribution of direct payments in Ireland may be more equitable than in other EU countries, as there are relatively few very large farms, particularly arable farms. While the top 20% in the EU receive 73% of direct aid, our farm survey shows that approximately 40% of payments went to the 20% of farmers with the highest family farm income.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling. Public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector, and the European Union could be left covering the highest or uninsurable risks, which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the Council. A higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes. Before any rate is decided on, the first step should be to evaluate the Community's rural development needs, cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed to a major redistribution of direct payments, as suggested. The purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production. I have always supported the concept of decoupling. The aim is to avoid a major disturbance of production patterns and land values. Farmers have established entitlements and any redistribution would lead to losses and gains. Redistribution would also impact on production decisions by farmers, whereas the intention was to respond to market signals rather than force change upon them because of a fundamental change in the level of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry. The options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from WTO challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a report, which, not least, rekindles some of the issues and questions that we have put to the Commission during the current term: for example, the establishment of sectoral contracts to increase the level of quality, if necessary, but in any case to guarantee quality in agriculture; access to the European market for products from third countries that are subject to the same standards as European products; and a crisis management system. Furthermore, the report calls for consideration of the fact that the reduction and the fall in agricultural prices has not in fact had any effect on consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, however, and at a purely theoretical level – and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development know my position as regards the proposal for mid-term revision – I believe that we have taken on a huge responsibility, the effects of which we will be able to analyse only in a few years’ time, since the formula chosen for regulating the markets and stabilising prices – aid for production that is direct, fixed and de-coupled – will lead us to gradually dismantle the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We made choices based on a vision rather than on a foreign policy as regards Cancún. We have seen the results of Cancún, and we have seen how the talks at Geneva have been resumed. Among other things, I believe that some figures in the Garot report – the 7% increase in agricultural prices from 1995 to 2002 – refer to historical prices and do not, for example, take into account the inflation rate that has a marked effect upon agricultural prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole of the agricultural situation projected until 2011 in the European Union is, in my opinion, very much more sensitive, and with much more complicated rules, than the situation presented by Mr Garot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Income policy in the agricultural sector has a direct influence on the attractiveness of the farming life, and consequently on the continuation of agricultural production; connected with the effect it has on rural development. Europe’s farmers enjoy very widely differing levels of income. In recent years, agriculture has had to cope with profound structural change, and that is not yet over. Between 1995 and 2002 alone, the number of farms in the EU has decreased by an average of 15.7%. European farmer’s income consists in part of direct payments and not merely of production yield; moreover, the fall in prices for basic agricultural produce bears no relation to the way the prices paid by consumers for food have changed. In future, too, production costs will increase as a result of the greater demands made of agriculture, while farmers’ compensation payments will not be increased correspondingly.</p>
<p class="contents">What compensation payments must do is to guarantee that society’s needs are met: the desire for healthy and safe food and for an environment fit to live in. Compensation payments for agriculture are justified insofar as they reward its multifunctional services to society, above all – as Mr Santini said – in the mountainous, less-favoured, and peripheral regions of the EU. The European Union’s agriculture will also need a strong dose of entrepreneurship and an underlying production role. Farmers’ understanding of their own occupational role and their social status increasingly depend on to what extent the agricultural policy promotes farming enterprise. It is at this that the individual instruments must be targeted, but the common agricultural policy must not permit the first pillar to be played against the second.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor may we disregard the requirement that these agricultural policy instruments be provided over a specified period, thus making it possible to plan and act within a longer timeframe. There is no getting away from the Financial Perspective as a means of giving our farmers, to some extent, the certainty they need in order to plan ahead, which agriculture and rural areas need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Agricultural economics is a very important subject for the development of thriving rural areas. Thriving rural areas are entirely dependent upon the existence of profitable farms. In a Europe in which 50% of farmers are over 55 years of age and only eight per cent under 35, a whole new attitude to agriculture’s entrepreneurs is required. If I were now asked to give advice to people who had recently started up a farm, I would reply that they should make their financial calculations without reference to funding by society and not rely upon the good will of politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains a number of points I cannot support. For example, it talks about ensuring ‘a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilis[ing] incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Union’. A second point emphasises the importance of ‘maintain[ing] the level of public support for agriculture’ and the significance of creating ‘conditions that will guarantee employment’ and so forth. If these sentences, worded as they are, were read out to today’s farmers, they would leave them cold. In a country like Sweden, these words do not correspond to reality. Only 0.5 per cent of the population are now farmers. Restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly. The mid-term review has meant that everything has stopped, apart from the running down of agriculture. That is not of course something that can be blamed solely upon the European Community. A lot of the blame lies, for example, with the Swedish Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
