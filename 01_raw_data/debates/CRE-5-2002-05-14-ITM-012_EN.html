Many of the ideas that arose during these discussions were then taken on board in our proposals. As part of the discussion of the proposals between the various cabinets, some new issues arose, issues that required in-depth responses and in some cases further analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, we need to be in a position to undertake genuine reforms. Another point here is the need to go into all issues in detail. After all, this is ultimately not just about the Commission accepting my proposals, but also about an in-depth justification, particularly with a view to taking the wind out of the sails of potential opponents of reform. We must make sure that the reform package is comprehensive and solid.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now made good progress with our work. I am confident that I shall be presenting these proposals to the Commission at the end of this month. Normally, the draft would only be deferred by one week, but for various reasons this period has been somewhat extended, partly because I was not available at certain times.</p>
<p class="contents">I intended, and indeed still intend, to present the draft to the Commission without any substantive changes in the proposals. It is then of course up to the Commission to deliberate on this and to agree on a position acceptable to the majority of the Members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment. With regard to the procedure for rotating the Directors-General, I can assure you that there is no link between this and the proposals for reforming the common fisheries policy. Preparations for a broadly based rotation have already been in hand for some time, and the fact that the rotation issue and the reform package have come at the same time is pure coincidence. To suggest anything else would be quite wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful to the Commissioner for his reply and I hear him say that he wishes to take time to produce further analysis and to take the wind out of the sails of any potential opponent. I applaud any such effort. Unfortunately, what appears to have happened just now is that the wind has been taken out of the sails of the whole reform which has become becalmed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a position where we hope that we do not see the timetable derailed to the point where we may go beyond the end of this year and find ourselves in 2003 when some important derogations will have expired and we could potentially have a "free-for-all" in our fisheries throughout the EU. That would not benefit any of us and would not benefit fish stocks, which are nearing collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">We have waited for this reform package for years. Our fishermen are suffering.

The first was about timetabling. Let me try to be as clear as possible: at the end of this month, or to be precise on the last Wednesday of this month, I will be presenting the proposal to the Commission and it will be discussed within the Commission. That much is clear. What is more, this does not have any effect on the delay in the decision-making process, because even if we had agreed the Commission's proposal three weeks ago, the timing of the first discussion in the Agriculture Council and also in this House would have been the same.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your second question, I would like to reiterate what I have said and assure you that I am certainly not willing to be persuaded by anyone to go beyond the framework of the discussions on the Green Paper and to discuss the Commission's proposals.

However, it will not be possible for any instructions to be given to the Commission.

Perhaps the President of the Commission might be asked to make a statement on this matter. Also could he confirm whether the Director-General of Fisheries was moved as part of a routine package? Was it the case that every other person who was moved under that package had only a few hours notice of that move?</p>

I am in fact also a member of the Commission's 'reform group', and amongst other things I have always been in favour of this rotation principle applying to A1 and A2 officials, so that these top-level Commission officials should be regularly rotated.</p>
<p class="contents">There had already been a discussion at an earlier stage about Mr Schmidt possibly leaving during 2003, and I made it clear then that any change in the Director-General of Fisheries I had selected, and with whom I have a very good working relationship by the way, should take place either at the beginning of the reform, or at its conclusion, including the first phase of implementation. I think it is irresponsible for us to be having a change in top-level posts now, just when contacts with the Member States in the Council, with Parliament and above all contacts with the stakeholders are to begin. With my agreement, the Commission decided that this change should take place now, at the beginning, and that Mr Schmidt should be included in the package adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">It is highly regrettable that there have been communication problems and that Mr Schmidt was only informed of the Commission's decision at such short notice. But I repeat that this has no connection with fisheries reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, these children start being trained and schooled for careers in professional sport before they are even of school age. Such children are not, however, in a position to make their own decisions about their future and are very often turned into semi-professionals or even objects of exploitation, while being fed special ‘dietary supplements’.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that Europe is to host the forthcoming Olympic Games, can the Commission say whether it will take measures to tackle this problem, possibly as part of the campaign against doping which has already been launched and with reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, she has referred to the risks involved in taking part in major sporting events for minors, who are often professionals or semi-professionals. The subject of protection for young athletes was first approached in the declaration adopted by the European Council in Nice, which referred to the special nature of sport and its social function in Europe, and how these should be taken into account in common policies. The Commission addressed this subject in the context of the Helsinki Report on Sport and of the European Sports Forum held on 26 and 27 October 2000 in Lille, particularly in the workshop on youth protection, and the special position of young people under 18 was examined in depth during the discussions between the Commission and FIFA on the rules for international transfers of football players, which were concluded in March 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one thing we should not forget: protection of young athletes is largely the responsibility of the Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission's own initiatives have done a great deal to encourage dialogue between the Member States on this problem. In addition, whilst taking account of the principle of subsidiarity, measures have also been taken at Community level. For example, on 22 June 1994 the Council adopted Directive 94/33 on youth employment protection. This directive prohibits child labour, regulates work by minors and generally provides for all employees to guarantee that young people have working conditions appropriate to their age. The key objective of the directive is therefore to promote better working conditions for minors without enforcing a total ban. Lastly, the Commission has also launched various anti-doping measures, with particular reference to minors. In 1999, a report was adopted on a plan for the Community's role in combating doping. Furthermore, in the previous year various studies were financed, including a study on the protection of young athletes. Lastly, the Commission is currently working on ideas for the implementation of a new Community anti-doping plan, which is intended to give even greater weight to the problems of combating doping amongst young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Leaked Commission wish list concerning liberalisation of services in developing countries</span></p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the GATS negotiations (WTO), the Commission's Committee 133 is currently drafting the EU's wish list concerning the liberalisation of services in developing countries. The Commission considers such lists to be outside the public domain. But since 16 April, provisional lists for 29 countries have been publicly accessible via an NGO website. They show that developing countries are also being asked to open up certain service sectors which, even in the European Union, are considered sensitive. Has the Commission given preferential treatment to business? What role did the European Services Network play? Is it true that the Commission is calling for the opening-up of the water sector in developing countries, when Member States do not want to open up their own? Is there not some contradiction here? What is the relationship between the GATS negotiations and what the IMF requires of developing countries under its SAPs with regard to liberalisation?</p>

<p class="contents">In cooperation with Committee 133, the Commission is currently preparing its mandate for the GATS negotiations. Work is reportedly underway just now on a list of sectors the European Union wants to see included in the talks on liberalisation. Will the Commission explain how these important negotiations are being prepared for and say what sectors are on the Member States' wish list? Is it prepared to disclose this wish list to the European Parliament? It has repeatedly been affirmed that public goods such as education, healthcare and water would not be liberalised under any circumstances. Can the Commission confirm that this position will be maintained? Will the wish list be submitted to the General Affairs Council for approval, or do these matters fall wholly within the Commission's negotiating mandate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These leaks, because that is what they are, are regrettable, as they are disrupting our own internal preparation for the negotiations; the consultation process within the Community is not yet complete; we are merely at the initial discussion stage and we have by no means reached a final position at European Union level with regard to the drafts. In fact, in line with the procedures, we are in the process of consulting the Member States so that they can examine these initial requests, carry out their own internal consultations and submit their comments to us. This whole process will, at some point in the future, result in these draft wish lists being sent to Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaks are also regrettable in that they are damaging to our own negotiating position. By making this type of draft negotiation wish list public, we are clearly putting the third countries to which they are addressed under pressure, and they in turn have had to confront a number of questions on wish lists which, from our point of view, were still in draft form. Clearly, none of these things make negotiations any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, they are regrettable because, for once, the European Parliament has not been informed before the other institutions, and has been informed just after the Council, in any event, which is counter to the rules we established together. I would remind you that, within the constraints of the Treaty, which clearly gives priority to the Council, we have together adopted informal information and consultation procedures that have worked well so far. Moreover, I have no reason to doubt that they will continue to work well in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The final reason why these leaks are regrettable is that they give a kind of strange signal, as if a scoop had been made, as if this were a detective story and interesting discoveries had been made. This, however, is not the case, as the broad lines of these proposals are public, having been posted on our web site at the end of the year 2000, and there have been no changes to the political principles since then.</p>
<p class="contents">All negotiations comprise an initial stage for reflection, a second stage for transparency and a third stage for negotiation, out of the spotlight. For now, we are at the reflection stage. We have carefully consulted one another before sending our initial drafts to the Member States. I can assure you that, with regard to Parliament’s positions on the services negotiations, in which it has repeatedly emphasised the need to ensure that public services are respected, a concern, what is more, which is also shared by the Commission and which we have incorporated into our proposals, these positions are exactly the same as those initially indicated. We have indeed consulted and taken account of the points of view of a number of professional sectors and the points of view of a number of non-governmental organisations. None of these organisations have been given special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, these leaks are indeed thoroughly regrettable. Regrettable though they may be, however, they still have a positive side, since now that these secret documents have been made public, anyone who is interested will now be able to look at them closely and will see that these so-called secret proposals are entirely in line with the objectives that we stated publicly and that there is no hidden agenda, contrary to various accusations. In particular, they will see that we have no intention of either promoting or requiring the privatisation or dismantling of public services in any sector or in any country.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, in fact, there has been only one victim of the publication of these wish lists, and that is the myth of the hidden agenda, which has been so completely discredited that I am now sometimes even suspected of having organised this leak myself in order to show how greatly what we were doing in secret tallied with what we announced publicly. Naturally, I refute any statements of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">To get to the bottom of this, let us recall briefly that the WTO services agreement is the most flexible agreement imaginable, that it allows each country to draw up a list of activities for which it is willing to offer access to its market and treat foreign providers as nationals, that any country may exclude activities it considers to be politically sensitive from its commitments and that, as a result, the problems of differing economic and social situations in the participating countries are taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the members of the WTO have the sovereign right to regulate trading and other activities in their territory according to specific public objectives. This is the general principle. On the draft wish lists in question, in line with both the negotiation proposals we previously submitted and the objectives we have already stated, our requests concern a number of sectors, which I shall list briefly: the professions, business services, shipping, postal services, telecommunications, construction and engineering, distribution, environmental services, financial services, tourism, travel, transport and energy. Neither healthcare nor education, as you have just heard, are on this list, and we have not addressed any requests to third countries in either the healthcare or education sectors, and, I must add, we ourselves have no intention, at least at this stage, of making offers in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">One question remains, to which Mr van den Berg has drawn our attention: the issue of water in developing countries. This is indeed a complex matter. We, the Commission, are convinced that, in the case of water, we have good reason to address requests to third countries with regard to water supply. I must specify ‘water supply’, to distinguish it clearly from the problem of access to water resources, which is outside the scope of the WTO agreement on services. We consider, following a number of international works, that, if the billion or billion and a half people on Earth who have no access to water are to have access to it in the next ten years, we will need private funding. The volume of capital which needs to be invested in this type of infrastructure currently stands at around USD 200 billion. Current investments stand at around USD 70 to 80 billion. The difference cannot be remedied solely with public funds. We therefore consider that the GATS negotiations, if properly directed, could provide a useful contribution to an international effort that has been undertaken to achieve the WTO millennium objectives in the field of water.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, which was raised by Mr van den Berg. That is the question of the relationship between the requirements, or conditions, formulated by the IMF with regard to the LDCs and the WTO negotiations. On this point, the response is as follows: the services negotiations and the IMF structural adjustment programmes are not related. This being so, the developing countries that have or are said to have made commitments under the structural adjustment programmes should, if I may say so, use this to their advantage in the international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Until these conditions are consolidated by the WTO, they are not considered obligatory from the point of view of the WTO and, consequently, countries which, for one reason or another, have been obliged to accept or have accepted conditions of this type from the IMF may use this advantage in the WTO negotiations. As far as we are concerned, in any case, we are prepared to consider this very favourably. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, now that this list is before us, I see that the Commissioner has said that if we make a request, not one single country will be forced to endorse something which they do not want. They decide for themselves what the public sector represents.</p>
<p class="contents">As I understand it, the Commissioner works on the principle of commitment, and I would like to ask him whether he can confirm once more that as far as he is concerned – and this is also a dynamic between the Commission and Parliament – this commitment in principle means that whatever we do not want to do to ourselves or ask of ourselves – for example in the field of water or in education, health care or other sectors – we will not impose on others either. And that, should we deviate from this, we will have a careful exchange of views beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is crucial for us to be well acquainted with this political commitment, this clear line. And furthermore, I believe that Johannesburg is probably a good place to ensure that as far as water is concerned, access remains in public hands, but that financing from private sources could possibly be further developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a clear improvement as compared with the previous year, when the implementation rate for commitment appropriations was 82%. However, the picture was quite different for payment appropriations, where the utilisation rate of funds available was 82% in 2001, that is below the already low rate of the previous year, 2000, which was 88%.</p>
<p class="contents">The surpluses in budget year 2001 were chiefly due to inadequate utilisation of Structural Fund appropriations of EUR 9.4 billion, cohesion fund monies and funds under the pre-accession instruments – ISPA, Sapard and Phare. However, another not insignificant contribution to the 2001 budget surplus came from savings in the agricultural sector totalling some EUR 1.9 billion. In the case of the Structural Funds, the chief reason for underutilisation was delay in the introduction of programmes under the new 2000-2006 planning period. Two factors combined in the case of Sapard and ISPA – teething problems with new activities and setting up the necessary administrative structures in the accession states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very concerned about this trend and has already taken a variety of preventive measures to strengthen the measures adopted in 2001. These include calling on the Member States, who are responsible for implementing the programmes, to strictly observe the implementation plan for the period 2000 to 2006, including the n+2 rule under Article 31 of Regulation 1260/1999. This rule applies to individual programmes with effect from 31 December 2002, otherwise with effect from 31 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier specifically drew the Member States' attention to this rule in his letter of 21 November 2001. The Commission regularly updates the Member States about commitments where there is a risk that this rule could apply. The most recent update was in April 2002. The Member States were given a deadline of 31 March 2003 to submit their applications for final payments for programmes in the last planning period, that is the 1994-1999 programme planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Cohesion Fund, any decision on financing will set a binding deadline for presenting these payment appropriations. The Commission has indicated to the Member States that it is fundamentally opposed to any extension of these deadlines. Implementation of Structural Fund measures is in future to be more strictly monitored over the course of the year than has been the case up to now, in particular by means of the new payment forecasts to be prepared by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These forecasts are now notified to the budgetary authority as part of the budget procedure. Furthermore, the Commission will notify those Member States concerned that they run the risk of automatic cancellation of commitments that have remained unspent for excessively long periods. Estimates of Member States' requirements for the budget year 2001 under the Structural Funds in terms of payments due – excluding advance payments – were EUR 15 billion higher than the amount actually drawn by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards other budget lines, the Commission is anxious to refine its forecasting of requirements, and to further extend the implementation plan for the 2002 budget, so that an early warning system would identify any discrepancies between implementation needs and funds available in good time. This plan should enable budget implementation to be monitored over the course of the entire year, and a report will then be made to the budgetary authority in September and November 2002, as we have already promised you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my capacity as rapporteur for the Budget, I was naturally able to discuss this with Mrs Schreyer in connection with the debate on the 2003 Budget, but I preferred to deal with the issue in the form of questions, for this is a much bigger problem and one that is much more a matter of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary authority makes decisions about regional and aid policy because we want to achieve something in terms of employment in poor regions and in terms of aid to the world’s poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If we discover that a large part of what we have in fact made decisions about is not being implemented, then that is a major democratic problem which can lead to a decline in people’s confidence in the EU. I therefore believe that we must get the Member States, the Council, the Commission and Parliament to implement an action plan together in order for conditions really to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a final question for Mrs Schreyer. Does the Commission think that the Member States are sufficiently prepared to really do something about the problems? Sometimes, I get the feeling that the Finance Ministers of the Member States are enthusiastic mostly about the fact that they are getting money back.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there a genuine desire to really do something about the problems together with the Commission and Parliament? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, in 2001, nearly all available payment appropriations were implemented. This is really a major change compared with previous years. This is an area where reforms and above all the measures taken by my colleagues Chris Patten and Poul Nielson are really having a positive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the second part of your question, the Member States are certainly interested in seeing Structural Fund monies spent as well now. So you are quite right, on the one hand the Finance Ministers are of course pleased if money flows back into their coffers in any given budget year, but on the other hand it is those very same Finance Ministers who prepare forecasts about how much is drawn down from the structural funds in any year. So on the one hand we have forecasts and the enormous discrepancy between those forecasts and final out-turns, and on the other hand the fact that it is very much welcome when funds flow back.</p>
<p class="contents">At present we are considering how we can use instruments to make the forecasts on which we base our proposals more specific and perhaps also more binding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, in the case of measures to promote the development of rural areas, if the Member States' forecasts of their requirements deviate by a certain percentage from what prove to be their actual requirements, then that is deducted the following year as a kind of penalty. This is a very draconian arrangement, but it has been shown to work.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Commissioner Barnier has also been working on how we can improve the discrepancy currently existing in the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, in which you will be assessing this programme – if you have not already done so, because it was due to be assessed any time now – is the Commission going to do the same? What are you going to do to ensure that the Commission allocates 100% of its appropriations and that, furthermore, it keeps some projects in reserve, since these programmes reached the normal level of implementation that you mentioned, of 70% or 80%, which is then spent within the Commission?</p>

<p class="contents">According to the Institute for Security Studies, in 1999 the EU spent between EUR 1.5 and 2 billion on items relating in one way or another to armaments. Most of the money is channelled through the Structural Funds and the research and technology budget of the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.</p>

<p class="contents">In the case of the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the Commission points out that the text of the decision on the Fifth Framework Programme, which is currently underway, having been adopted by joint decision of Parliament and of the Council, stipulates that funding under this programme must be granted to projects with civil objectives. In practical terms, this means that specific support for the arms industry is not possible through the research framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the Structural Funds, the Commission launched a programme in 1993, in the context of a crisis in the defence industry, called ‘Konver’. This was an aid programme to convert the labour market areas most affected by the reduction in armament activities or the closure of military sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Community initiatives was to support the diversification of sectors heavily dependent on defence by converting production away from areas related to defence and developing the activities of industrial sectors other than the military sector. The multiannual Konver programme, which ran from 1994 to 1999, financed measures such as the acquisition of new civil qualifications by staff, the diversification of the economic structure of companies, aid for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, the reallocation of military sites to new civil sectors and the rehabilitation of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budget, the funding allocated to these Structural Funds is EUR 739 million at 1996 prices, which is an average of EUR 125 million per year. During the 2000-2006 programme period, Konver was abolished as a separate initiative, but actions financed by Konver are still possible within the context of programmes relating to objectives 1 and 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can the Commissioner confirm, or give us the assurance, that the money from the framework programme will not be used for these dual-use products?

First of all, with regard to the research programme, the Treaty and the texts relating to the Fifth Framework Programme are clear: the Commission has no legal competence in the field of specific military research as this field falls within the scope of intergovernmental cooperation and of the WEU. I am talking about Article 17 of the Treaty. The decision on the Fifth Framework Programme stipulates that the financial aid granted by the Community to research projects within the context of the Framework Programme will be used exclusively for civil purposes. It does not, therefore, authorise specific aid for research that is both military and civil in nature. The same is true of the proposal concerning the Sixth Framework Programme. It is also very clear that it is not, of course, always easy to assess the proportion of civil research that might be applied in the military sector. There are, for example, information technology research programmes which, although set up for civil purposes, could at some point have a military use. We are, however, only carrying out research programmes with civil objectives. That takes care of the research programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Konver, I have said that the actions financed by Konver are still possible within the context of programmes relating to Objectives 1 and 2, which are the responsibility of my colleague, Mr Barnier. I have no other information so I cannot tell you the proportion of actions currently financed by Konver under Objectives 1 and 2. I will say, however, that the aim of the Konver programmes is to convert the labour market sectors most affected by the reduction in armament activities or the closure of military sites. For that reason, the aim of these programmes is a socio-economic aim, which I believe is along the lines you advocate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the ethical framework of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, the rules proposed by the Commission are in line with Parliament’s amendment made at first reading on the Sixth Framework Programme as well as with the opinion of the European Group on Ethics. These are also based on the rules of the Fifth Framework Programme for Research.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s position was reiterated in a statement made when the Council approved the common position on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research. It implies that those participating in Community research programmes must strictly observe national legislation and codes of ethics. The local ethics committees or the appropriate national authorities must be consulted and give a favourable opinion or their agreement before research is undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already stated in our previous answer, in areas in which the Community has formal competence, which is the case in the area of research, national legislation should not prevent a specific Community-level action, which would have been adopted under the co-decision procedure involving the Council and Parliament. In this context, the Commission believes that the use of funds for research activities of the Sixth Framework Programme must be made whilst strictly observing decisions which will be taken under co-decision by the Council and Parliament. The Commission is also well aware that the respect of the various cultures and ethical approaches in Europe does not justify a <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> attitude.

The Commission has included the following statement in the Council’s Minutes: ‘In accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament concerning the proposal on the Sixth Framework Programme and taking into account the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the Commission believes that research in the following areas must not be financed by the framework programme: research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research activity resulting in the modification of the genetic heritage of human beings, which could make such changes hereditary, research activity to create embryos solely for research purposes or to supply stem cells, including somatic cell nuclear transfer’ and, of course, an article on animal experiments which must be replaced. This is the approach that we are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, however, each programme, each project in these areas can – and, in fact, must – be examined by an ad hoc ethics committee. It is not possible therefore to think too far ahead on this type of proposal which could be made at European level. In each Member State, research can of course be carried out in accordance with the legislation of each Member State. But at European level, this is the approach which seems to be most acceptable to everyone, or at least by a majority of MEPs and certainly by a majority of Council members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is convinced that we can and must reconcile these two dimensions, including in the area of genetic and pharmacogenomic testing.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, this involves, first and foremost, identifying and analysing the ethical, legal and social implications as early as possible in the development phases and before the technologies are widely applied. It is important to encourage ethics experts, lawyers and sociologists to work closely with scientists and manufacturers, in order to encourage their mutual education and a dialogue involving the main players, including patients, political decision-makers and the public in the widest sense. These initiatives will be included in the objectives of the Sixth Framework Programme for research, particularly under the first priority thematic area of ‘Genomics and biotechnology for health’.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wish to continue to stimulate research into ethics in order to increase knowledge and further understanding of the various approaches at European level.</p>

It was chaired by Mrs Lenoir and acquired, I believe, a certain reputation, a reputation as a result of its opinions. These are moderate opinions, which are generally accepted and are, of course, communicated to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that you had invited Mrs Lenoir to come before the House. I now understand that Mrs Lenoir has resigned from her position as chair for personal reasons, meaning that the European Group on Ethics, whose members had recently been appointed, will have to elect a new president, most likely in the next few months. Whatever happens, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is following events closely.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, up to now, the ethics group issued opinions – which were, of course, only opinions – and these were prepared in a pluralist manner. In other words, scientists, lawyers and sociologists all contributed – and it is important that this is the case for contributions to an open debate on these issues, which are, of course, fundamental but also delicate. The European Group on Ethics has so far produced some extremely valuable work and I hope that it will continue to do so in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A Council of Europe report entitled 'Extremist Threats to Democracy' reveals that there has been a surge in racist attacks on Roma in many of the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe. The report goes on to express fears that Roma are also subjected to discrimination of a clearly xenophobic and racist nature in the Member States, for which political forces participating in the governments of those States are partly responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this report reaches different conclusions from the optimistic reports produced by EU observers on the applicant countries' progress towards accession, will the Commission say what measures the applicant countries are taking to ensure a high level of protection for Roma from racial and ethnic discrimination? Will the Commission also provide information on the situation in the Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has repeatedly mentioned this and other deficiencies in its regular reports. Further efforts are needed, combined with appropriate financial support, to ensure that the various programmes are implemented in the candidate countries in a lasting way. I do not therefore share Mr Papayannakis's opinion that the Commission's conclusions in this area are too optimistic. I would be very happy to make the relevant extracts from the Commission's statements and reports available to you again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has constantly touched on this subject in the pre-accession strategy, and also regularly monitors developments. However, the issue of discrimination against Roma is a long-standing one of a very complex nature and we have to accept that extensive improvements will only be possible in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has demanded that all candidate countries with a significant Roma population should implement national action plans to combat discrimination, and that has indeed taken place. Various EU programmes have made an important contribution towards this. However, I also have to make it very clear that our political message to the candidate countries is that they are responsible for improving the position of Roma. We should not let these countries wriggle out of their responsibility for this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2000, the European Union adopted binding legislation banning racial and ethnic discrimination at the workplace, in education, in the social field, etc. A second directive bans discrimination at the workplace on grounds of religion and faith, disability, age and sexual orientation. The Member States have to transpose these directives into national law by 2003, that is to say that the future new Member States must implement these directives before they join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal framework goes hand in hand with an action programme with a budget of EUR 100 million which should increase our ability to combat racism and all other forms of discrimination. Furthermore, in November 2001 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council framework decision with a view to creating a legal instrument in the field of criminal law. The aim of this legal instrument is to ensure that racist and xenophobic behaviour in all Member States attracts the same sentences for the same offences. The second objective is to ensure that judicial cooperation in this area is enhanced and promoted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question, Commissioner, is this: we are calling for everyone else to do a whole host of things. But what are we doing? I do not mean programmes and money, I mean something else. You know that, because they have no country of their own to look after them, no place to call home, the Roma, of whom there are some 7 or 8 million, need to find a different mode of expression. They have set up a council, they have made a number of requests, they have asked for a pan-European forum, they have asked for special relations with institutions of the European Union, some sort of recognition because, as they have no country to recognise them and kick up a fuss about the holocaust, the horrendous holocaust which they suffered half a century ago, someone has to speak for them. We cannot speak for them. Do you intend to submit a proposal for us to recognise some sort of special representation of the Roma to the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, Turkish Cypriot exporters based in Northern Cyprus are required to use the stamp of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not recognised under international law by any state in the entire world except Turkey. That is why this stamp cannot be used as proof of the Cypriot origin of goods in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">On 5 August 1994 Cyprus's President Klerides formally notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations in writing that if the procedures laid down under national, European and international law were adhered to, Turkish Cypriots could export their goods in accordance with the same conditions as the population of the remainder of Cyprus. This letter accordingly gave a clear political undertaking on the part of the Republic of Cyprus to issue certificates of origin at the request of Turkish Cypriot exporters. It is therefore up to the Cypriots to reach agreement on how Turkish Cypriots are in practice to obtain certificates of origin issued by the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ludford, I am sure that we both agree with all the Members of this House that it will only be possible to find a solution to this incredibly difficult problem as part of the solution to the Cyprus question as a whole. That is why it is one of our objectives to solve this problem, which is also very unfortunate for Turkish Cypriots, so that the Cyprus question can be resolved this year before we take decisions on accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not refusing to trade. The problem is that the Turkish Cypriots are being prevented by their own 'authorities', and please note the quotation marks, from fulfilling the necessary requirements, by which I mean the certificates of origin that cannot be issued by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but only by the Republic of Cyprus, which is recognised under international law.

At present it is impossible to judge if the direct discussions in Cyprus about the resolution of the conflict will have the desired outcome. The Commission fully supports the direct discussions between the leaders of the two communities and their declared intention of finding a solution by the end of June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Cypriots have been invited to take part in the accession negotiations as part of the Cypriot delegation. This invitation has been on the table since 1998, but the Turkish Cypriots have so far unfortunately not accepted it. The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion. The Helsinki Strategy remains equally valid. The desired outcome is to solve the conflict, but that is not a prerequisite for Cyprus's accession. The Council will make the final decision taking account of all relevant factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not intend to send a note to the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, Rauf Denktash. However, the Commission is willing to continue the dialogue with Mr Denktash. I myself have had three detailed discussions with Mr Denktash during my period of office. These discussions covered all the key political issues around Cyprus's accession to the EU and the resolution of the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have reiterated what was said in Helsinki and of course I have a great deal of respect for that, but what I am referring to are the negotiations taking place between the two sides. These negotiations may finish in June. On the other hand, they may not. Does the Commission intend to make it clear to the Turkish Cypriots that if, for any reason, they obstruct the negotiations or give us to understand that they will probably agree next year, Cyprus will still accede to the Union? As you know, this is a scenario which is currently being discussed. We may have a situation where Cyprus does not accede to the European Union due to obstruction on the part of the Turkish Cypriots, who give us reason to believe they will agree later, with the result that we delay Cyprus's accession to the European Union.

Every word I used was important. The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion. That means that the decision on accessions will be taken in Copenhagen at the end of this year, as planned. As I can safely assume that the negotiations with Cyprus will have been concluded by then, and, as you know the negotiations with Cyprus are going extremely well, the decision about Cyprus will of course also be taken at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">One of most important political messages I had to send during my most recent visit to Cyprus and also during my most recent visits to Turkey and Greece was that the timetable for expansion would be respected regardless of the situation in Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just a few months ago, at the German-Czech Coordination Council in Berlin a representative of the Czech ODS party denied that representatives of the German minority who were present were loyal to the Czech state.
