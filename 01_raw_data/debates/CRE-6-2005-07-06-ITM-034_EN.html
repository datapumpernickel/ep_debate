<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic"></span></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearing and settlement are not only the back office of the financial institutions, they are the backbone of the securities market and hence of the capital markets. They constitute all the provisions that investors and financial operators need to hold and transfer securities. Clearing and settlement do not affect the capital markets: they <span class="italic">are</span> the capital markets. They contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial world and of the economy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is widely acknowledged that cross-border clearing and settlement are hindered by a number of barriers, the nature and impact of which vary, as you know. This situation considerably increases the costs of clearing and settlement at European Union level in comparison to national systems, and particularly in comparison to the situation in the United States. It also increases the risks, legal and otherwise, of cross-border transactions. It therefore clearly constitutes a major hindrance to cross-border investments, to the diversification of portfolios, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that we have not yet achieved a European Union market in this field, with the result that we cannot benefit from the advantages of the growth in the European Union that an efficient clearing and settlement system could bring, and that we will not be able to compete effectively at global level. To put it bluntly, the objective of all issuers of securities being able to reach all investors is still a long way from being achieved. That is why the Commission welcomes the interest that the European Parliament is taking in this issue in responding to the Commission communication of April 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s declared objective is to promote the creation of secure and efficient clearing and settlement systems in the European Union, guaranteeing conditions of fair competition for the various issuers. We want to eliminate the obstacles to cross-border clearing and settlement, and thus to enable clearing and settlement service providers, if they so wish, to access other markets in the European Union and provide their services in those markets, within a commonly accepted regulatory and supervisory framework. In other words, we want to create a genuine market in clearing and settlement. Our aim is to make cross-border clearing and settlement just as cheap, just as efficient and just as secure as the national clearing and settlement systems in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the communication launched very extensive consultations on our initial approach to the policy to be adopted in this field. Our policy sought not simply to manage the current market situation but to improve the future environment for clearing and settlement in the European Union. This environment would enable the operators to implement their strategy, firstly without being hindered by superfluous barriers, and secondly in full compliance with essential public interest objectives such as the security of the systems, fair competition, efficiency and so on. The aim, in cooperation with the private and public sectors, was to eliminate the Giovannini barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we considered it essential to ensure that clearing and settlement service providers were not prevented from entering other EU markets and providing their services there, nor faced with unreasonable conditions when they wished to do so, simply because the competent authorities refused to recognise the equivalence of the regulatory systems or supervisory practices of other Member States. If this type of barrier were not lifted, the benefits of lifting the Giovannini barriers, which is the responsibility of the private sector, would be diluted or not fully exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">These are complex issues, which is why we are being rigorous about applying our twofold commitment to have ongoing consultation and an in-depth impact assessment. With regard to ongoing consultation, we have set up three groups that are working very intensively. The CESAME Group monitors and encourages the progress made by the private sector towards lifting barriers. As you are aware, this group’s authority and visibility are already indisputable. The Legal Certainty Group examines issues related to cross-border legal certainty with respect to legal compatibility when securities are held via intermediaries. The Fiscal Compliance expert group (FISCO) examines cross-border differences with regard to fiscal compliance and aims to reduce the burden of fiscal compliance in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to assess the possible impact of any regulatory intervention, a team representing all the services of the Commission is currently conducting a huge impact assessment with a view to gaining a robust instrument, before deciding whether it is appropriate to propose a directive on settlement and clearing and, if so, of course, to determine its precise content. This approach corresponds perfectly to the point of view expressed in Mrs Kauppi’s report. We think that we will be able to meet the deadline of the first half of 2006 for completing the impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of our commitment to consultation and impact assessment is also illustrated by the contact that we have had with the various rapporteurs responsible for this report. Following an initial draft report on the basis of relatively clear-cut theories, all of the parties concerned – the rapporteur, the experts advising the Commission, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission secretariat and staff – put a great deal of effort into this matter. This openness to debate, dialogue and consultation on the part of the many parties involved in this matter is a model of cooperation for the work that we do together and I would like to thank the European Parliament for taking this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been nice to talk to him personally.</p>
<p class="contents">When I took over this report from Mrs Villiers, who deserves considerable thanks for her thorough approach and hard work, it was quite clear to me what the outcome should be. It is even clearer now.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the Commission recently produced a Green Paper on financial services. It explicitly stated that any new European proposal for financial services legislation and implementing rules should pass a number of economic tests. They involve a careful study of the expected economic benefits as well as ‘the extent to which measures facilitate cross-border business and enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s financial markets, while, at the same time, protecting internal stability’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission paper also states that there is clear market evidence suggesting that genuine financial integration is under way in many key sectors, such as in clearing and settlement. That sentiment is strongly echoed in our daily dealings with the financial services industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before you sends a clear signal to the markets that the achievements will not be hampered by unnecessary regulation. That message is a result of a broad cross-party compromise and it has the strong backing of market participants. Some of the amendments that have been tabled depart from this functional approach and seek to prejudge the need for regulation. I appreciate and respect the cultural differences in regulatory philosophy, which lead some to these conclusions. However, it would be a serious mistake to apply this <span class="italic">ex ante</span> philosophy in the case of clearing and settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed to wait for the results of the regulatory impact assessment and of the different working groups set up by the Commission, to which you referred, Commissioner, in order to determine whether there is any market failure and whether a directive is the right solution after all.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, our clear signal in support of the developments that are taking place in the clearing and settlement markets should not be diluted with confused concerns regarding potential developments sometime in the future, for which no evidence currently exists. I refer here to some Members’ wish to implement <span class="italic">ex ante</span> competition rules for clearing and settlement service providers. There is no need for that at this stage, as evidence suggests that markets are, in fact, generally developing towards more open and transparent competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for new competition legislation is a misguided call for a short-term directive, with the risk that it will develop into wide-ranging legislation on clearing and settlement before we have the results of the different Commission impact studies. Instead, the plenary tomorrow should fully endorse the committee line, that we should focus our efforts on the removal of the ‘Giovannini Barriers’. Here I fully support the initiatives of the Commission. The removal of such barriers promotes openness, equal access and transparency in the industry. We should not seek to implement some arbitrarily defined single utility or service model across the EU, as that would hamper ongoing market-led cross-border integration and consolidation, along with the tangible benefits accruing to customers of clearing and settlement services.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has stated, this is not a technical, minor issue. It is a very important field of the single market. I fully appreciate Commission efforts in this respect. I would like to thank all your staff who have worked hard with Parliament in reaching this compromise. I hope we can continue this very fruitful cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly a good thing that our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has reached a sound compromise on this subject and I would like to thank Mrs Villiers and also my colleague, Mrs Kauppi, for that.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise relies above all on market players finding solutions to the problems that arise. This is a good approach because this sector has not broken down: it is operating effectively. Let us therefore retain free competition as a basic principle, so that this sector can evolve, innovate and, above all, remain competitive at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission is in the process of assessing the need for legislation in this field. I would strongly encourage it to use the impact assessment to demonstrate the necessity, the costs and the benefits of each measure. At this stage of the debate, the Commission has a duty to go beyond general explanations and to show all the stakeholders that its actions are resulting in real progress. I do not need to remind you that publishing this impact assessment before proposing a text seems to me to be the only valid way of ensuring an open discussion on this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that priority should be given to removing the barriers defined in the Giovannini reports. This aspect is worth emphasising, since the Commission, in its communication, showed very little enthusiasm for attacking the legal barriers that are responsible for the excessive expense of cross-border transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is not convinced of the benefits of greater regulation and rejects the concept of public utility for this sector. The report itself prefers the concepts of non-discriminatory access and transparency of pricing structures. This too is a good balance and Parliament has a duty to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, is that the additional amendments tabled in the plenary seek primarily to distort competition between the various different types of institutions and, in fact, to reduce competition in the sector, which must not be the aim. In my view, these amendments should therefore be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ieke van den Burg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, on her well-balanced report, which is supported by most of the political groups and a large majority of the financial services industry. She has been active in finding compromises. We are still working on it: Mrs Starkevičiūtė from the Liberal Group, Mrs Berès and myself So you can see that the issue of clearing and settlement in the EU is really a ladies’ world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kauppi took over from another lady, Mrs Villiers, who left the European Parliament to become a Member of the House of Commons in Britain. My Group was not very happy with her approach. In the explanatory statement of this report you can still find a reminder of her approach, which was very much anti-legislation and principally and vehemently against a directive on clearing and settlement. My Group and the PPE-DE Group do not exclude the need for a directive. This was also the starting point in the Andria report from a previous parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">We have chosen not to engage in an ideological battle about whether to have legislation, but to list pragmatically the issues to be taken into account politically, to assess the necessity, feasibility and desirability of legislation or other forms of regulation, and to wait for the factual impact assessments that the Commission is currently carrying out before making up our minds definitely. This is a more pragmatic and wise approach and I am happy that we managed to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I wish to repeat some concerns. I should like to see a decent system of integrated European supervision – also in relation to competition rules. The Commission should keep a close eye on anti-competitive developments that could take place in this fragile clearing and settlement market, particularly in relation to possible consolidation of stock exchanges in Europe. I have noted that the Bundeskartelamt has just given the green light for a possible merger of Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange, although this is no longer a real option. The UK Competition Commission will very soon deliver its opinion on this possible merger or on the other combination of Euronext and LSE.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have already raised the question of whether the European Commission should be more proactive and not leave it to the national competition authorities to judge the developments, because the financial markets – in particular the post-market activities – can have an enormous impact on these markets. At least we should monitor the various aspects from the point of view of competition and the impact on the smooth functioning of the European financial markets. My Group does not exclude <span class="italic">ex ante</span> competition rules as a consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">Unbundling of different elements in the clearance and settlement value chain is not something we propose at this stage, but I would like to have more assurance that cross-subsidies do not exist in this industry and that custodian banks are free to transfer securities outside their home conglomerates.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying that CESR – the Committee of European Securities Regulators – has already been active on this issue, which has not always been welcomed by our committee, because what it was doing was not very transparent. It must be said that at least it has been proactive. I hope we can improve on the cooperation and the further elaboration of this regulation on clearing and settlement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we will be able to begin to solve this problem, as it is one of the European Union's economic policy decisions that has already been the subject of lengthy debate, although the results have yet to be seen. It is the cause of the backwardness of the European Union's financial markets compared with other financial markets in the world. We need to make considerable progress. What needs to be done to achieve this progress?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I want to address market participants. They must make mutual concessions and begin to look for common ground and compromise. I understand perfectly that it is difficult to renounce those positions that have already been reached as settled systems on a national level, as this is linked to new expenditures, as well as problems and uncertainty in the future. For this reason, we the Members of the European Parliament must reach an agreement and clearly show the market the way to develop a clearing and settlement system, so that it is possible to ensure the forecasts and clarify these predictions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must assure that we solve the questions related to price structure clarity, levels and the true rights of access for all participants, as well as those questions related to equal competition in the market. These are the three main segments.</p>
<p class="contents">If we manage to reach an agreement (and I trust that we shall), then national governments will be obliged to act more decisively to remove the obstacles indicated in the <span class="italic">Giovannini </span>accounts. I doubt whether any national government can afford not to listen attentively to requests from the financial sector. After all, they are the governments' main creditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to address the Commission on this point: you now have sufficient work groups and the power for all technical decisions, legislation and amendments to be adopted as quickly as possible. Why do we need to hurry? Now is a perfect opportunity for the European Union's market to become the world leader.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably most specialists know that uncertainty lingers in the US market due to the methods of regulation chosen. The countries of Asia are still forming their markets. We have a splendid chance to break into the lead, and must not miss such an opportunity. Thus, our compromise today and mutual concessions may yield significant material benefits and recognition as a separate, strong power in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not mind admitting that I rather do.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent years in the European Union and the United States have shown that financial markets are very sensitive and sometimes react strongly to external developments. The stability of the markets cannot be taken for granted, but the effective management and smooth settlement of transactions on the basis of clear legislation does help to foster it, and so Mrs Kauppi’s report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities transactions does deserve our undivided attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Securities trading is organised in complex ways, and it is also difficult to monitor. Solutions imposed by means of a directive do not always produce the desired outcome. I should like to stress that solutions must be transparent and verifiable if confidence in the financial markets is to be maintained. In this connection, it is vital to monitor the development of aspects of competition. The resolution of 2003 contains the urgent request for more studies into aspects of competition with a view to developing a transparent market for the settlement of securities transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to back the rapporteur’s comments on the ramifications of introducing a directive. The aim is to remove the Giovanini obstacles, but those can also be kept in check without a directive, by means of coordination and consultation. I should also like to point out that another cross-border issue, the removal of obstacles to cross-border payments, was tackled very successfully at the time and also involved a complex number of organisations, rules and interests, thus demonstrating that it is possible to remove obstacles that appear virtually insuperable. It is therefore time for the numerous settlement costs that hamper the internal market for securities in its cross-border activities to be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi once again for the work they have done on this directive. I think they have produced an excellent piece of work that will help us move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a divisive subject, but we have succeeded in setting aside our national interests in order to reach, in my view, a sound and constructive compromise that will enable us to remove the existing barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement transactions. This compromise is based on the idea of not pre-empting the results of the impact assessment currently being conducted by the European Commission. Nevertheless, we felt it was important to remind the Commission of the principles that should guide the consolidation of this sector, which is so essential to a robust and smoothly functioning European banking system and thus to the financing of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, free competition. The system must guarantee undistorted competition between the various operators, whatever their size or activities. I am pleased that the text does not rule out the separation of activities, when that same separation is advocated in all other industrial sectors as a means of avoiding cross-subsidisation and the dumping that ensues. In addition, I hope that the Commission will be able to conduct a proper <span class="italic">ex ante</span> examination of dominant positions in the market, including in cases where turnover is below the required threshold, but where the impact of such mergers on our economies would certainly justify such an examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, transparency: even though our compromise does not, at this stage, allow me to recommend the separation of the various different post-market activities, it is vital to reaffirm that transparent pricing structures are an essential guarantee for those in this sector who might benefit from fair and undistorted competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, security, since the major challenge here is of course to ensure that the European financial system is secure and can guard against both systematic and operational risks, and also against the criminal activities of certain parties.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore refuse, at this stage, to rule out any instrument, directive or free organisation of the market, or any model, with or without separation of activities, that could be used to consolidate post-market activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think it is likely that a legislative text will be necessary in order to remove legal and fiscal barriers, if appropriate to adapt the European rules on competition to these activities and, finally, to provide the transparency and accounting separation necessary to the existence of fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that it is time to make progress in this field, because European consolidation is underway, without supervision. Having successfully harmonised the markets, we urgently need to harmonise the post-market sector if we want to benefit from all our work in the context of the financial services action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

New legislation is only justified if the social and economic benefits are clearly established. We are pleased that we will be able to continue the discussions and the exchange of information with Parliament as we receive more specific results from the various expert groups and from our impact assessment exercise.</p>
