<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">– (NL) </span>Madam President, this is already the third time that we have discussed this topic and the Council and Parliament spent an exciting night bringing things to a conclusion. It will surprise no one that the discussion in our Conciliation Committee that evening was dominated by the judgment of the Court on the tobacco advertising directive. There are many legal aspects attached to this and the question is whether we can now be certain about all the legal aspects that were raised. No, of course not. After all, we were dealing with a different case with different provisions attached in that judgment by the Court, but we certainly believe that we acted in accordance with the spirit of the Court’s judgment, and no more could be expected of us. Agreement was reached on the export provision, so that from 2007 onwards the same criteria will apply to tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide as to products sold within the European Union. In that sense things have been brought into line with the judgment of the Court. I am also happy to see that this topic has now also been raised in the World Health Organisation. We have reached agreement on the publication of ingredients and on the common list of ingredients. An extraordinarily important and pioneering provision. Ultimately the internal market is best served by a common regime in the field of ingredients and testing, as is public health. It is also important from the point of view of a possible future assessment of less harmful tobacco products. In relation to the regulation of snuff, for example; it is no secret that I personally belong to the minority here who felt it could perfectly well have been sold in the European Union, but we shall come back to that in the report of the Committee at the start of the next parliamentary term and probably also in relation to other, less harmful tobacco products that are still being developed. This topic will definitely be a political challenge to us all. We have reached agreement on warnings. In our view there can be no question of a ban on tobacco products and whether one likes it or not smoking is an individual, adult decision, as long as one does not harm others, provided it is based on adequate information. The consequences of smoking are so serious that consumers must be properly warned and we are now going further – though to my taste still not far enough – in the direction of the Canadian legislation, which is more intelligent that what we have been able to achieve so far in the European Union. I am very gratified that Member States have agreed to the option of printing pictures if they so wish and call on the Commission, when it comes to more detailed regulation at the end of 2002, to look closely at what has been developed abroad, for example in Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the matter of misleading descriptions. Large cigarette manufacturers, such as Philip Morris, agree with what Parliament and the Council were trying to achieve on this point. Naturally a misleading description, whether a commercial brand or not, cannot be allowed on the market, but legally it is a difficult business, perhaps particularly when it concerns a word like “mild”. In the Conciliation Committee we finally opted for the formulation proposed by the Council which is based on the cosmetics directive and I believe that in so doing we have chosen a sensible path that is also legally sound.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the Council. Although the Portuguese Presidency worked on this in the preliminary stages and the Swedish Presidency in the final phase, I have the greatest appreciation for the French Presidency, which played a crucial role on this point and also for the Commissioner. Perhaps I may for once breach protocol and also mention John Ryan who has been active for years in the Commission on this matter and has played a crucial part. My thanks also to the parliamentary delegation for their patience during this odd conciliation night and to Sabine Magnano and Klaus Beyer for their administrative support, but I should like to single out Renzo Imbeni, our delegation Chairman that evening, who dragged away our major points from the jaws of hell or at any rate from the jaws of the Council. I also believe that the participation of non-governmental organisations and of industry was positive. They were able to achieve a lot with their contribution. It was a remarkable conciliation. I have three concluding observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, Parliament, the Commission and the Council gave a joint press conference which was a novelty and a positive experience. I should like to mention the rapid decision-making. In scarcely a year we managed to get this controversial and complex legislation carefully onto the statute book. Where are those slowly grinding Brussels and Strasbourg wheels that are always talked about?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the final result is, I believe, better than either the joint position of the Council or the final text of Parliament. This shows that the codecision procedure with equal involvement of Parliament, despite its cumbersome nature, is nevertheless the best way of reaching decisions in this Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed it on a number of occasions. It is a thorny problem because various conflicting interests are at issue, especially those of health and of industry. These in turn involve largely small and medium-sized businesses, which form the heart of the economy. Jobs are also at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission should have come up with a new directive and should have taken the initiative in the health field of doing everything possible to combat the consequences of smoking, for example by reducing nicotine content, banning harmful substances, by warnings and better labelling, by highlighting the danger of passive smoking and through product information. In the field of the harmonisation of the internal market, it wants to do its utmost to combat different starting positions and to remove trading obstacles, by, for example, stating nicotine content, and by further harmonising policy on warnings and product information. I hope that we can really achieve reciprocal recognition of testing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Exports to third countries are a sore point. Personally I take the view that what we regard as inadmissibly harmful to the inhabitants of the EU should not be exported to other countries, even if they have no legislation in that field. I deplore the fact that this may have adverse consequences for employment in certain countries. I would like to observe, however, that in my view more jobs have been lost through restructuring or the closing of companies by the industry itself than from political regulation. For that reason I am for the time being reasonably optimistic. I also believe that we have reached a reasonable compromise on transition deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legal basis, I would point out that this directive builds on three existing directives. I therefore assume that we have a good legal foundation, having listened to, among others, the legal advisers of Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion two more general observations. The first is on young people and smoking. I would welcome it if the Member States could strengthen their efforts to advise young people against starting smoking, for example through pricing policy or, for example, by making points of sale unattractive and inaccessible or by prohibiting the free distribution of cigarettes on café terraces or near schools. That is not universal.</p>
<p class="contents">A second observation concerns the subsidies on tobacco. On the one hand we have this directive aimed at discouraging smoking which points out the health dangers, but at the same time Europe continues to give huge subsidies for tobacco growing. It is my view that these should be gradually phased out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to compliment the rapporteur on the end result and thank him for the successful cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee endorses the rapporteur's excellent work and consolidates the climate of cooperation established in this House on a matter which is so very sensitive for the European citizens. The text upon which we are about to vote is a considerable improvement on the text proposed by the Commission and an even greater improvement on the situation prior to that.</p>
<p class="contents">For once, the rules harmonising the internal market have given greater consideration to the health of the European citizens than to the interests of the large manufacturers. This text is, once and for all, a significant example of how the European Union intends to respond to the citizens' ever-increasing demand for protection of their health. We hope fervently that other sectors, such as the food safety sector, will soon follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Without plunging straight into a discussion on the content of the agreement, I would like to stress two key points. The first is the extension of the obligation to apply tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ceilings to cigarettes intended for third country markets as well. This measure was at the centre both of the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of debate in Parliament. Some people, protecting the interests of exporting companies, maintained that this act would certainly not represent a Union contribution to the improvement of world health, while others took the line that what is harmful to Community citizens is also harmful to third country citizens, making clear, at the same time, the need for a sufficiently long transitional period to give operators in the sector the chance to convert to other production areas. We advocated the latter approach, and the text adopted in conciliation takes this line.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point concerns the definitive regulation of the substances added to tobacco products. Indeed, in addition to being used to achieve the characteristic flavour and aroma of a certain product, these substances serve to increase the dependency of smokers. Our directive will mean that, not only will manufacturers and importers of tobacco products have to declare the exact composition of products placed on the market but they will also have to justify the inclusion of every single ingredient. Moreover, by 2004, the Commission will have to present a proposal defining a common positive list of authorised ingredients. These are not minor measures. Along with the banning of descriptors<span class="bold"> </span>and the increasing of the area devoted to medical warnings, these measures can genuinely make a major contribution to the fight against smoking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Surely it is axiomatic that rapporteurs do their work well? However, I should like to make an exception for Mr Maaten. Because this report proves that if one plays an active role as a rapporteur and hence also takes consultations with the Council and the Commission very seriously and makes a point of getting people together around a table, one can actually succeed. That is of course also dependent on the Commission and the Council. That is why it is gratifying that we can present this example at the end of the Swedish Presidency. In fact you could take this report into the schools and say: Look, this is an example of the way in which a European directive can be produced through consultation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. I wish that were the case on more matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to come to the point. I have been in politics for quite a time and when I first took part in framing legislation on limiting advertising and on warnings on cigarette packets, it was actually seen as something completely absurd by many of my colleagues. Since then the fight against tobacco addiction and the regular use of tobacco has become universally accepted. Still, there are differences. I remember that on the first occasion when I went to Sweden for a meeting – I still smoked at the time – the smokers were put in a separate room together, where of course it stank terribly. That was where you had to smoke, but it did not taste good at all. Smoking was completely forbidden in the meeting room itself. There was a sign, and I had never seen that before since I came from a culture where meeting and smoking were as it were associatively linked. I now observe that the social pressure on smokers has increased in most countries and that great progress has been made thanks to the campaigns, despite scepticism about them many years ago. The number of non-smoking train compartments must be increased everywhere. More and more we insist on using and meeting in non-smoking areas. Nevertheless social pressure must be stepped up to a point where young people especially do not start smoking, and women to not take up smoking either. It is painful to see that despite the campaigns so many people are still starting to smoke. I experienced first hand that giving up smoking is a lot more difficult than starting. Having said this I hope that the strict regulations that run counter to the spirit of the lobbyists and their interests, will be followed up, and I believe that the measures proposed by Mrs Martens to abolish the subsidising of tobacco growing might give a healthy impetus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to note that these do not just affect smokers themselves, but also those who spend time in smoky environments, those with allergies as well as many others. Smoking also leads to substantially increased health care costs in many countries. In our capacity as politicians, our task is to warn of the risks of smoking, to reduce the harmfulness of tobacco products and to attempt to get rid of misleading marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that the conciliation we have achieved with the Council of Ministers is an obvious step in the right direction in this area. In the GUE/NGL Group, we are, for example, particularly satisfied with the requirements for a lower tar content, the limit values for nicotine and carbon monoxide, clearer warnings and the requirement for companies to list additives. We see the results in these areas as major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In two areas, we would have liked measures to have been taken more quickly, but we feel that we are at least on the right track. This applies to the ban on misleading brand names, for which no date has been set for implementation, something which we would have liked to have seen. This will have to be a future task. There is at least one commitment in this direction for the future. We would also like there to have been faster progress regarding export bans on tobacco products that are not approved under EU rules. It is rather embarrassing that it is all right to export what we consider to be dangerous to health in our own countries. We should have preferred to have seen these products banned simultaneously in the EU and for export, but at least a ban has been set for the year 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier in this conciliation, Swedish snuff was discussed, and we believe that a good solution has been arrived at in this area too. It means that the exemption under which Sweden may keep its traditional snuff will be retained without the market in other EU countries being opened up. We believe that other EU countries have the <span class="italic">right</span> to refuse this product if they wish to forgo it, which no doubt a number of them will.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we are very satisfied with the result of the conciliation and feel that the rapporteur has done a good job. If we were to be slightly critical, we could say that the EU has problems of credibility when it comes to its tobacco policy as a whole. Possibly EUR 1 billion per year is still spent on subsidies for tobacco cultivation. If we are to make our work on combating the harmful effects of tobacco smoking more credible, it is perhaps time to start phasing out these subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur for his handling of this report through three readings and lengthy negotiations with the Council in the conciliation process. The final text which we will vote on tomorrow is to be welcomed as the fruit of successful negotiation. The House has made it clear from the beginning that we expect strict rules to be applied in the whole area of producing, packaging and marketing cigarettes and other tobacco products.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that 80% of first-time smokers in the EU are below the age of 18. Statistics suggest very clearly that in the EU smoking kills half a million people annually. Cigarette smoking is the cause of fatal diseases amongst a quarter of all smokers. Smoking causes 85% of all cases of lung cancer and half of all premature deaths among life-long smokers are caused by the use of tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward. Member States have been attentive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and have taken the most important aspects of our recommendations on board. In Ireland smoking kills six times as many people per year as road accidents, work accidents, murder, drugs, suicide and Aids combined. Seven thousand deaths occur in Ireland each year from tobacco-related illnesses and one third of these occur before the age of 65. Twenty-five per cent of all heart-related diseases are caused by smoking. In conclusion, these are astonishing statistics which I am confident this Parliament will continue to work to reduce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Smokers are less long-lived and their health is less good. Smoking is therefore a serious threat to public health. Reason enough to discourage smoking then. However, many people already smoke. In Northern Europe these turn out to be people with low educational attainment and lower incomes. Because of the addictive effect giving up proves very difficult. Unfortunately it is still the case that many young people start smoking. The policy of tobacco manufactures expressly targets this market by giving cigarette smoking a tough and sporting image in advertising. Once the tobacco industry has won over a young person, it is generally assured of another regular customer. Customer loyalty is further strengthened by increasing the addictive effect through additives that facilitate the absorption of nicotine. In addition the tobacco industry tries, through the use of misleading messages like ‘mild’ and ‘light’, to create the impression that the tobacco products concerned are less harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive at present being finalised is an adequate response to the above-mentioned problems. I should also like to thank Mr Maaten from this platform for his great commitment and for the result achieved. The Swedish Presidency also ensured that this file was processed quickly, for which it earns my praise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when in December last year Parliament had approved 32 amendments on second reading, things looked very different. There were disappointed noises from the Council. Obviously it had not been expected that Parliament would want to change so much in the common position. Indeed, the Netherlands Minister of Health felt that the European Parliament was weakening the directive. However, I believe that most amendments were an improvement of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reprehensible that this Minister should have criticised the ‘questionable’ role of the European Parliament on the grounds that Parliament was dancing too much to the tune of the cigarette industry. It is true that the cigarette industry lobby was working flat out, but obviously with little success, and just as well too. The European Parliament even wanted to make the warning message on a packet of cigarettes more forceful by replacing the general warning ‘smoking kills’ or ‘smoking can kill’ with more confrontational texts like: In the EU half a million people die each year from the consequences of smoking, or smoking causes cancer and heart diseases or passive smoking is harmful to those around you, especially children. In fact that is more accurate, since no one dies immediately as a result of lighting up a cigarette. Unfortunately, however, these texts from the Council were not changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Other unhealthy results of smoking included blackened smokers’ lungs and rotten teeth. Therefore I see no objection to confronting smokers on cigarette packets with what they are doing to themselves and to their environment. It is precisely the intention that confrontation should have a preventive effect. I am therefore gratified that Council has adopted this idea from Parliament. I also support a ban on misleading messages, such as ‘mild’ and ‘light’.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive point is that in the preamble attention is drawn to additives which heighten the addictive effect. Although an outright ban on the adding of ammonia or ammonia compounds would have been preferable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I again feel obliged to emphasise that European policy is inconsistent. On the one hand the use of tobacco is discouraged, on the other over EUR 1 billion is spent annually on tobacco subsidies. I feel that many more roll-ups will be made before these subsidies, which now simply go up in smoke, are reduced to zero. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it can be said that there is no greater killer on the grounds of lifestyle than cigarettes. It was good that the industry did not succeed in getting Parliament and others to falter in connection with the legal basis. Now, we will actually obtain a reduced nicotine content and tar content in cigarettes, and we will also obtain some rules on the additives that the industry has used to date. These are substances that have helped to make cigarettes even more habit-forming than they would be without these substances. In actual fact, it is quite incredible that this method of production has been accepted until now. It is good that we are going to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out the new labelling rules – the new rules on warnings on packets. I believe that the rules that we will now have will make it difficult for consumers of cigarettes – and new potential consumers of cigarettes – not to be aware that cigarettes are actually very harmful to health. It is also good that we will obtain some rules on the specific positive designations that it has been possible to use for cigarettes, such as ‘mild’ and ‘light’. This should have happened earlier, but it is good that there will now be rules. I believe that these types of designation are very misleading and give a false impression. They create a false sense of security among consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention exports. We have had a discussion concerning what I will call export hypocrisy in this matter. It cannot be right for us in the EU to sell cigarettes outside our own region that we believe are so damaging to health that they should not be used by our own citizens. There will be a transitional scheme for these exports. I do not think that this was necessary, but it was, of course, a political compromise. At any rate, we can be pleased that there is a time limit of a maximum of three years on this hypocrisy. I believe that, all in all, this is a good day for EU health policy, and one with which we can be very satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This piece of legislation will have a dramatic impact. It will transform the way in which cigarettes are sold in Scotland, the UK and the whole of the European Union. The directive will reduce the most addictive and dangerous substances in cigarettes; it will ban the use of misleading descriptors such as ‘ultras’, ‘lights’ and ‘milds’ and it will introduce giant health warnings.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the work of MEPs we have also been given a guarantee that the Commission will draw up new rules on the use of picture health warnings on cigarette packs by December 2002. After decades of deception and misinformation from the tobacco industry, the message about the true cost of smoking will finally start to hit home.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, smoking is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union. Over half a million people in the EU die needlessly each year from smoking. In fact, someone diagnosed with lung cancer has an average of between three to ten months of life left.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this month there is the World No Tobacco Day. There is no better way of celebrating this than by the coming into force of this new directive next year. At this point I should like to encourage colleagues to sign the written declaration for an EU No Tobacco Day.</p>
<p class="contents">However the battle against big tobacco continues. I look forward to the new proposals for a tobacco ad ban which the Commission will be introducing shortly. One life lost due to tobacco is one life too many. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, honourable Members, it is with great pleasure that I reply to this debate on the report of the Conciliation Committee concerning the tobacco products directive. This directive is the culmination of several years of hard work by the Commission on the basis of the best scientific advice.</p>
<p class="contents">We have developed and proposed a qualitative step forward in protecting public health, working within the confines of the legal basis for completion of the internal market. The directive before you today will represent a significant improvement on our current legislative position and fill many of the gaps, which have made the current rules ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">The present directive will put the European Community at the forefront of efforts to control the death and disease caused by tobacco consumption. In this way, the addiction of future generations of young people has been taken seriously, and a framework created to reduce the enormous harm caused by this product.</p>
<p class="contents">I need hardly remind Parliament of the level of health damage from tobacco to our population which exceeds that from more widely debated causes. The World Health Organisation estimates tobacco-related deaths in the Community to be more than half a million a year. This does not include the number of smokers who suffer from serious and debilitating illnesses, such as respiratory disease and heart disease. This makes tobacco control the most import tool in reducing death and disease in our midst.</p>
<p class="contents">I must here compliment Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whose amendments have substantially improved and completed this measure. The Commission was happy to accept many of these amendments. Mrs Maes, in her contribution to Parliament, made a statement that this was a textbook example of cooperation between the three great legislative institutions of the European Union; I would echo that, but refer also to the role of the Court of Justice in its judgment in the case relating to the advertising directive. I would go further and, say echoing what Mrs Maes has said about this being a textbook example, that this issue – the story of tobacco and the legislation of tobacco – both in the first advertising directive that I am bringing forward soon and this particular directive, is worthy of close examination by any serious student of the European Union or law student. It provides a clear example of how all the institutions can work well together in formulating policy and bringing forward that policy in the form of valuable legislation within the confines of the competences laid down in the treaties amending the Treaty of Rome, and will allay the fears of anybody who has concerns about the European institutions becoming too powerful, because the lines of demarcation are clearly set out by the Court and respected by the institutions in respect of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, this is a textbook example as Mrs Maes has said, worthy of further study by young students. This directive recasts several existing directives from the late 1980s. We have used this proposal to update and complete existing instruments on the basis of scientific developments, including, for the first time, several important harmonisation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the setting of a reduced tar ceiling in cigarettes and the creation for the first time of a ceiling for nicotine and carbon monoxide. These ceilings will directly attack the agents in cigarettes responsible for cancer, addiction and cardiovascular disease. We are not, however, aiming at producing a safe cigarette, since such a product cannot exist, but simply to reduce the most dangerous product constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">Importantly, these rules now apply to all imported products and to all products manufactured in the Community. Thus, we will not export products, which are considered inappropriate for our citizens. Equally, given the significant amount of smuggling, we do not run the risk of unsafe exports coming back onto the Community market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been particularly upset at the cynical efforts of the tobacco industry to use the spectre of job losses to threaten this measure. The same threats were also expressed when the original tobacco directives were adopted in the late 1980s. They were not true then and they are not true now. There is no room for double standards for our own citizens and for others when we are talking about an addictive and deadly product.</p>
<p class="contents">Another innovation in this text is to require the declaration of additives in tobacco products – potentially the most important single measure contained in this legislation. Currently we do not know what these additives are at Community level and, more importantly, why they are added to the product. Manufacturers and importers will in future be obliged to declare these constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">We will then move towards preparing a legislative proposal when these data are provided. This will be done before 31 December 2002. I am happy to say that preparations for this consequent legislation, arising from the furnishing of this data, will be undertaken during my mandate as a Commissioner. In the meantime, Member States remain free to protect their consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important component of this directive is the substantial increase in the size of health warnings on packaging. They will be increased to ensure that consumers are fully informed of the health risks they run and, for the first time, information will be provided on how to get help to stop smoking. The previous rules were worded too loosely and the new directive makes sure that the warnings will be printed in colours that are clearly readable and cannot be disguised as at present.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of an amendment from this House, the introduction of colour photos on warnings is to be introduced for the first time. This will greatly increase the impact of these warnings.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years research has shown the importance of avoiding misleading product descriptors on tobacco products which may make the consumer believe that a particular product is safer than another. This directive introduces a requirement not to use such misleading terms on tobacco products. As such, it aims to protect smokers and non-smokers alike from misleading representations of the dangers posed to them by such products.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to provide a mechanism to keep these rules up to date, we have also included a provision for regular Commission reports and a committee procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous declaration when the first reading took place, I undertook to consult with tobacco experts in drawing up this report and any subsequent proposals. I can inform you today that work is already under way to reconstitute the Commission's Advisory Committee on Cancer Prevention and to create its working group on tobacco. However, I must draw your attention to the difficulty the Commission envisages in respecting the deadline imposed in Article 5(3) of this text, which leaves little time to consult these committees and subsequently to adopt rules for the use of colour photographs on warnings.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, I also hope to meet my undertaking to present a new proposal on tobacco advertising and sponsorship. This will replace the directive annulled by the Court of Justice last October.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regard the Community's legislative activity as complementary to that under way in the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on tobacco control. I welcome the presence of an observer from the European Parliament in the Community delegation, appropriately Mr Maaten, which early this month met in Geneva when the second round of negotiations for this convention took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive and for the words expressed in respect of the Commission's involvement. I should like to play tribute in particular to Mr John Ryan and the significant contribution he has made to this issue over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope it will be seen in coming years that this directive is a keystone of our efforts to reduce the damage to health by smoking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
