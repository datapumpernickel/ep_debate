<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Herman </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last report I will be presenting to Parliament no doubt comes at a very unfortunate time of day, but at a very good time of the year. Why? Because it was just yesterday that Mr Prodi who – on this point at least – seems to have the backing of just about everyone, said that the European institutions must be thoroughly reformed. Well, so that Mr Prodi will not be alone in proposing these reforms, we have decided to help him and to submit to him a few ideas and guidelines which, thanks to the broad consensus within our committee, we have been able to propose to you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always necessary to amend the Treaties in order to improve the operation of the institutions. Experience shows that in the past we succeeded in perfecting and improving the operation of our institutions by means of institutional agreements or internal reforms. But as a rule each institution looks to its own affairs. We have rather broken this taboo by agreeing on this occasion to look at other institutions than our own. As we know, there is scope for Parliament to improve its operation too, and in fact it has a lot of work to do in this respect. However, in the light of recent developments we must look particularly closely at the workings of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bourlanges has already produced a report on the Council, adopted by the House not very long ago, which includes a series of suggestions designed to improve its functioning. So we will not come back to this, but will concern ourselves solely with the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, there is nothing new about the malfunctionings which have recently come to light. Their causes are both long‐standing and deep‐rooted. In particular, anything to do with staff recruitment, promotion and motivation has been affected by a growing renationalisation and politicisation which have produced an adverse effect on the functioning of a civil service that must be impartial and neutral. This phenomenon is well‐attested and has given rise to the present difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the Commission was initially conceived primarily in order to set up a legislative framework with a view to achieving harmonisation and not to manage programmes. The Commission"s culture, structure and tradition were therefore somewhat ill‐suited to the tasks with which it was subsequently charged and for which it was not granted the necessary resources, either by the Council or – if I may say so – by Parliament. I also believe the Commission made the mistake of accepting these missions. This is one of the reasons for the malfunctionings. The other is of course the role of the cabinets, which has become important. The increasing role of the cabinets no doubt explains why, as the wise men confirmed, certain Commissioners – I am not saying all of them – lost control over their administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission"s internal structure, the number of directorates‐general has been increased in order to give employment to a growing number of Commissioners. If we continue in this direction, as the number of Commissioners is to increase from 20 to 30, we will again be creating the same number of directorates‐general. This increase is not in the interests of internal coherence or homogeneous responsibilities and will produce disastrous results. We have already seen this with external relations, which are the responsibility of four directorates‐general.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Parliament is concerned, our proposals are clearly rather more delicate, as they are competing with those of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and require a consensus within this House, which is not always easy to obtain. But most of our proposals concern the Commission and take into account the diagnosis I have just offered, which I believe to be widely shared.</p>

We limited ourselves to just one subject about which we feel very strongly, namely the agencies. I must first extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur for the way in which he also looked at these agencies in his report. They are a subject that is sometimes overlooked, but both the committees of experts dealing with them and the Committee on Budgets have often expressed their amazement at what goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening with these agencies? As the rapporteur says, they fulfil an important role. They are neatly shared out among the various states. As the rapporteur rightly says, there are no current Member States which do not have agencies and we are convinced that new agencies will be found for the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem with the agencies is, I believe, that they are always able to obtain more staff than the Commission itself. What is the reason for this? The Committee on Budgets, Parliament the Council and the Commission itself like to give the impression that the agencies are not taking on extra staff. But the host countries want their agencies to be rather more extensive than was initially planned, so they want them to have extra staff. This means that the agencies can take on certain tasks that the Commission is no longer able deal with. How can this be solved? By as much uniformity as possible – not total uniformity, as we stated in our report and as the rapporteur accepted, but in any event enough uniformity to meet the same criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">These agencies must be closely monitored because if present trends continue we will reach the point where more people paid by the Union are employed by the agencies than by the Commission itself. I am very pleased that the rapporteur has sought to act on our report in this way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schäfer </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, never before in the history of European integration have so many important decisions been made and so many dramatic events taken place in such a short time as since 1 January. They range from the successful launch of the single currency and the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the resignation of the Commission and the ongoing accession process for 10 countries. All this has now been overshadowed by the armed conflict in Kosovo, in which the European Union and its Member States are involved. Never before has the EU been faced with greater challenges to its capacity for action and enlargement. That is why the Herman report contains both criticisms of the Commission"s structures and self‐criticism of our own procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important points are these: within the Commission there need to be clear portfolios and Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, similar to Ministers and Ministers of State in national governments. We need to strike a balance in this way between the principle of collective responsibility and the particular responsibilities of individual members of the Commission. After all, transparency is of paramount importance. The new Commission headed by Romano Prodi as its President will take a giant step towards European government, and it is vital that it should.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the European Parliament must concentrate on its prime tasks, which are legislation, legislation, and legislation again, together with the selection and scrutiny of the Commission and decision‐making on the budget. It should be possible to present and explain all these activities to the public. Today, we are learning from our past mistakes and preparing ourselves for new activities. That is the yardstick the public will apply, and public opinion should be our own yardstick.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, because this is Mr Herman"s last report, I would like to thank him on behalf of the Socialist Group for his twenty years of work, and in particular for his commitment, for his creativity and for everything he has achieved in the institutional field. The House is today considering the last report of – if I may take the liberty – a great European. We do not belong to the same political family, but we essentially have the same aims and the same principles, and I believe that we also have many of the same dreams. On behalf of my group, I would to express my esteem for Fernand Herman's life"s work.</p>

Your experience as a rapporteur and your very remarkable contribution to the European Union"s progress mean that this report will be an essential discussion document for the next Committee on Institutional Affairs. As Mr Schäfer has just pointed out, throughout your career you have indeed made a genuine contribution to the progress of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group"s first amendment is designed to strengthen paragraph 32 of the text by allowing the European Parliament to exercise its supervisory role to the full. As a result – and this is perhaps one of the things on which we were not in agreement, Mr Herman – it would no longer be necessary to refer to committees of wise men, one of the members of which has in any case shown little wisdom by making political statements which are scarcely in keeping with his position.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment, tabled in committee by Mr Corbett but not accepted by either the PSE or the PPE and subsequently rejected in committee, is designed to give the Commission President the power to replace a Commissioner when circumstances justify it. We believe this proposal to be in keeping with Declaration No 32, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that the President would be granted this responsibility in circumstances such as the present, thereby avoiding a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, Mr Herman – and as you yourself pointed out – your conclusions are fortunately very much in line with what Mr Prodi said yesterday about his plans for the Commission when he talked about strengthening the role of the President, efficiency, transparency and individual and collective responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would urge the European Parliament to take a long hard look at itself and to get down as soon as possible to the task of studying how it can become a more transparent organisation with, for example, fewer hegemonic pacts between the two major groups to the detriment of the openness we all advocate.</p>

I hope that this will be borne in mind by all those who believe the democratic deficit, the lack of supervision, the careless management and, last but not least, the rumoured profiteering at European level can be reduced by pumping in more powers and more resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the opposite must be the case. Experience teaches us that political administrations can only be effectively controlled and, more importantly, can only exercise effective self‐control when they are as close as possible to the people. In my opinion this must be the first application of the principle of subsidiarity which everyone here supports, or at least pays lip service to.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to improve the workings of the European Union and of all the European institutions we must apply the principle of subsidiarity in all areas both actively and consistently. In short, we can improve Europe through less Eurocratic powers and meddling, less Eurocratic red tape and less bureaucracy. That, at least in my opinion, is the basic way to cure institutions which are all, without exception – and it would be laughable for Parliament now to point the finger solely at the Commission – tainted with the image of being interfering, money guzzling and unproductive institutions, and I fear to a large extent justifiably so.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we now have before us contains many interesting proposals, but is nevertheless a typical example of the most blind Eurofederalist thinking, since it is concerned solely with treating the symptoms. To end with another saying, the proposed measures amount to no more than putting sticking plaster over the wounds.</p>

We can also change the way the European Parliament operates so as to make it the centre of political life in the European Union, in its role as a body directly elected by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the general and positive thrust of all these proposals. However, I have some reservations about certain particular aspects. I believe it is necessary to identify real portfolios for Commissioners, but I cannot understand why they should be reduced just when the Commission"s powers are being widened. Above all, I cannot accept the notion of creating two categories, that is senior and junior Commissioners on the model of full Ministers and Ministers of State, just when people are saying that the distribution of portfolios between Commissioners should not be a way of drawing a hierarchical distinction between small and large states. I am delighted that the rapporteur has accepted my proposal on that latter point, as this is an aspect I disagree with.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I feel that Mr Herman, perhaps because he is Belgian, is too centralist, or rather that he wants to concentrate the departments in Brussels and seems to rather distrust the EU agencies. I take the opposite view and believe that the agencies, which should be rationalised, are an effective way of bringing the public and the European Union closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me say this: the European Parliament will only reform itself – and I am at liberty to say this because I am not standing for re‐election either – if it does away with the absurd practice of voting in the plenary instead of discussing policy, which is what people expect from their elected representatives. It is my belief that Mr Herman"s proposals go in the right direction, as long as our successors have the political will to put a stop to this paralysing rotation between the two main groups and are capable of holding a political debate, or in other words to give a voice to the citizens of the European Union.</p>

He has given the very best of himself to the European Union and I should like to expressly thank him for this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) Mr President, the resolution on improving the functioning of the institutions without amending the Treaty is one of the building blocks which the European Parliament is putting into place in order to equip the European Union for the future. As has been said, it relates to the Commission, the agencies and Parliament itself. Both Mr Prodi, the candidate for Commission President, and the Council presidency will be able to put it to good use in preparing for the next intergovernmental conference which was announced this morning. I hope that the Commission"s Secretariat‐General and directors‐general will act on the recommendations, but I am not so sure that this will be the case, as their decision not to reappoint Mr Van Buitenen to his former position makes us fear the worst.</span></p>
<p class="contents">For its part, Parliament has responded to Mr Herman"s requests by approving the changes to the rules on voting and amendments. It will also be deciding on reducing the number of committees during this part‐session. If in future Parliament is more careful about assigning more and more tasks to the Commission, then it will be functioning in the spirit of Mr Herman"s proposal, to whom I should like to once again pay tribute.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that this report should form the foundation on which any subsequent work is based. The timetable ahead of us is unavoidable and it does not help the situation as the crisis in the Commission is still revealing serious problems and deficiencies requiring solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Treaty will enter into force in the next few weeks and the second report by the Group of Experts will not be completed for some months. Therefore, this report clearly cannot include every last detail of the improvements that will be required. But it has certainly tackled one issue: the serious problem facing the Commission in terms of the imbalance between, on the one hand, its responsibilities, its duties and the management of the programmes it is entrusted with, and on the other hand the resources it has available. This very serious problem had not been highlighted in any parliamentary report. But Mr Herman has tackled it very well and has put forward possible solutions. He may not have included all of the solutions required, but the ones he has mentioned will undoubtedly be necessary and they represent a very effective basis for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Mr Herman, the paragraphs relating to the need to simplify Parliament"s voting procedures are extremely important. I hope that they will be taken into account for everyone"s benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, and congratulations to Mr Herman.</p>

<p class="contents">We do indeed need more transparency, democracy and rigour for all our European institutions. For the Commission, first of all, about which a great deal is being said and a great many promises being made. All I will say is that I will wait until I see the merchandise before I pass judgement. But also for Parliament, which needs to concentrate more on getting to the heart of problems and stop trying to be all things to all men, which can sometimes look like pretend democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally and most importantly, we need transparency, democracy and rigour for the Council if one day it hopes to become a real government. But here I am perhaps straying beyond the Herman report and even the Bourlanges report and entering the realms of the future intergovernmental conference which I believe I heard announced this morning by the President‐in‐Office. If that is the case and it is confirmed, I very much welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, congratulations to Mr Herman, and our best wishes go with you.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, may I for my part congratulate Mr Herman on behalf of the Commission on his detailed and very creative report on what has most certainly become a crucial problem, namely the functioning of the institutions. Evidently the Commission need not comment further on this report and indeed may not comment on it as this is the task of the new President of a new Commission who will undoubtedly be very pleased to draw on the wealth of experience on which it is based. I am referring here to the experience of Mr Herman, who I believe is bidding farewell to the European Parliament with this report and this political testament. May I take this opportunity to thank him very sincerely on behalf of the Commission for his exceptionally energetic and creative work, including in cooperation with the Commission. We have always been very pleased with the way we have been able to cooperate closely and constructively with him.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as a rule, it is always a good thing to keep a keen eye on the functioning of the institutions, and especially when there are changes to the Treaty, as is now the case with Amsterdam. In these exceptional circumstances, following the crisis which the institutions in general and the Commission in particular have experienced, it is of the utmost importance for the Commission"s management function to be once again thoroughly scrutinised. I am speaking here from my own experience, but I am also very pleased to be able to refer to what this Commission – my colleagues and President Santer in particular – have set in train in order to improve that very area of the Commission"s functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to express the hope that the reforms within the Commission will strengthen rather than change, let alone upset, the existing institutional balance. I also hope that in future the Commission will continue to be the driving force it has traditionally sought to be, particularly for promoting further integration within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Herman will also approve when I take this opportunity today to wish the incoming president and his new team every success in reinvigorating the European Commission and restoring it to the sort of role that the people of the European Union also expect it to have. I would also add that even the present Commission clearly realises that the current crisis may also have its positive side in terms of strengthening the quality and substance of democracy in our institutions. So in this sense we can also accept the positive side to this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end here, Mr President, as, I repeat, in the present exceptional political circumstances it is unrealistic for the Commission to comment on this report. But I can say to Mr Herman that I have read the report and recognise in it a great deal which we at the Commission have also been getting to grips with in recent years. I am convinced that the new Commission will benefit from many of these recommendations.</p>
