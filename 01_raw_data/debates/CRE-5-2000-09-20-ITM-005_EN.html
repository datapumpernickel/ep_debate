<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I have no doubt that in the age of new communications technologies, in the age of the Internet, which is well under way at the beginning of this new century, we legislators are faced with a very exciting challenge: to protect people from intrusion and from attacks on their private life, their dignity or their reputation. The protection of these rights is recognised in numerous legislative texts of a universal nature, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of a transnational nature, such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties, or of a national nature, such as the constitutions of the Member States, but the legislative diversity in this area requires that efforts be made in terms of the harmonisation and unification of criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of countries are beginning a legislative process to prevent violations of people’s fundamental rights, such as the right to private life, and this right is also expressly included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are therefore facing a legislative challenge of unquestionable importance, which must regulate to ensure that this right is respected and the exceptions which, in a democratic society, it is necessary to establish in order, as the Convention of the Protection of Human Rights says, to safeguard public security, defend public order and prevent crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which I am presenting to Parliament aims to analyse one of the many aspects involved in this legislative task: the creation of a single secretariat for the three supervisory bodies for the protection of data from Europol, Schengen and customs information, within the framework of the third pillar and in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters enshrined in Chapter VI of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s proposal for a decision is correct but is, in my view, timid and does not go far enough. In this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives: transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that either objective is fully guaranteed in the Council’s proposal, hence the content of the amendments I am proposing, which have been accepted practically unanimously in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights. Justice and Home Affairs. I wonder whether it is a positive thing, in terms of transparency, to have three joint data protection bodies within the third pillar? I believe not. I therefore believe that the final objective should be the establishment of a single body corresponding to a single legal framework within the European Union and that that body be provided with its own budget and staff, even exceeding the normal distribution between pillars, taking advantage of the option provided for in Article 42 of the Treaty of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament is currently examining and debating the consequences for personal and economic relations in the European Union of the discovery of a possible spying network known as the Echelon system, and is also studying a regulation on the protection of physical persons in the processing of data by the institutions of the Community. We are furthermore now examining this proposal for the third pillar. As we will see, these are different aspects of the same problem. I therefore believe that this Parliament must go further than the Council’s decision, which, as I have said, falls short on aspects such as the election and appointment of the secretariat, its dismissal or the guarantee of professional secrecy in its functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Independence is another basic element which is not sufficiently guaranteed in the Council’s proposal. Parliament is the institution which must guarantee its independence, by means of the democratic control which legitimately corresponds to it. That is why in the future the body should be appointed by Parliament and the secretariat of the three bodies would enjoy more independence if the costs of staffing and the resources needed for its funding were to be included in section 8B of the general European Union budget, as I propose, and not in the Council’s budget. Let us not fool ourselves, financial independence is essential to guaranteeing functional independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are legislating in a field which is fundamental to the future of our interpersonal, economic and commercial relations. Our challenge is to create a balance and compatibility between the right to privacy and the right of free access to information. The introduction of new technologies, computers and telecommunications has broken down barriers and transcended borders. There has been a genuine revolution in commercial, social and personal relations which have a real effect on the daily lives of citizens: health, advertising, banking transactions, or even aspects which relate to the security and defence of citizens, and of States themselves, can be jeopardised if there are no rules to guarantee the correct transmission and storage of the data which today circulate with total freedom and which are not immune to the serious danger of indiscriminate use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a small step forward, but one which signals the beginnings of a strategy for harmonisation which, we hope, will be enacted under the third pillar. We are thus beginning to move towards harmonisation, with the creation of a joint secretariat for the various supervisory bodies. We hope that a set of common regulations for supervision and for a single supervisory body can be adopted in the medium term. This is crucial if we are to guarantee that the public’s fundamental right to privacy is respected, safeguarding the legal principle of fair and equal treatment for all citizens. Laws must be applied and interpreted according to the same criteria, providing the same level of data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, there is no justification for the existence of three separate joint supervisory bodies. Today, in addition to national supervisory bodies, there are also these three joint supervisory bodies, each with its own secretariat. The question is: can this system really guarantee effective protection? I do not think it can. These bodies therefore need to be merged into one single entity as soon as possible, with legal personality and its own budget, which will ensure that it is impartial and independent from the other institutions, as Mr Hernández Mollar has just said, and he is quite right. This is a matter of protecting the interests and rights of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a vital need to create a single legal framework in the European Union to provide citizens with sufficient guarantees, essentially by preventing the improper use or dissemination of personal data and by remedying the shortcomings in the current system of protection. The constitutions in force in the various Member States recognise the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Union’s draft Charter of Fundamental Rights also expressly upholds every citizen’s right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. The very fact that different laws exist in each country, however, raises various problems that can be overcome by adopting minimum standards which will make it possible to harmonise these national laws, thereby guaranteeing that citizens’ fundamental rights are respected, and specifically the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression and of information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sousa Pinto (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly complex nature of society and of economic life, backed up by ever more powerful technology, is creating new situations which threaten the individual rights of our citizens and leave them unprotected. This requires us to establish appropriate mechanisms for protecting our citizens from potential abuses of these rights. The current system, which is designed to protect people’s privacy and which guarantees all citizens’ inalienable right to privacy with regard to the computerised processing of their personal data, is widely considered to be inefficient. This is because in addition to national data protection supervisory bodies there are still three joint supervisory bodies in the European Union, each with its own secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat this duplication of supervisory bodies, which leads to inefficiency, the Portuguese have drawn up an initiative for a proposal with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision to create a single secretariat for the three joint data protection supervisory bodies. In the current circumstances, it is generally accepted that this is a viable solution which would reduce the problems caused by the existence of three data protection supervisory bodies within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s suggestion that a single data protection supervisory body should be created, with a single secretariat, with legal personality and its own budget is also to be welcomed. This would create ideal conditions for achieving our stated aims of protecting our citizens' private life and individual freedoms, without, on the other hand, impeding the free flow of information, which is the hallmark of modern societies. The rapporteur recognises that it is not feasible to set up this single body in the European Union in the short term, and refers in his report to establishing it in the medium term, under the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, I should also like to draw your attention to the risk of postponing the creation of this authority for years and years. It might have been wiser for the report to have set a fixed and reasonable deadline for this body to be established, which would give more force to the proposal put forward by the rapporteur and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are serious problems with the EUROPOL and Schengen Conventions, and as regards customs cooperation. One of these is the inadequate level of protection for data collated and processed in the institutions. As far as I am concerned, it goes without saying that the proposed secretariat must be independent of the institutions requiring monitoring, as is borne out by the fact that it has its own budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet still I cannot vote in favour of Mr Hernández Mollar’s report. I ask myself this: why should bringing all those who have been responsible for data protection hitherto, together in one secretariat headed by one General Secretary, lead to improvements in data protection merely because it is certain to lead to savings in this sphere? Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection. Taking an overall political view, I see Portugal’s initiative, together with the report, as being one more step along the way towards improving coordination between Schengen and EUROPOL.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the problems associated with the aforesaid conventions, inadequate data protection is the least of our worries. Both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe. Fundamental human rights such as the right to freedom of movement, the right to asylum, or in many cases, even the simple right to human dignity, will be compromised, and these institutions will support and control this. Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of an initiative that may bring about a mild improvement, when it will also help legitimise these institutions as a result. Since I am basically critical of EUROPOL, and Schengen in general, and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection, I intend to abstain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the EU, extensive registers of personal data are now being compiled in which very sensitive personal information is stored. At the same time, it is obvious that these registers are inadequately supervised and insufficiently secure.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are obviously keen to improve data protection and supervision. We therefore support the idea of introducing a single independent supervisory authority with proper powers and resources. To that extent, we are in favour of the basic ideas in this report but we wish, however, to point out that it is important to construct this supervisory authority on the basis of the skills possessed by the Member States in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">A new supervisory authority must be able to cover all the relevant registers, including the Eurodac register which has a major role to play in the EU’s asylum policy. Refugees are an especially vulnerable group, and information contained on a register can be a direct reason for deporting people and so have serious consequences for an asylum seeker. It is therefore especially important to be able to see to it that the register contains accurate information, that the asylum seeker is provided with information about his or her rights and that there are opportunities for appeal. Moreover, the Sirene organisation established under the Schengen agreement must be covered by a new supervisory authority. By and large, the relatively little known Sirene can send any personal data at all between Member States at short notice, as well as combine data relating to ordinary police matters with that concerning state security and policy on refugees. The whole of the Sirene organisation suffers from a palpable lack of public and parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have significant experience in this area when it comes to dealing with the Schengen agreement’s large register of personal data, SIS. That experience is unfortunately very disheartening. The Joint Supervisory Authority, or JSA, has had quite inadequate resources. Moreover, it has been denied access to important information in SIS. This may be seen from the JSA’s first annual reports. In spite of the difficult working conditions, the JSA reveals serious deficiencies in SIS, for example incorrect information on file, instances of Member States’ illegally copying information and inadequate procedures for gaining access to registers. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to obtain effective data protection, more than effective supervision is required. More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers. One requirement is that registers of criminals be distinguished from registers of refugees and registers kept to protect state security. These different areas must <span class="italic">not</span> be covered by joint organisations and registers. Public and parliamentary control must be reinforced, especially when it comes to Sirene and Schengen. Moreover, clear limits must be set for what may be recorded in Europol’s investigation register, founded upon Article 10.1 of the Europol Convention. At present, the scope of the register goes far beyond what is necessary. People who are not suspected of crimes may be registered, and sensitive personal data about political views, religious affiliation and sexual orientation may be recorded. That is unreasonable. A central place must be given to personal privacy and legal rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In matters of data protection we have to make the difficult compromise between the protection of privacy, the safety of our citizens, and the stability of the Single Market. A basic pre-condition of a market in a Europe with no internal borders is that information flows unhindered and fast. As the visible supervision of the movement of goods and services has come to an end, the importance of so-called invisible supervision has grown year after year. The rapid exchange of information between official bodies is the only chance we have of preventing criminal exploitation of the benefits of this free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of data protection in today’s bit streams is still not adequate in the European Union. The fundamental human right of confidentiality as far as mail is concerned is being jeopardised, for example through criminal activity and inquiries carried out using email systems. The rapid growth in <span class="italic">e</span>commerce in particular is posing new threats to the protection of data concerning our citizens. For example, the theft of credit card information and the abuse of personal ID are growing dramatically in the information networks. In addition, databases established for purposes of marketing, which contain details of people’s way of life and consumer habits, are often in conflict with basic rights which are there to protect privacy. It is reasonable to suppose that the work of the various data protection bodies working now in the EU area can be made more effective through centralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The founding of a joint body with respect to the work of Europol, customs control and the ordinary fundamental rights of EU citizens is an excellent idea. At the same time, however, we must ensure that there are adequate resources available. The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate. And one must clarify ways of making data protection cooperation more effective between the Secretariat to be created and the national authorities. The independence of data protection bodies is the key to success here. Supervision always leads to difficult interpretations of a situation, the outcome of which many players may well wish to influence, owing to purely financial interests. Because of this, the bodies will have to work in close cooperation with the EU and national courts of justice. The European Parliament must monitor closely the work and accountability of the official Secretariat to be set up from a position of impartiality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, the Commission wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar, for the excellent report that he has presented and acknowledge that our participation in this debate has been made easier by the fact that we broadly agree with and support the approach he has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased with the initiative that has been taken by the Portuguese Government, as we feel that it will contribute to our efforts to rationalise, in a sensible way, the administrative support provided to the bodies responsible for supervising and guaranteeing data protection established by the Europol Convention, the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the rapporteur’s view that a single supervisory body needs to be created for these three instruments, because a single supervisory body would ensure that the principles of data protection are applied more coherently, both under the Schengen Convention and the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes. The creation of a single supervisory body would also prevent an undesirable duplication of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission agrees with the idea that a range of common essential principles on data protection needs to be established and can be implemented as uniformly as possible throughout the third pillar. It is true that there are currently shortcomings in the Community legal framework in this area. We are pleased that a specialist Council Group has initiated the debate on these common general principles and also that the French Presidency has already made it clear that this issue is one of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that this is not an easy task, not only because of the sophistication of the technology, but also because it is particularly important for us to find a solution that strikes a balance between safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms on the one hand and on the other, having the instruments needed to ensure that the democratic rule of law is respected and that we can effectively fight transnational and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel sure that our first task must be to define these common principles, which can then be translated into the various legislative instruments that we will need to adopt in the coming years under the third pillar. This approach also involves – as various speakers have already pointed out – introducing, either under the Europol Convention or under new laws based on the Schengen Convention, clear and transparent principles of democratic and judicial supervision, which will guarantee the fundamental values on which a Union governed by the rule of law must be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most difficult issue that this report raises is the problem of deciding whether a separate budget heading should be created for the joint secretariat. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur’s assertion that it is extremely important to guarantee the independence of this secretariat in relation to the Council itself. The idea that we are therefore advocating, even if this issue can potentially only be resolved in the long term, is to create a separate budget heading. Nevertheless, we understand that for the moment, the Council’s prime concern is that the creation of a new budget heading could cause delays in setting up a joint secretariat. So in practical terms the Commission understands the Council’s desire to use existing financial structures, but only as a provisional measure. In the event that the Council decides to uphold its position, the Commission will back Mr Hernández Mollar’s proposal, which is to reiterate the recitals put forward by the rapporteur so as to make it quite clear that these are merely provisional financial arrangements pending the creation of a single supervisory body responsible for data protection under the three conventions. To conclude, I am delighted that this report and its underlying principles have received such widespread support in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
