<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, allow me to begin with a brief flashback. Five years ago almost to the day, on 2 December 1998, this House held a heated debate here in Brussels with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Santer. With hindsight, this debate marked the beginning of the end of the former Commission. The issue then, as it is now, was combating fraud and the conclusions that the Commission needed to draw from several serious cases. At the time, the President of the Commission decided to head for a confrontation with Parliament. Against the declared will of this House, he wanted to move most of the responsibility for fighting fraud out of the Commission and into an external agency, on the grounds that this was the only way to guarantee the independence of investigations. We rejected this very firmly, because no one was able to tell us where this agency was supposed to derive its authority from and how the effectiveness of its work was supposed to be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">This fantasy of an external agency has resurfaced in recent months in connection with the debate on the Eurostat case, thankfully, it seems, at least only in the minds of a handful of senior officials in the Commission. The signals that we received from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, in Strasbourg in November pointed in another, more constructive direction. Today, a good five months before the Members of this House bid one another a final farewell and head for the campaign trail, it is a question of identifying what is feasible and tackling this together, so that on such a decisive issue as protecting the Union’s financial interests we do not have to go before our electorate empty-handed.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the individual points. My report makes it very clear that our prime concern is that OLAF is underperforming, something that was brought to light very dramatically by the Eurostat case. This is not the time to apportion blame, but if we note that of the 300 staff in OLAF fewer than 15, even on a generous count, are at present working on internal investigations in the institutions, then something has gone seriously wrong. If that is the case then this office is, to put it inelegantly, completely off the mark. A quick and radical change of course is required here. OLAF needs to focus its investigations on those areas in which the relevant bodies in the Member States either cannot or do not wish to intervene, that is on investigations within the institutions and on the expenditure that is managed directly by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is respect for the fundamental rights of those involved in investigations. The OLAF Regulation is absolutely clear on this. I quote: ‘These investigations must be conducted … with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value.’ We take it from the reports and opinions of the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but also from the Ombudsman’s reports, that this is where the greatest danger currently lies. In this respect, the regulation is quite simply being ignored by the Office’s investigators. I only have to remind you of the most recent example, the reprimand issued by the Ombudsman last week against OLAF in connection with the libelling of a journalist in public statements made by the Office. If the fundamental freedoms of those concerned are not respected then at the end of the day the results of the investigations are also worthless, and I fear that, as a result, OLAF still has some nasty surprises in store in connection with Eurostat. What is lacking is an effective and above all preventive monitoring mechanism to enforce the provisions of the regulation. This is an area where we need to take countermeasures by amending the regulation itself. We do not wish to touch the Director’s decision-making powers, but we need a stronger counterbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">This counterbalance is the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but on three conditions: firstly, that the amendment concerned explicitly confers upon it the power to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and rights of those involved in investigations are respected; secondly, that it receives the additional resources to enable it to carry out this task, and thirdly, last but not least, that it has greater independence from the Director of OLAF, not only by increasing the number of staff in the Committee’s secretariat, but also by removing it from the organisational framework of both OLAF and the Commission. Targeting resources on investigative activities and stepping up the monitoring of these investigative activities are the key points that now need to be addressed where OLAF is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have done our work well in the committee. We are fulfilling our responsibilities to our electorate and to the Union’s taxpayers. I therefore commend this report to the House.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Bösch, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was, as you mentioned, established in 1999. This office became the focus for most of the Commission’s work to fight against fraud and OLAF was given the task and the right to carry out investigations in any of the European institutions if fraud was suspected. OLAF was entrusted with extensive responsibilities and, as the latest OLAF activity report shows, it has already notched up clear successes in many areas. OLAF carries out its administrative investigations, whether internal or external, completely independently, even though the office is established within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This dual status has raised both problems and questions, as can be seen from the report that we are debating today. At issue in today’s debate is the Bösch report on the Commission’s so-called Article 15 report. This sounds very technical, but it is a tremendously important debate, because it is about the future of OLAF, which, let us not forget, is still a very young office.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his hard work. The evaluation of OLAF’s activities over the last three years, which is the subject of the report, has been largely eclipsed by the Eurostat affair. Nevertheless, the findings and analyses in the report are essentially still valid, even though the views of the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, differ from our own in many respects. It is true, however, that the Eurostat affair did highlight existing shortcomings, in particular the question of communication between OLAF and the Commission, and OLAF’s legal framework, which was adopted in record time in 1999, needs to be adjusted accordingly. This does not mean, however – and here the Commission agrees with the rapporteur – that we need to go back to square one. At the present time, this would not appear to be either proper or realistic. In any case, greater changes are in the offing for OLAF, at the latest once we achieve our aim of setting up a European financial prosecution service. The Commission is continuing to lobby very vigorously for the European financial prosecution service to be enshrined in the new constitution, and we then propose to table a White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to your report. In it, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises various aspects of OLAF’s work, in particular its investigative activities and its priorities. Although I understand the rapporteur’s displeasure, I do not think that the criticism is entirely fair on all counts. OLAF has a difficult transitional period behind it. It would be wrong to view and assess OLAF through the Eurostat lens alone and not to include other essential work in the evaluation, whether it be in customs or cooperating with the enlargement countries to fight fraud – a very important field – or in the legislative area.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the criticism from the Committee on Budgetary Control, I do not think that Parliament’s and the Commission’s positions are actually all that far apart. What we all want is a proportionate reform of OLAF, that can be dealt with if possible in this parliamentary session. This is a starting point for us to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">On 18 November, President Prodi outlined the essential features of the proposed improvements in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I take it from your speech, Mr Bösch, that you too would agree with their general thrust. The Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control agree that OLAF should concentrate more on its core activities. I should, however, also like to scotch the rumours that could be heard after the President of the Commission had made his speech, namely that if Commission officials were suspected of fraud the Commission wanted to take control of the internal investigations away from OLAF. Let me be quite clear: this is not true. Instead, we need to consider whether tasks that are not closely related to OLAF’s specific area of expertise should be moved back to the sectoral directorates-general. This might apply, in my opinion, to clearance of accounts in agricultural policy for example. In addition, however, the boundaries between OLAF and other entities with investigative powers, in particular IDOC, need to be more clearly defined. Moreover, it should also be stated clearly in the regulation itself that it is the Director of OLAF who decides whether or not to open an investigation, that it is the discretionary principle that applies. This too will contribute to ensuring that the office concentrates on its true priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The information flow between OLAF and the institutions needs to be improved considerably. The Eurostat affair exposed the existing weaknesses in the channels of communication. Even when investigations are ongoing, the Commission must be able to take precautionary measures to protect the Community’s financial interests, obviously without jeopardising OLAF’s investigations. The draft memorandum of understanding between the Commission and OLAF is, in our view, an important and opportune step forward. However, in the interests of legal security and clarity the OLAF Regulation should also be clarified accordingly and we will obviously also discuss where such clarifications should be introduced and what form they should take.</p>
<p class="contents">An important and completely undisputed point is also strengthening the rights of defence of those who are involved in investigations. The OLAF Manual already contains a whole series of detailed internal rules about this. The main principles underlying the rights of the people concerned, such as their right to inspect files and to be given a hearing, should however be spelt out in the regulation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In his speech of 18 November, President Prodi mentioned enhancing the role of the Supervisory Committee or creating an interinstitutional forum as possible ways of improving OLAF’s governance. The Commission has not yet concluded its reflections on this. However, I can say that on the whole strengthening the Supervisory Committee, as proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is something with which we can agree, particularly when it comes to examining complaints. The Supervisory Committee itself has of course made an interesting proposal on this in its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, however, accept the rapporteur’s proposal to make the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee part of the European Parliament’s secretariat. The proposal raises fundamental questions of interinstitutional balance and also legal issues. The question of where the secretariat should be located needs to be given thorough consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can the Commission support the other proposals on OLAF’s budgetary status or on the control mechanism within the Commission, because they would call into question key aspects of the reform of our financial management. I might also remind you that, following the intensive work of Parliament and the Council, the new Financial Regulation only entered into force on 1 January of this year. We first need to gain experience with this new legislation. In any case, it is too early to make significant changes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now a question of acting swiftly – the Commission fully agrees with you here – and of tabling a legislative proposal that has a real chance of being dealt with in this Parliament. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to do so before the end of this year, as the Committee on Budgetary Control suggests in its report, and I would ask for your understanding in the light of the complex and sensitive nature of the subject. However, the Commission is confident that it will be able to table a legislative proposal very quickly at the beginning of next year. We should work on this together. We will take account of your report and the opinions of the Supervisory Committee in our work and considerations. The Commission is prepared to cooperate extensively with Parliament and, in the interests of effective fraud prevention in the European Union, our joint overriding objective should be to create a solid and workable basis for OLAF’s future work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its efforts to shed light on the Eurostat affair – its secret bank accounts, mis-management and nepotism – the Committee on Budgetary Control also uncovered significant shortcomings within OLAF. In this case, OLAF’s main failing was to work too slowly. In so doing it missed the opportunity to recover a considerable proportion of the at least EUR 8 million that had been embezzled. I believe, however, that the report adequately reflects the various criticisms of OLAF’s work. One thing must surely be clear to all of us, and it is clear: the real guilty party in this more than dramatic case of fraud is not OLAF but the Commission. They hushed it up and issued denials for so long that they had no choice but to continue doing so. And the Commissioners responsible, including the President of the Commission, are still refusing to accept the political, as well as the actual, responsibility for this embezzlement. On top of this, the Commission tabled its report – this Article 15 report – more than one year late. That is not very respectful of the law either, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Eurostat showed above all how necessary it is to have an anti-fraud office, if the Prodian zero tolerance of fraud is not to mutate into full tolerance of fraud. We want an independent OLAF and we continue to need a strong OLAF Supervisory Committee, made up of external experts. An independent OLAF is still far from being a reality, because unfortunately the Commission repeatedly manages to exert influence because of its links to OLAF in terms of organisation and staffing. The Commission’s attempt to take internal investigations away from OLAF, which only recently came to light, is a perfect example.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, that was not a rumour, as you have just claimed; a meeting really did take place. If your top officials did not inform you of it then I can give you sight of the minutes of that meeting. The Commission has an inexhaustible wealth of ideas in this respect, with which it now even appears to want to honour the OLAF Supervisory Committee. So far it has tended to be seen as a nuisance, but now, so we hear from the Commission, representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are to be involved to make it more democratic. This would, however, only serve to undermine OLAF’s independence further and we will certainly not be accompanying you down this precarious route, Commissioner. OLAF’s work will also continue to be difficult. We are aware of this. That is why, alongside strong, unswayable managers, we also need clear framework conditions. There is still a long way to go before we have a European financial prosecution service, but I hope that there will be no turning back. I am not able to support most of the amendments tabled by the Liberals and Greens, with two exceptions, but we can go along with most of the PSE’s amendments and I would ask for your support for our ten amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This body has grown so much that it now has 364 members of staff. The time for expectations, transitions and adjustment is, therefore, over. The time has definitely come for a balance sheet, for an evaluation and for accountability. The audit that has been planned for OLAF is crucial, as is moving from the current ‘Supervisory Committee’, which is simply a figurehead, to a monitoring, evaluation and decision-making body with ultimate authority. Our Committee on Budgetary Control has always viewed OLAF as a working instrument for a European Prosecution Service, an institution made increasingly necessary by the growth and sophistication of transnational European crime. The outcome of the current Intergovernmental Conference will consequently be crucial. We must ask ourselves whether, until OLAF is given the status of a European Prosecution Service, it makes sense to continue investing in police action that this organisation cannot legally pursue and instead employ auditing methods that are used in all financial crime-fighting and which no financial investigation body can do without.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly contributing to OLAF’s poor performance in the recent Eurostat case was a lack of understanding of basic concepts of communication and information, and an imbalance between the interests in play. Another contributing factor was the lack of auditors, whose skills must always be at the heart of combating financial fraud or irregularities. This is a time for rigour, strictness, hard work, professionalism, balance, reason and common sense and this is precisely what we hope to see OLAF achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports a strong, independent OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, I am also of the opinion that reform of OLAF is needed – reform that should focus on the following matters: the whole issue of OLAF’s independence and the fact that OLAF must prioritise its tasks to a greater extent and concentrate its resources on its core task, which is to clear up cases involving fraud and irregularities. The time taken to deal with cases must be reduced, and the channels of communication between the Commission and the Commissioners responsible must be improved. In the interests of the division of responsibilities and of the possibility of cutting losses, it is crucial that the Director-General and Commissioner responsible are notified as soon – and in as much detail – as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch has done sterling work in this House in relation to OLAF over a long period. Nevertheless, in our opinion, this report does not quite measure up to our aims. I do not think that it is Parliament’s business to determine OLAF’s internal organisation and staff policy. Nor do I think that it is right to bring the OLAF Supervisory Committee under the European Parliament. It must be fully independent of all the institutions. Nor do I think that it is necessarily a particularly good idea to give us a special legal officer for the rights of the individual. The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombudsman. Finally, I also think that it is important that this report be about OLAF. Other things should be dealt with separately. An example is the proposal regarding the Commission’s accountant in paragraph 16.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my regret once again that our committee has not had a proper opportunity to debate extensive amendments to the original text of this report, and I should like to call for Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the ELDR Group, so that we, too, can support, or vote in favour of, the final report during the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a great deal of criticism of OLAF of late, and rightly so, but OLAF must not be made a scapegoat for the Eurostat case, for example. The Commission must not use OLAF as a dustbin for all the cases it does not feel like dealing with itself. Even if a case has been forwarded to OLAF, that does not release the Commission from its obligation to act. OLAF must be fully independent, and we must admit that we were wrong to set OLAF up as an administrative part of the Commission. The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee must be fully independent of the Commission. The staff working for OLAF must be independent of all the institutions, and it is important that staff are not allowed to apply for posts in the Commission afterwards, because we have of course seen examples of cases being shelved because people had to go back to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I telephoned OLAF about Eurostat in the spring of 2002, after Dorte Schmidt-Brown had contacted me for the first time. OLAF told me that it had neither the time, the inclination nor the staff to look over the Eurostat case. In their words, Dorte Schmidt-Brown was a hysterical woman who should try to relax a little. It was not until Parliament became vociferous on the subject that the investigations picked up speed. It is very worrying that OLAF only prioritises investigations that have the interest of Parliament or the press, and it is also very worrying that OLAF does not take whistle-blowers seriously. I hope that we do not see any more of this kind of case. It is absolutely crucial that we are able to rely on OLAF’s objectivity, and that people work quickly and effectively in the future, but I should also say that OLAF is not known for being the sharpest tool in the box. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this occasion, unfortunately, we are unable to support him on all points, and we regret that there was not enough time left for a discussion of the individual amendments before the vote in committee. We identify two main problems with the amendments. Firstly, we are in favour of strengthening the Supervisory Committee, but we are also against the Supervisory Committee then being allocated to the European Parliament. If a Supervisory Committee is to be genuinely independent in its evaluations, it should be independent of Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we can perceive another tendency in the current debate about the Supervisory Committee. It is extremely regrettable that there is still no European Public Prosecutor at present and that we will probably have to wait some time for this. However, we should not now make the mistake of trying to achieve a transitional solution which pushes the Supervisory Committee vicariously into this role, as this would not be the appropriate role. What we need, in the long term, is judicial control of OLAF, but this can only be provided by the European Public Prosecutor, not by a substitute committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We take an equally critical view of another problem. We see that Parliament is increasingly seeking to involve itself in OLAF’s internal affairs, and we do not think this is right. We take the view that OLAF must be – and must remain – genuinely independent, but this does not mean that its independence from the Commission is necessarily strengthened if this House gets involved in micromanaging OLAF at the same time. That is quite wrong, in our view. Genuine independence also means administrative independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I think we need a thorough rethink of the amendments. I hope that we can achieve a compromise that a majority in the committee can support. I would also, however, like to make one thing clear to Mrs Stauner. We will not support most of your amendments, for we think it wrong that they should contain an implicit vote of no confidence in OLAF and apportion blame – also in a one-sided way – as regards the Commission’s role in the Eurostat affair. This is something we will not go along with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could of course be said that the advisability of Parliament giving such detailed rules for the reform of OLAF is doubtful, but, as the Commission has been unable to create a functioning monitoring body, Parliament must of course attend to it. It is we who must be answerable to citizens in the last instance for the way in which their money is managed. In the past, we had UCLAF, but that did not function perfectly. Then OLAF came along, and obviously we are now seeing that that has not improved matters as desired.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the criticism, in itself, that several of my fellow Members have made regarding the causes of OLAF’s inability to function. In the late seventies, there was a joke in my country stemming from the fact that there was a main post office that did not function properly. We were discussing what to do if a nuclear power station were built. There was a problem with the waste, and the joke was that the solution was to package the waste up and send it to the main post office, where it would go round and round in an eternal cycle until the radiation had diminished. The Commission has actually used OLAF in a similar way. Things have gone on far too long, have lain unattended for too long, and it is incomprehensible to us, especially in relation to the Eurostat case, that OLAF’s management was able to say to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in deadly earnest, that cases have been kept secret from the Commission so as not to burden the Commission with the unpleasant knowledge of what has happened. This gives a very amateurish impression. In fact, it could of course be life-threatening to the Commission not to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not really believe that it would be very helpful to put new committees above the existing Supervisory Committee, nor do we have much faith in the idea of a European Public Prosecutor. Indeed, what is important is to bring about a sea change in our approach towards dealing with the EU’s economy as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fraudulent practices surrounding the Eurostat affair illustrated that OLAF should no longer, administratively speaking, fall within the Commission's remit. The bureau must be given as much independence as possible and be made accountable to Parliament.</p>

Of course, we could have voted on its outcomes and possible implementation at an earlier stage if the Commission had submitted its evaluation of OLAF’s three years of work on time, as envisaged in the Regulation, instead of over nine months late. Some of the mismanagement and irregularities could then have been addressed more effectively than is possible now, at the end of the parliamentary term and the Commission’s term in office. Eurostat is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the background to OLAF’s establishment: an interim structure was all that could be achieved because a Treaty amendment was not envisaged at that stage. As a result, OLAF was in a paradoxical position from the outset. In its work, it is independent – we insist on that – but it is subordinate to the Commission administration in organisational terms. Nonetheless, delays, cumbersome processes and inadequate application of the OLAF Regulation by both parties – the Commission and OLAF – have regrettably characterised this agency to date. Let me cite just a few examples: its protracted recruitment process, its excessively long investigations, its failure to inform the Supervisory Committee as required, and above all the poor training and the failure to adequately respect the defence rights of the individuals under investigation. I take the Supervisory Committee’s clear statement on this latter point especially seriously, as it directly highlights the need to create a European Public Prosecutor to protect the Union’s financial interests. This House has called for such an appointment for a very long time and the Commission has now added its voice to these calls in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference. I am grateful to President Prodi for now having addressed this issue in his action plan. The fundamental rights of the individual can only be guaranteed within a judicial framework based on the rule of law. Until this objective is achieved, I fully support strengthening the Supervisory Committee, both as regards the Secretariat – we need to discuss its allocation to the European Parliament budget – and also, and especially, the appointment of highly qualified, independent persons as members of the Supervisory Committee. In sum, what we need is not a new regulation but a number of amendments, as the report makes clear. We need a strong OLAF. I ask the Commission to take our demands seriously so that we can move closer to a zero tolerance policy.</p>

A plea to Commissioner Schreyer: I urge you not to try to play down the Eurostat case which remains one of the most alarming and awkward episodes that the European Parliament has ever faced. The enormous economic damage caused has not and may never be quantified.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move onto the report. If what Mr Bösch wrote in the report were to be implemented, then we would live very peacefully in Europe. Financial interests would hardly be protected; legality would be the key element in all European issues. If, however, the established principles, which are summarised in Recital G, which state, and I quote, that ‘the Commission committed itself to a ‘zero tolerance’ policy with regard to fraud and irregularities’, are not translated in practice, then everything that is written will not make the immense effort poured by the rapporteur into his report worthwhile and no specific objective will be achieved. Now, given what has come to light on Eurostat, would it not have been more appropriate to put an amendment tabled by myself to the vote in committee – although, I am glad to say, Mr Bösch explained this issue – which reads, and I quote: ‘Can only condemn all the cases in which OLAF has been unable to conclude its investigations within the allotted 9-month time limit, in particular the Eurostat case, which has been suspended for over three years and in respect of which a timely investigation could have broken a chain of events which has now been exposed as anything but straightforward and of which certain elements are under investigation by the judicial authorities’? This amendment will be put to the vote and, I hope, adopted tomorrow in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I do not want what I have said about OLAF to be misinterpreted, for it cannot become a scapegoat for fraud perpetrated by others. This is why OLAF must be able to continue to receive its funding, which must be sufficient to strengthen the staff, in particular the investigation officials. I completely agree with the rapporteur in Article 33(1), when he calls on OLAF to inform the European Parliament in detail if an investigation takes longer than the prescribed nine months.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the Eurostat case, which disturbs and irritates many of us, I feel I can say that I certainly agree that our positions should be cautious, but, at the same time, we cannot accept an arrangement, which would mean that it would be seen as counterproductive to place the European Institutions in jeopardy over this case. We should be discussing and debating something else: in the Eurostat affair, were the contracts concluded properly or did fraud come to light?</p>
<p class="contents">If, as would seem the case from reading the reports, many contracts were concluded without lawful signatories, if there were conflicts of interest that led to certain, illegal economic benefits, if documents were systematically lost that should have been subject to control and news published outside that was intended solely to facilitate negotiations, if more than 50% of contracts were concluded with a single bid, then, clearly, damage running into millions of euro has been done to the European Community and this aspect must override everything else, including the preservation of the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is certainly no doubt that the Eurostat affair is not merely about gross misconduct at Eurostat – and I refrain from using the term ‘fraud’ simply because the matter is still under judicial investigation and I do not want to be accused of making prejudicial comments. Mistakes were also made in the Commission, and OLAF should have carried out the investigations more swiftly. This is why Mr Prodi has also devised an action plan which, on the one hand, contains comprehensive measures regarding Eurostat and, on the other hand, addresses the issue of communication between the departments and the Commissioners, as well as measures relating to OLAF. Let me say again to Mrs Stauner: the measures relating to OLAF do not include shifting the internal investigations into Commission officials back to the Commission. On the contrary – and let me quote from Mr Prodi’s speech – the aim is strengthening OLAF’s operational independence by refocusing its activities. Therefore there might be a case for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations. I think you know as well as I do that OLAF’s core tasks – in other words, what was reinforced and, in part, newly established in 1999 – are indeed the internal investigations, the rights to conduct internal investigations, and the duties to do so. I entirely agree with Mr Bösch that more capacities must be established in these areas. At the same time, however, it is also true – as the Eurostat case itself has shown – that sometimes an external investigation becomes an internal investigation because the external investigation suddenly raises the question: Why did these mistakes with the competition process occur? Why are these specific contracts always concluded here?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate one point: the drafting of the action plan which Mr Prodi has outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control is well under way and the text to amend the law of the Regulation will be with you at the start of January, I hope, or at any rate promptly in January. I see many similar approaches on the issue of the amendment of the Regulation. Mrs Theato has just mentioned them again. As the President of the Commission has pledged, we will work very closely on these points with the Committee on Budgetary Control, also in advance of the drafting process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I almost have the impression that we are criticising OLAF out of the blue, yet I had the feeling that President Prodi has been taking OLAF apart with his criticisms while we have been defending it, since so many Members of this House, speaking in today’s debate, have stated that Eurostat is not an OLAF matter, it is a Commission matter. The Commission must finally adopt its own identifiable line here. Otherwise, I am very pleased that it is happy with everything to do with OLAF. In that case, though, I really do not want to hear any more, not from the President of the Commission, about the obvious shortcomings, in terms of quality, which have arisen in connection with Eurostat. That does not mean that we have not moved from our position, and I think there are still a number of misunderstandings as regards the independence of the Supervisory Committee. The Supervisory Committee must, like OLAF’s Director-General, be appointed on an interinstitutional basis; today, it is part of the Commission, and not – lest any myths arise – in a vacuum. We think that there must be a separation, and that includes a physical and financial separation. It is unacceptable that the staffing of the Supervisory Committee, which exercises a monitoring function, should be the ultimate responsibility of a body which is the subject of that monitoring. We have adopted a firm position here and I hope that this House will endorse this position tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
