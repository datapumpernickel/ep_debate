This Regulation set up common rules for the airworthiness of aircraft and established the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">You agreed that an optimum and uniform level of safety could only be achieved by extending the scope of this text, and consequently the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which have been extended to air operations, pilot licensing and safety of third-country aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">You also expressly asked the Commission to make a proposal to this end. It is time to put an end to an anomaly. While planes develop in complete freedom within a unified market, the safety level remains disparate between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">You know as well as I do that the rules worked out by specialised intergovernmental organisations are implemented very differently within the Community. Consequently there are great national disparities, not to mention the fact that it is not always the most rigorous standards that are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked that we should pursue efforts to improve the general level of air safety in Europe. That is the goal of the proposal that we are discussing, since it aims to extend the common rules to air operations, pilot licensing and the safety of third-country aircraft, that is, to give the Community tools that would contribute to increasing the safety of air transport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also reinforces the obligations of Member States in respect of inspection of planes of both third countries and of Member States. It gives the Agency the power of inspection extended to all the activities of the civil aviation authorities of the Member States and their companies as well as the airlines, and that is in order to check that they are complying with the common rules. A system of penalties is also envisaged, such as withdrawal of mutual recognition in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">This text is part of a coherent package of measures for the improvement of aviation safety. I will briefly remind you of them: the black list, which allows those airlines that least respect safety rules to be banned from our countries, the strengthening of systems for the inspection of planes – SAFA directive – and very soon the Commission is going to propose completing this regulatory framework by extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency to airport security and to air navigation, as set out in the attached regulatory proposal that you are examining today.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, by 2010, the Community will have a coherent and uniform set of safety rules and a unique organisation, the European Aviation Safety Agency, responsible for preparing, implementing and completing their application.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate you and to thank you for your contribution to this strategy for the strengthening of European aviation safety. I shall listen with interest to your speeches on this subject that is obviously vital for the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the content itself, what is the state of European airspace at present? In theory, we have a single European sky, but we currently have 27 different safety standards, and that makes some things possible that I do not believe are good. For example, less reputable airlines are currently still able to have the pick of safety standards in Europe, so to speak, depending on the country in which they want to be certified. Then there are European aircraft that do not see their home countries for several years on end, because they operate on other routes and can therefore be inspected only inadequately or not at all, and it has also been relatively difficult to check aircraft flying into the European Union from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expressly welcomed the Commission proposal, which the Commissioner has just presented – and I think the great majority of this House did too. The thing on which we were not always entirely agreed was the way to get the outcome we so much wanted. In principle, I can distinguish three areas here: we were agreed that it is absolutely necessary to check third-country aircraft efficiently, and we were also agreed that the EASA should be able to carry our ramp inspections unhindered.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on how the EASA Management Board should be appointed in future was rather more difficult. In my opinion, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as the competent committee, in its vote proposed a very positive Europeanisation of the whole procedure, with something of a shift from the Member States to the Council and the European Parliament. The second essential question was: what qualifications should be required of the Management Board’s members? Here, too, a satisfactory solution has been found. The question of whether the EASA should be able to impose penalties was rather more difficult. Opinions on this in the House differ, and we shall see how things turn out in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two things that were particularly difficult and which we were unable to get accepted, but I would like to mention them anyway. Firstly – and I have never made any secret of my conviction in the matter – we were unable to agree on more extensive rules for the certification of cabin crew. There seems to be a religious war taking place here – Mr Jarzembowski is just waving at me as a proponent of that war – with an uncompromising For on one side and an uncompromising Against on the other. I can only hope that the solution we have now found will open a door for a solution in the future and that, in the interests of cabin crews and above all of passenger safety, we will not have to wait for that future solution for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question where it was particularly difficult was the one where it is in fact always difficult, namely funding. The EASA budget amounted to 70 million in 2006, funded partly by certification and partly by the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with certification is, firstly, that it is increasingly difficult to get money for some certification tasks and, secondly, there is a desire, which I share, that these certification costs should not be as heavy a burden on small and medium-sized enterprises as on large undertakings, whose larger production runs make it easier for them. An interesting solution would have been to introduce a kind of passenger fee, if you think that 5 cents a ticket could fund half the EASA budget. But there was no agreement on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to tomorrow’s vote with great interest and would like to close by once again expressing my thanks for the close cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats agrees with the approach that, in this day and age, we need to extend the scope of activity of the European Aviation Safety Agency within reason, in order to enhance its effectiveness most importantly with regard to pilot licences, air traffic control and relations with developing countries. We also accept that for this purpose higher numbers and a larger budget are necessary, and are to be constantly subject to control, as this was expressed in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to emphasise a few matters of principle. Firstly: I consider it important that as regards flight staff, we do not touch in any way the compromise concerning training and permits which we have already provided in another form under the so-called EU-OPS. Secondly: I consider it important that in authorising commercial and non-commercial activities, we should retain the distinction between the two. For apart from safety, the parameters of activity and their nature are different, and we should not just try with bureaucratic tools to cause private activities to atrophy. Likewise, in the case of medical examinations and leisure time activities, we must use the principle of subsidiarity. There is no need to complicate things.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the ever more complex tasks, we support the creation of an Executive Committee as well as, in the case of the Management Committee, a greater role in the community. The Council should appoint the delegate of the Member States and should consult with Parliament, and the Commission should hold 25% of the votes, which can be a realistic compromise. I consider it important that the tasks of the EASA in granting type ratings should not hinder the competitiveness of smaller businesses on account of the price and time factor, in comparison to the previous period of national permits. We are opposed to the idea that the EASA should carry out independent punitive responsibilities; this should remain the right of the Member States. It is crucial that the finances of the EASA be transparent, that no outside pressure group be able to gain decisive influence by means of donations. We further oppose the idea of shifting the burden associated with any new obligations to the passengers, since none of this branch receives subsidies but works entirely on a market basis, and the industry pays fees and contributions to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are looking at an extension of the European Aviation Safety Agency. I think it is a good idea, but only if it is done properly. If done in the wrong manner, it would not be positive. We, as members of this committee and this Parliament, know that air travel – and many of us use air travel more than we would like – is actually one of the safest modes of travel available. I think that we need a sensible response and in a single market it is quite appropriate that we should have a European response to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, there are issues in this report about which I have concerns and I would like to draw Members’ attention to some of these. Indeed, the rapporteur is aware of some of my concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 17 highlights my concerns about fines and penalties. I do not believe you can compromise on safety, so I do not think that fines and penalties are an effective measure for correcting safety problems. If there were a safety concern about a particular airline, I would be much happier if that airline’s licence were suspended or its certification revoked. I do not think that we can have half measures. I do not think that a fine or a penalty would make an airline improve in the way that a withdrawal of its certificate would.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Jarzembowski)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Well, let me carry on and I will not interrupt you. I could not hear a word you said, so it may have been important but I missed it completely!</p>
<p class="contents">I also have reservations about fees, because I believe this Agency needs to have a secure footing. The funding needs to be there, they need to know it is going to be continued and I do not think there can be arbitrary limits on the setting of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reservation I have – and Mr Leichtfried spoke about this – is the management board. I think that citizens expect the board members to pay a full role in ensuring their safety. Member States should be able to nominate and vote on qualified people to ensure that their interests and obligations are met.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns Amendment 1. There is a difference between safety and security. They are very separate and it is not clear to me – and I wait to be convinced – about what benefits would be brought by bringing security into this measure, which is to do with air safety. Air security is equally important, but it is a very separate issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is perhaps one of the nicest aspects of our work in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are considering amendments to the Regulations that came into force in 2002 – a logical step which gives us the opportunity to assess and extend the application of the Regulations in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments extend the jurisdiction of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and improve its management, budgeting and other procedures. Much attention has been paid to the confirmation of uniform aviation safety standards and supervision of their implementation. Aviation safety is a priority for all of us. The increasing intensity of air traffic compels us to have a single strong institution; this prevents lack of coordination or disputes between national aviation bodies from having negative consequences on aviation safety. This is why most of the proposed changes are intended to achieve the most important outcome: that of giving the EASA more authority in practice to perform the functions expected of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that in improving the Regulations we sought not just to be stricter and to centralise authority, but also to relax standards in those fields where changing practical circumstances make this possible. One such area is the use of amateur light aircraft. The proposed amendments set more relaxed standards for the issuance of private pilot licences and less strict rules for this type of activity, allowing authorised bodies, for example, pilots' associations, to issue ‘amateur light aircraft pilot licences’.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments are also related to the protection of information sources, which is important when trying to gather vital information about breaches of regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Accompanying remarks about the regulations are likewise aimed at improving the rules for recruiting EASA experts, with a view to maintaining the EASA's ability in the future to attract experienced specialists and to create the conditions for necessary internal training.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to invite colleagues to support these timely and very necessary amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with the rest of the world, Europe needs to ensure that its civil aviation operates safely and effectively when transporting both goods and passengers. The same applies to recreational aviation, aero sports and pilot training.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary technical, organisational and legal measures must therefore be taken. Clearly, issues relating to environmental protection and the workers employed in the aviation industry must not be neglected either. All this obviously has a specific financial dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 currently in force is almost five years old and has served its purpose fairly well. The time has now come, however, for us to take account of the new circumstances that have arisen partly because of the ongoing exponential increase in air traffic movements and the terrorist threat, and partly because of the need to tidy up and unify the whole complicated system of provisions, procedures and standards relating to aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion must therefore be in line with other provisions for this sector, starting with the Chicago Aviation Convention. We must cherish the hope that the European Aviation Safety Agency will be ready to undertake the tasks entrusted to it diligently, working in cooperation with individual Member States, which I believe is very important. We must also hope that safety standards will be unified and that the resulting standards will be high.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth highlighting the important role played by international cooperation in air transport. It is regrettable that there is a lack of representation of the European Union in the ICAO, which is the UN body dealing with global aviation issues. This shortcoming must be remedied. The regulation provides for the Aviation Safety Agency to deal also with aircraft from third countries. This is appropriate, and will allow checks to be carried out to ensure that third country operators meet safety standards before they are authorised to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur as regards increasing the competence of the Agency to include matters currently handled by Eurocontrol. On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I support this regulation and almost all the amendments. I would, however, like to emphasise that our activities must focus primarily on the passenger and on the safety and comfort of his or her journey, including both the time spent at airports and the time in flight. I believe it is necessary to continue the process of harmonising European and global provisions in this important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it seems logical to everyone at first that with a single European sky we also need uniform standards and strong uniform controls if we want to guarantee safety. We must also draw the obvious conclusion from our debate about the ‘black lists’ and see to it that third-country airlines can be inspected as strictly and closely as our own.</p>
<p class="contents">We have created some of the conditions. The Management Board as it is now proposed will be rather better able to act, and to act more quickly, than has been the case up until now. In the matter of funding, apart from the usual fee for the certification of aircraft, which clearly should not be replaced by any form of tax, we must think of certain fees for services that fall outside this area and are not, and cannot be, used commercially, so to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, there was of course much debate about cabin crews; we had the same debate with EU-OPS. It is an issue that needs to be resolved. We must create standards that will also be a safeguard against poor working conditions and social or safety dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Another task for the future will be to cut harmful emissions from aviation to an acceptable level and bring them into the European Union’s climate objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can only applaud, for example, the fact that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is able to contribute towards ensuring the free movement of air technology products, of transport services and of crew, on account of the fact that various licenses, permits and other documents issued via the agency or national offices, on the basis of their own rules, will be automatically accepted in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to express my support for the proposed regulation and for the rapporteur’s work, on the basis of the many years I spent as a pilot. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, measures can sometimes, despite the best intentions, be controversial or even detrimental to some of those affected. One example is the fact that enforcing the EASA in respect of aircraft up to 600 kg does not fundamentally improve aviation, but rather leads to extraordinary costs and a greater administrative load. Manufacturing ultralight aircraft represents an opportunity for our SMEs that have a strong export side to make their mark in difficult world markets including that of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the annex to the regulation unfortunately does not exempt this specialised sector of aviation technology from the implementation of the regulation, unlike a number of other cases, the document will have untold consequences for the competitiveness of manufacturers. It will lead to discrimination in the market, which is certainly not among the objectives of the new legislation and the legal amendments adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find the issues surrounding the imposition of fines confusing. I feel that it would be better to retain the previous practice of taking away licences or not awarding them in the first place. Fines are not a standard measure and there could be a risk of their misuse in the drive to boost the revenues of those in receipt of resources that are collected in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One further point is that some of the proposals in the document affect Member State sovereignty, even though they are unconnected to the criteria of air transport safety. Consequently, we should monitor more carefully all of the consequences of our measures on all citizens and businesses in the EU, as part of the overall fight for greater safety.

<p class="contents">We agreed this morning that there is a large transatlantic market for air services that we want to see further developed. Now the question is: who are the players? In the negotiations we clearly said that we want Europe to be America’s equal. That also means that we must develop the European Aviation Safety Agency into an equal partner of the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The situation today is that the FAA decides which aircraft must be repaired and which must be taken out of service, because it has a high level of competence and has tremendous power in world aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding today on extending the remit of the EASA must be seen in this context. We must progressively bring the EASA up to the same level as the FAA, so that we – Europe and the US – are also represented as partners in the administrative field.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Commissioner, as planned, in the next few weeks we should discuss quietly in committee the release of the reserves for the EASA. The fundamental question for me however is: what equipment and what staff must the EASA have in order to be recognised both by the national aviation safety authorities – because there are still misgivings about that – and by the FAA?</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue down this road – a gradual, careful expansion of the EASA’s competences for both equipment and personnel to make it in fact an equal partner to the FAA – then we will have done our best for our airlines and our passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is my view that the most important issue of note concerning this report is the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has voted in favour of a small number of very important amendments to the Commission proposal that give the European Aviation Safety Agency the power to impose fines with periodic penalty payments if safety standards are not implemented properly. Let us not be confused: the fines are intended to be in addition to more drastic measures, such as licence revoking.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the committee voted in favour of establishing adequate protection for informers – whistleblowers – who could provide information on abuses or non-compliance with the legislation. The committee amendments should be given our full support, as they provide sensible and proper practical means of making sure that aviation safety is given the serious attention it deserves by all concerned and that strict compliance with safety rules is effectively achieved. In this respect, the use of the carrot alone is not good enough in some cases. The stick has important uses too.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighteen months ago my country, Cyprus, suffered a major aviation tragedy, leaving 121 people dead. A report into the causes of that incident points towards major flaws in the implementation of aviation safety standards. If this Commission proposal had been in place at the time, I am sure this air disaster could have been avoided. Therefore, let us hope that this proposal, as amended by the Committee on Transport, will quickly be implemented. The sooner this happens, the better it will be for the avoidance of major air disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, every time a new agency comes into being or an agency’s powers are to be extended on the basis of a regulation, we need to ask ourselves whether the number of people and powers is commensurate with the requirements of the organisation concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Common rules in the area of civil aviation are indisputably important. As with the previous regulation, the problem lies in the definition of civil aviation in the field to which the rules relate. There remains a discrepancy between the rules in the United States and those in the EU, not least in the definition of the specifications of the ultralight category. Perhaps the negotiators in the EU and the US will come to this question at a later stage of negotiation and the outcome will be incorporated into an amendment to the new regulation in force in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Agency, I take the view that the proposed number of employees and the budget are inappropriate for fulfilling the task of coordination and control. National testing has hardly been taken into account. I believe that this question will be assessed and handled by the Council. The proposals in question will strengthen the European Air Safety Agency (EASA). I do not support all of them for practical reasons. In particular, I do not welcome the idea of bringing the testing of ultralights under central control.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in particular to mention Amendment 5, regarding which I fail to understand why the Commission’s proposal restricts small aeroplanes with a take-off mass of 5 700 kg to a maximum number of nine passenger seats. This proposal runs counter to the job of developing small aircraft in the CESAR programme, which was adopted more than a year ago by the Commission on the basis of the third challenge laid down by the Sixth Framework Programme on science and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The new amendment lays down 19 seats for passengers pursuant to the proposal in the CESAR programme. As regards the call for the entire air crew, and not just the pilots, to be qualified, the amendments specify the original wording, and for this reason I support them. Unfortunately, the clear removal of the ultralight category from the scope of the EASA has not happened. As Mr Remek said, this refers to all aircraft lighter than 600 kg. It would be appropriate if, in this category of aeroplanes, the control and testing procedures that have been adopted could be applied in such a way that national testing bodies would continue to perform the verifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dossier that we are debating here today is of the utmost importance for the future of European civil aviation, especially in view of the prospect of a constant increase in air traffic over the coming years and of the European Union’s recent commitments on CO2 emissions, which will certainly affect civil aviation as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), we are seeking to ensure that we have the most stringent civil aviation safety regulations, which will also apply to non-EU operators using European airspace and airports. An assessment of the work carried out by the EASA since 2003 makes it very clear, however, that we need to cautiously extend the Agency’s powers in the areas of air operations, pilot licensing and third-country aircraft, but that must not involve any increase in bureaucracy or unlawful obstacles to the normal performance of this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only support these changes if they will in fact help to increase air safety. The inevitable resulting loss of competences by the national aviation authorities is unacceptable unless there is obvious added value in terms of safety management and the future of European civil aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The common objective that we share thus means giving the EASA the practical powers to carry out the new tasks entrusted to it. Until now, each Member State would, in most cases, adopt its own regulations on the basis of internationally agreed minimum standards, and it is a fact, quite frankly, that Europe’s airspace has always been the safest in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to stress the need to take account of the experience built up by the competent national authorities, so as to ensure that common EU rules are laid down and enforced effectively and that safety is constantly improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into detail – many details have already been mentioned – we can expect that a number of improvements will need to be introduced in several areas, especially as regards greater interaction with the Member States’ aviation authorities. The aim, Madam President, will remain that of providing all passengers flying in European airspace with even greater protection and safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Datele publicate astăzi pe site-ul Comisiei arată că numărul pasagerilor din primele 11 luni ale anului 2006 se ridică la 318 milioane.

<p class="contents">The single market is important, too. If we want to extend the single market, we also need to introduce uniform regulations governing the manufacture and certification of aeroplanes. It is the pilots of ultralight aircraft who are the most exposed to discrepancies in this field. I should like to welcome, in particular, our decision to pay greater attention to leisure pilots.

<p class="contents">I am completely in agreement with him when he says that extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency is an advance for the European Union and for the safety of passengers. Indeed, the Regulation stipulates that third country aircraft will no longer be able to fly in the European Union unless they are certified by the Agency. This text, therefore, brings an improvement in terms of safety. Every aircraft will be inspected and will have to receive certification in order to be authorised to carry passengers in the European Union. It is also an advance in terms of harmonisation of protection for European citizens, which is part, Commissioner, of the extension of the process that was begun with the European black list. This process is intended to allow every passenger to be protected in the same way in every airport in European Community territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to say a word about the way that these new tasks for the European Aviation Safety Agency are to be financed. Amendments proposing levying a tax on plane tickets were tabled in committee. Fortunately, they were rejected. We must stop always wanting to pass on the cost for these measures to passengers. Taxes on plane tickets are already very high and I hope that we will find a way of financing that does not impose a further burden directly on air passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments proposed by your rapporteur reinforce the Commission’s objectives in the interests of aviation safety in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts, therefore, 14 of these amendments, which contribute to this objective. In particular I shall mention the two amendments whose purpose is to allow for the benefit and mutual recognition of the certificates to be automatically withdrawn in the event of failure to respect the common rules. I shall also mention the amendment aimed at obliging the European Aviation Safety Agency to communicate to the Commission all information relevant to the updating of the black list. I also noticed that, in your supplementary amendments, Parliament asks for the inclusion of a reference to the medical certificate in Article 6b, paragraph 4. I would like to indicate my agreement with this proposal because it reflects the Commission’s initial proposal. I am referring to Amendment 34 from Mrs Ticău.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think that 15 of the amendments proposed by your rapporteur are not acceptable as they are and deserve to be debated again. Mr Leichtfried and Mr Evans, your Amendment 17 aims to allow the Agency to impose fines, but this amendment does not seem acceptable to us as it stands. I quite understand the interest in imposing fines in the event of very minor breaches and it is true that the tools currently available to the Agency may, in this respect, seem out of proportion. This proposal for an amendment, however interesting it may be, raises a great number of legal, institutional and practical questions. In order to comment on these important and complex questions, the Commission needs to study them carefully. Indeed, we need to be sure that the legislation that would be put in place complies with the Treaty. In the meantime, as you will understand, the Commission cannot accept this amendment although it agrees that it is of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Leichtfried and Mr Evans, it is difficult for us to accept Amendment 27 which seeks to finance part of the certification process by means of Community subsidy. In 2007, these processes will amount to EUR 9 million. That is an expense that grows rapidly by about 5% a year, without inflation, and which cannot therefore be funded within the scope of the current financial perspectives. Furthermore, this amendment would result in charging taxpayers instead of the businessmen who receive or have received benefits in terms of marketing the products concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments, specifically Amendments 30, 31 and 33, have also just been tabled concerning EU-OPS. As you know, this has been the subject of long and heated debates which finally resulted, last year, in a compromise that was broadly accepted by the three institutions. This compromise Regulation (CE) No 1899/2006 makes provision for its own development. I do not think it is reasonable right now to try to call it into question. I shall ask, therefore, for you to confine yourselves to the amendment voted for in the Committee on Transport and Tourism as well as Amendment 34, which I can support. There, then, are a few points that deserve still to be debated, and which also call for some further information<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr Janowski, the Commission is always seeking the agreement of Member States and of the European Parliament in order to be able to contribute to international organisations on behalf of the Community. I thank the European Parliament for its support. Unfortunately, the Member States have not quite reached the point of understanding the importance of the presence of the Commission and of the Union within international institutions such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Remek raised the problem of light aircraft, which also operate commercially and can reach high speeds. They fly in the same airspace as other planes. It is appropriate for them to be subject to safety rules, although lighter ones, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question, which I have already answered, concerns the Agency’s capacity to carry out these new competences. It may be said that the Agency has the material and human resources necessary to fulfil these tasks. At the end of 2006, that is scarcely four years after it was set up, it had a staff of 280 agents and in the financial statement attached to the proposal before you, provision is made for 330 agents at the end of 2007. That being so, it is true that the Agency’s financial resources pose a problem as, of course, it has to be funded partly by subsidies but also by the fees paid by airline operators who are applying for certification for their aircraft. It is a difficult problem, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, and we shall certainly have the opportunity to return to it because, there too we shall have to find a budget that can remain fairly constant. I shall speak about it again with the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Veyrac reminded us of all the advances that we have made and in which Parliament has really distinguished itself. Does that mean though that this legislation would make the black list redundant? No, because the black list is a repressive tool whose aim is to ban bad carriers from European skies. Prior authorisation to operate in the Community granted to third-country transporters will be a preventive tool intended to guarantee that only companies with an appropriate safety level will be able to fly into the Community. These two pieces of legislation are complementary and one can imagine that one day, indeed, as a result of prevention, repression will lose its usefulness. We are not there yet, but I am just expressing a wish.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, Madam President, while apologising for, no doubt, failing to reply to all the questions asked, to say how grateful I am to the European Parliament for helping us in this way to gradually provide the European Union with legislation for monitoring the safety of aircraft, of air transport, which, in my opinion, will be one of the most effective in the world. We want a European sky that is safe; it is very important for our fellow citizens who will be called upon more and more to use air transport and who, of course, demand proper protection against all safety risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you and again I thank the whole of Parliament for its valuable contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can only support the publication of this report as a result of our having identified, during the five years since the establishment of the Aviation Security Agency, the areas in which regulations need to be modified or perhaps refined, or, on the contrary, where the agency’s scope needs to be expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has sought and has provided answers to these questions. The fact that the Agency’s scope of competences will in the future extend to pilot licensing, air operations, third country aircraft, collective oversight, etc., means that the safety of air transport can only increase; for in these kinds of activities, central procedures can be much more effective than if different regulations were in force within each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no less important that the Agency be prepared to face the challenges of the future, in order to be able to guarantee aviation safety over the long term. We need also to meet the challenges of providing appropriate financing for this purpose. In my opinion, the report takes a significant step forward in this direction as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I congratulate the rapporteur and propose that the report – which can only benefit each European citizen – be adopted as is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
