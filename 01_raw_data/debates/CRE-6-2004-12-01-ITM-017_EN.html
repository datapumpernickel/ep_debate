<p class="contents">Child pornography, and also racist and violent material, is a real problem for our society. Although parents are not always aware, we have also noticed that many of our children make contact with people in chat rooms and then they like to have contact outside chat rooms. Therefore there is real danger.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want this safer Internet programme which has played a key role in the Commission's action to protect minors in the field of audiovisual and information services.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and I am going to be very brief, Mr President, because you asked me to – there are the networks of hotlines where users can report illegal content; there are 18 Member States participating. Then there is the network for raising awareness of safer use of the Internet, with 21 countries participating in network awareness nodes. Then there is content rating and the parental control technologies, where we are setting up an international system for rating Internet content and improving filtering technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The first action plan involved 37 projects bringing together 136 organisations from 70 countries. The new programme is of course going to be in continuity, but also enhancing what we have done so far. It is very simple, there are new technologies, so there are new forms of usage by those who threaten children. Therefore we have to find new answers and that is exactly what we are trying to do, working very closely with the safer Internet forum.</p>
<p class="contents">To make a long story short – and it is story that interests parents and society at large – Parliament and the Commission are working on the same lines. All the amendments today are acceptable, which is good news for Parliament, so there will be no clashes here and we can agree on a general line. That is the way also that I am going to listen to Parliament’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such is the ambitious objective of the Safer Internet Plus<span class="italic"> </span>Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal makes it clear that a decision has been made in favour of self-regulation, with much of the responsibility being laid on parents, educators and other end users. That is an approach that I wholeheartedly support. The programme draws a clear distinction between illegal content and unwanted content. There is a crucial difference, in my view. In that respect, the emphasis is on providing information to parents and educators. That too, I support without reservation.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s four action lines have to do primarily with the fight against illegal content, in particular child pornography. The network of child pornography hotlines in the European Union is being extended, whilst the initiative for setting up such hotlines should come from the Member States themselves, the Commission can, and indeed should, encourage and accelerate this process. After all, it is of major importance that each EU Member State should, as soon as possible, have its own hotline so that we can fight child pornography on the Internet across the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the programme offers Internet users the means of protecting themselves against unwanted content, for example by filtering it. In close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, I have opted mainly for focusing on research into this technology and assessment of it. There are all kinds of content filters available for parents who wish to make use of them, but there is often a great lack of information about how well this technology performs, and this is where the European Union can make a useful contribution. In the framework of the<span class="italic"> </span>Safer Internet Plus Programme, research can be carried out into the performance level of the technology, and it is possible to examine on the basis of precisely which criteria these filters operate. It can also be examined whether filters are sound instruments in any case to help users protect themselves. Indeed, there are plenty of examples of filters that filter away far too much. For example, there are filters that work on the basis of key words and that inadvertently make information about such subjects as sexual education or breast cancer inaccessible. That could never be the intention, of course. Other filters do not filter enough, which effectively renders them useless. We should, moreover, not overlook the fact that children can often very easily deactivate those irritating filters without their parents knowing, so that they can continue to surf to their hearts’ content.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the third action line, which I myself regard as the most important. Many Internet users, particularly parents, are completely oblivious to the risks their children run on the Internet. It follows that many parents have no idea what their children are doing or experiencing on the Internet. In order to promote a truly safe environment for children, we therefore need to invest heavily in providing information to parents. Just as parents try to equip their children to defend themselves in the off-line world and tell them that they should not go off with strangers, parents would also be able to guide their children more effectively on the Internet. For this to happen, though, parents need to be aware of the fact that there are risks. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that another crucial point in the provision of information is technical protection. One result of a lack of protection of Internet users’ own computers is a deluge of unwanted content with which they are confronted. One example that springs to mind is spyware, which constantly guides your Internet browser to a specific porn or gambling website, or irritating pop-ups that you simply cannot remove. A lack of technical protection of the computer can also result in Internet users spreading illegal or unwanted content without them knowing, with all the consequences that this entails. Research has shown that most European broadband users have still not protected their computers sufficiently. Information campaigns should therefore take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth action line concerns the setting up of the Safer Internet Forum. This is a unique discussion forum for industry, Internet providers and software manufacturers, but also for organisations of users, such as parents, child protection agencies, consumer clubs, civil rights movements, and others. This forum offers a space where self-regulation can be developed. Codes of conduct need to be drafted in order to examine how the industry itself can contribute to a safer Internet, for example by means of providing information to its own users, but also by means of sound agreements, on the basis of self-regulation, about transparent and careful notice and take-down procedures, something which is desperately needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to realise that the use of the Internet always poses certain risks. It will never be possible to completely remove all unwanted content from the Internet, nor is that entirely desirable. It is up to parents to guide their children. Just as every parent teaches their children not to go off with strangers when they play outside, there are also rules of conduct for the Internet, and that is why the information, for which this programme makes provision, is so crucial. </p>
<p class="contents">Since the programme is set to enter into effect as soon as January of next year, it was necessary to give it our prompt attention. Over the past few weeks, together with the shadow rapporteurs, I have worked with both the Council and the Commission in a very constructive dialogue, and the present report is the outcome of our efforts. I should thus like to extend warm thanks the shadow rapporteurs and to our partners in the Commission and the Council. We have managed to get virtually all of the points we made taken on board. We have the Commission’s and the Council’s unqualified support for this text, and the report was also approved unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I hope for similar support in the plenary, so that the Safer Internet Plus Programme can take off with the necessary dynamism on 1 January 2005.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Internet is a force for good when it is responsibly used, but it is a force for evil when it is in the hands of morally suspect persons or criminals. This report builds on the work that I did for my own report in the last session, dealing with the issues of child pornography on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very good report and it forms the basis of further work, which we need to do because technology moves on. Technologically, the criminal community often moves on rather faster than the law enforcers. We need to be aware of the fact that this is a highly technologically-based industry. It is also one where we need more codes of conduct, which impinge upon those who make considerable profits as service providers within the business. I do not mind people earning a lot of money but I feel that sometimes this brings with it extra responsibilities, particularly in an area where there is an international dimension. We in Europe must act.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been dealing with money laundering directives recently. It seems to me that the minutiae in regulations in that area, which we require people to abide by, indicate that we are far too flexible and easy-going when it comes to controlling the Internet. Let us by all means take the Internet forward, let us find new technology, but let us make sure that the people who wish to use that technology for evil purposes are curtailed in their actions for the good of all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on safer use of the Internet concerns an issue different from many of the others that we politicians are accustomed to deciding about, but the Internet and new technology require political knowledge and decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I was elected to the European Parliament, I took an active interest, as a female Social Democrat, in the debate about violence, violent pornography on the Internet and the exploitation of children and young people. I am still involved in the debate, but now as both a Member of the European Parliament and as Chairman of the Depiction of Violence Council/Media Council in Sweden, which is responsible for these issues. On the basis of my experience in Sweden, I am especially pleased that the EU is accepting its responsibility for ensuring that the Internet is safer for children and young people and that it will continue to be both entertaining and educational, not only for children and young people but for all who like to surf the Net and use its chat rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee, I talked in particular about children’s use of the Internet. This is a lucrative area for the future, and we as politicians must demand that the industry concerned accept its responsibility and pay for filters and other devices that can remove degenerate material on the Internet and offer protection against it.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, we have been able, by taking part in this EU project on the future of the Internet, to demonstrate the differences between parents’ knowledge of children’s Internet activities and what the children say their parents know. Parents clearly need help in keeping up with developments, which is something we have also been able to offer through the EU project in Sweden by, for example, producing a handbook. I think we must try to continue with such cooperation and exchange of experience in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation, together with internal reform of the Internet are therefore what are required and, through Mrs Mastenbroek’s report, Parliament is well placed to bring about a safer Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Internet can unite people, but it can also divide them on the basis of ideology, politics, possessions, or religion, if used as an instrument of aggression. Concurring with this, I too think that in principle two possible paths lie ahead of the Internet. It is the responsibility of us all to prevent it from embarking on the second of these: the Internet must never become an instrument of aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">The safer Internet programme now before us has this as its objective,<span class="bold"> </span>and I therefore support it. Over the past few years, this initiative has already proven its worth. First and foremost, by fostering the provision of information, it has helped to ensure that the next generation will be more aware users of the Internet. </p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this aspect of the programme, the provision of information, I would like to add a thought concerning the report. In the new Member States of the EU, including my own home country, Hungary, the rate of Internet penetration is typically lower than elsewhere. One of the reasons for this is an unwarranted lack of confidence in the Internet. I therefore feel it is important to emphasise that providing information on the dangers of the Internet, which I too consider important, as outlined above, should always go hand in hand with raising popular awareness of possible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If this does not happen, we are likely to see a slowdown in the rate of Internet penetration in certain Member States. In this regard, the hotline services that are given special mention in the report are of fundamental significance, although familiarity with such services is very limited, especially in the new accession states. One can certainly say that in this regard there is a need for a true breakthrough, and there is a need for the hotlines operating in the Member States to work together a good deal more effectively. There is therefore still considerable work to be done, but the draft before us can contribute to creating a safer and more humane online environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Mastenbroek has completed an excellent report and people who are real experts in this field such as Mrs Segelström and Mr Kirkhope have added their words of support.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus on three or four clear points. One is to congratulate the Commissioner on her words about the proliferation of racist and other violent material, which is on the increase and which is of concern to all of us here in the European Union. I want to raise Mrs Mastenbroek’s very important distinction between illegal material and harmful material. As Mr Kirkhope said, we are dealing here with a hugely imaginative product of technology, something which adds to our freedom and is something that we should handle with great care when we deal with how to curtail some of its excesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up on something practical. On Friday in my constituency I will visit a major charity called Childline. Many children’s charities across the European Union are crying out for the kinds of solutions we see in this report: funded solutions, hotlines. Mrs Mastenbroek, for example, mentioned the possibility of a children-specific hotline being adapted from the hotline approach that we see in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to deal with safer Internet providers, people who are making a great deal of money out of this technology but who also have a real responsibility. It is for us to publicise that need so that there is some peer pressure on Internet providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the older people amongst us, 3G technology will open out this kind of technology even more. The next generation will deal with it. It has to be protected. This report goes a long way towards doing that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

ICT-based and other information technologies, and network security are vital to achieve the Lisbon objectives. We cannot allow criminals, irresponsible crackers and crooks to take over the Internet. Extortion has actually already come to the Internet as far as business is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that by the time this programme is in its final stages the Commission will venture to adopt a strict policy and draft rules for restraint in this sector, which will prevent harmful, illegal and unwanted content. The harm is growing faster than the rate at which measures are being taken to prevent it. For this we could use the services of the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA. We therefore need new rules. Europe does not accept robbery on the highway or piracy on the high seas, so why should it accept such crimes on the Internet?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She deserves to succeed because this project – our joint project and not that of some people who oppose some other people, a project that must involve the whole of society – is intended to provide real support to the benefits that new technologies can bring us, without the negative influences about which the Members of this House have spoken so eloquently.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we shall do everything in the new programme to improve security for parents, and of course the security that they wish for their children. We shall also do everything – and Mr Paasilinna is right in this regard – to bring in a tough policy. After all, we cannot pursue such a policy solely with a softly-softly approach, by taking the soft law route. We should, instead, be basing new policy on the third pillar, which offers the possibility of policies that are tougher but more difficult to put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, Mr President, I feel it is crucial that general awareness is raised of a known problem. We must also be clear – and Members of this House have expressed this very well – that if we do not grab this problem by the scruff of the neck, that if we are not able to resolve the problem, then what could be and will be an important technology for Lisbon will not be moving harmoniously in the right direction. We therefore have a responsibility towards our society and the weaker elements thereof to be proactive. In this regard, I thank Parliament and its Members for helping the Commission and the Council to accomplish their task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years I have been taking political action in the European Parliament, tabling dozens of motions for resolutions and questions and issuing countless press releases and statements, in order to have democratic rules established, that is to say rules and laws that protect the citizen and punish those who use the Internet for criminal purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">This year I have succeeded in having the objectives of the Daphne programme include the request to ‘study the possibility of creating filters to stop the spread of child pornography on the Internet’. Now, at last, the Council and Parliament have decided to set up a new programme to promote safer use of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need an awareness campaign, greater funding, and a more incisive attack on the use that criminals make of the Internet. In that context I must point out that in Italy I have brought a ground-breaking suit against a site that puts out false information about Members of the European Parliament and about Europe. There is no case-law yet on the subject, and so we do not know how to stop a citizen of one Member State from spreading falsehoods about a citizen of another Member State.
