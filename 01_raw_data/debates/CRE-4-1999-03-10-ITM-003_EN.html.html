<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity today – immediately before the foreign ministers begin the final round of Agenda 2000 negotiations at their informal meeting this coming weekend – to give you an overview of developments in the Council and inform you of how the negotiations on Agenda 2000 will proceed in the run‐up to the European Council in Berlin on 24 and 25 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Some weeks have passed since this subject was last debated here in the plenary on 10 February, and in that time the Council has made considerable progress in its search for a balanced overall package. Of course, I am not giving anything away when I tell you that on some pivotal issues a compromise has not yet been reached. That is entirely due to the nature of the project and was not to be expected; it simply illustrates the need to find a balanced solution across all the sectors. As the holders of the presidency, we assumed from the outset that the overall package could only be tied up in Berlin, and this will indeed be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks, however, it has been possible to make significant progress on the necessary preliminary work which is intended to prepare the ground for the Berlin summit. For example, the conclave of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on 21 February made substantial progress on a number of issues. I should like to outline this for you briefly. It is now generally acknowledged that the use of constant 1999 prices for drawing up the financial perspective offers a number of practical advantages. As far as accession and pre‐accession expenditure is concerned, it is agreed that expenditure intended for the applicant countries will be set aside and clearly identified as either pre‐accession expenditure or expenditure solely for accession, so as to ensure that appropriations for the new Member States cannot be used by the present 15 Member States and that, by the same token, appropriations earmarked for the present 15 Member States cannot be used to cover the costs of enlargement. The presidency has put forward a proposal on this which meets with the approval of the vast majority of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also able to note a large measure of agreement on the amounts proposed by the Commission for pre‐accession aid in the immediate future. The fact that we already reached a broad political agreement on the pre‐accession instruments under the Austrian Presidency therefore sends out a clear signal to the applicant countries that we attach particular importance to the pre‐accession instruments, as they will enable enlargement to come about quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been possible to reach agreement on several key aspects of the future financing of the common agricultural policy: it was agreed to keep the agricultural guideline and review it before the first enlargement, and to set a ceiling below that which better reflects actual expenditure. As regards structural expenditure, further consideration is being given to a presidency proposal which takes account of both the need to stabilise expenditure and the need to consolidate the cohesion effort.</p>
<p class="contents">This plan proposes stabilising Structural Fund expenditure; this will involve the average per capita level of aid for the three objectives being consolidated at current levels for the forthcoming period. In general, there is support for reducing the number of Community initiatives to three, provided that the existing scope of other initiatives, which have proved to be effective, is covered by the core objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">For Categories 3 to 5, as a basis for further negotiations, the delegations set ranges within which the final annual ceilings will lie. A large measure of agreement could be noted on Category 6, reserves. On the subject of own resources and budgetary imbalances, the ministers made an initial assessment of the elements which might form part of a comprehensive agreement. It was generally felt that a final agreement – if it is to improve the balance of the financial framework – will require a combination of measures on both the expenditure and revenue sides. At the same time, account will be taken of the effects the political reforms contained within Agenda 2000 will have on the Member States, and also of the need to implement measures of this kind in several phases, with the first phase beginning in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the foreign ministers" deliberations, the Heads of State and Government met on 26 February at Petersberg near Bonn and discussed Agenda 2000 as a whole for the first time, exploring the scope for an overall political compromise. It was clear from the outset that the aim could not be fundamental decisions or even an overall agreement. Neither were we surprised, therefore, when the compromise paper presented by the German Presidency attracted not only support but also criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to point out that the criticism came from both sides. We were criticised both by the Member States which want to save more and by the Member States which want to spend more. I think that this puts us more or less in the middle, and if we agree that a compromise certainly has to be found somewhere between the extreme positions, then I have a feeling that the presidency is not so very wide of the mark.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">In the end, a number of important and useful pointers came out of the meeting of the Heads of State and Government, and these will form the basis of the further work of the Council – in its various configurations – in the run‐up to the special summit in Berlin. The most important point is that all the partners have once again reaffirmed their determination to comply with the instructions of the Cardiff European Council, and to achieve an overall political agreement by the end of March 1999 at the latest. On behalf of the presidency, I should also like to make it perfectly clear and state in all seriousness here that we will not abandon this goal and that we will strictly refuse to engage in any discussion on a possible extension of the deadline, also because this is in Parliament"s interests.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The principles governing the negotiating procedure, which were agreed at the Vienna European Council, were confirmed: Agenda 2000 to be treated as a complete package; all the Member States to be willing to compromise, and a need for all the elements to be on the table. That was on 26 February; today it is 10 March and all the elements are no longer on the table. In terms of substance, it became clear that no one is seriously calling into question the need for budgetary stabilisation and budgetary discipline. The feeling prevails amongst all the Member States that at a time when national budgets are characterised by austerity, it would be unacceptable to deliver anything other than this to the public. There is a general conviction, therefore, that at the end of March in Berlin it will be possible to reach an overall compromise which respects the own resources ceiling of 1.27 %.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion which the Heads of State and Government had on the future financing of the common agricultural policy also took account, to a large extent, of the need for budgetary stabilisation. A majority of the Heads of State and Government came down in favour of giving the agriculture ministers clear instructions to reconcile agricultural reform and genuine stability, and in this context also to examine various models for making step‐by‐step reductions in agricultural subsidies. In the course of their deliberations this week and last, the agriculture ministers have been endeavouring to produce a basis for a genuine and reasonable reform while satisfying the austerity constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress is being made as we speak which, given the diversity of different interests and the complexity of the subject, is to be judged favourably. It also makes me all the more confident that it will be possible to finalise a result in Berlin which will be acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In structural policy, the overall approach to be adopted towards appropriations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds remains controversial. Support was expressed for the presidency proposal to provide EUR 200 billion for the period 2000 to 2006 for Category 2, that is including the Cohesion Fund, but – and I must be quite clear about this – it was also violently opposed. The issue of the appropriations to be allocated is being given further careful consideration at the present time, along with various models. I am assuming that it will only be possible to resolve this issue in the very last phase of the negotiations, that is in Berlin itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, there is agreement on the transitional arrangements for regions coming off aid, although some details are still to be decided. On the issue of own resources and budgetary imbalances, there is a general willingness in the Council to review the decision on own resources, provided that this initiative is part of a balanced package which also takes account of the expenditure side. This will be a question of combining the right measures with a phased or staged approach. It might also be appropriate to incorporate a safety net into the overall package.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the summit at Petersberg near Bonn, the presidency has once again stepped up negotiations at all levels. The scope of the negotiations was revised in the light of the discussions and will once again be presented for discussion to the foreign ministers this weekend and the ECOFIN Council next Monday. In his capacity as President‐in‐Office of the Council, the Chancellor will tour all the capitals between 15 and 19 March; he will discuss the results achieved so far with the Heads of State and Government and will try, as a result of the tour, to bring home with him the makings of a compromise. Following this, the General Affairs Council, meeting on 22 March, and a preliminary conclave, meeting on 21 March, will make the final preparations for the European Council in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil Robles, was invited by Chancellor Schröder to meet the Heads of State and Government at Petersberg and to present Parliament"s thoughts on Agenda 2000. This is what happened, and it underlines the great political importance which the Council attaches to dialogue with Parliament. In this context, Chancellor Schröder emphasised that this dialogue is not a one‐way street, but that it should allow both the Council and Parliament to influence each other"s opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">My stay here in Strasbourg today and tomorrow will include further informal consultations on the Structural Funds and the pre‐accession instruments and will therefore promote cooperation between the Council and Parliament, which is vital if Agenda 2000 is to be resolved on time. Our Minister, Mr Funke, will also be taking part in separate discussions with Parliament on agricultural policy shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the presidency will do its utmost to ensure that Parliament will be able to see its concerns reflected in the results of the Berlin summit. I think that we all want this great challenge that is Agenda 2000 to yield workable results for the future of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santer, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, the coming weeks will be crucial for the Union"s future. We are preparing to take decisions on Agenda 2000 which will be decisive in meeting the challenges of the 21st century and which will pave the way for the Union to welcome a substantial number of new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to conclude negotiations by the end of this month and to adopt the necessary reforms. I should like to stress once again why this deadline must be met. First of all, we must maintain the new momentum which the Union has shown with the euro. Secondly, we must make proper preparations for the new structural programmes for the period 2000 to 2006. Finally, we must send a clear message to the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing to be gained by procrastinating, and much to be lost. The European Council must now assume its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one thing to express the political will to conclude this package. It is another thing to accept the compromises needed to implement it. This means respecting several principles at the same time. First of all, there is budgetary discipline, to which the two arms of the budgetary authority have attached considerable importance in recent years. Then you must also have the necessary resources to finance the Union"s projects: growth and employment, solidarity through economic and monetary cohesion, a viable agricultural policy and, finally, enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the Commission is keen to ensure that the issue of financing the Union does not get reduced to pushing figures around on paper. While budgetary discipline is most certainly necessary, it must not become an end in itself with no attention being given to our actual ambitions for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in this context, I should like to make a comment which in my view is important. In our proposals on Agenda 2000, we drew attention to the resources which should be made available to the institutions, and to the Commission in particular, in order to achieve the stated ambitions. I want to say very clearly that the Commission is no longer be prepared to accept ever‐increasing tasks without receiving the means to execute them. A compromise must be reached in Berlin and this is perfectly possible. It is possible because a great deal of headway has been made with the preparatory work, especially on the legislation. In this respect, I would congratulate Parliament on its commitment and its attitude to the legislative process. A lot of progress has also been made in terms of the interinstitutional agreement. Moreover, with regard to those matters not yet resolved, all the elements are now on the table to put together a package which should be acceptable to all.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to briefly review the three key areas in which we must make further progress. First of all, I would like to look at the common agricultural policy and rural development. The negotiations in the Agriculture Council are difficult and are still going on. I cannot therefore go into the details. The real problem facing us is the call for genuine stabilisation of expenditure on the one hand and the need for a real reform of the common market organisations on the other. There are different ways of reconciling these objectives. Some have spoken of phased reductions, others of cofinancing. The Commission is prepared to consider all the options, but there is one direction it refuses to take, that of a diluted and distorted reform. This would be contrary to the interests of Europe and its farmers. It would be irresponsible to allow expensive intervention stocks to build up again which would eventually send CAP expenditure through the roof. We must also take action straight away to prepare the ground for the forthcoming negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem still to be resolved concerns economic and social cohesion. By way of a preliminary remark, I would like to point out that the solidarity implied in this concept is, and must remain, one of the cornerstones of the European Union. There can be no question of the Commission going back on what was achieved with the last financial perspective, though this area too must be subject to budgetary discipline. I believe that a reasonable compromise would involve consolidating the solidarity effort on the basis of the level of aid achieved in 1999.But resources must be targeted more on the regions and groups within our society that need them most. It cannot be right for more than half the Union"s population to be dependent, in one way or another, on aid from the Structural Funds. As always in the Union, we will find the appropriate transitional solutions that enable us to avoid excessively brutal shocks. We will also take account of certain specific situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the third item of Agenda 2000, the financial aspects. In its October 1998 report on own resources, the Commission placed a number of possible options on the table. It added that it was prepared to make the necessary proposals if there were signs that the Member States could reach an agreement. At Petersberg I saw that most of the Heads of State and Government do not believe it is possible to achieve a balanced compromise unless action is taken on the issue of how to finance our policies. In particular, the question of fairness of contributions to the Community budget was raised.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to admit that this is a political issue, but at the same time, we must not allow everything to hinge on the highly ambiguous concept of net balances. Everybody at Petersberg stated what they wanted and how far they were able to go. We can now sketch the outlines within which a compromise will have to be reached. Personally, I do not rule out a phased solution. In fact, some of our financing mechanisms were devised at a time when enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe was no more than a distant prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a very difficult task on our hands. In recent times, and in particular in connection with the launch of the single currency, the Union has shown that when faced with important occasions, it is able to overcome national differences. Each time, the political will of the College has been there to see us through. The Berlin summit is another such important occasion. Agenda 2000 is essential for the future of the Union and for the future of the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Day after day, the conflicts around us show just how important it is to make progress on the path towards the peaceful reconciliation of our continent. It is something I have said frequently but I will say it again to you here today: for the first time in 500 years, we have the unique opportunity to achieve this objective while our people live in peace and freedom. I am confident that this process, guided by the Community method, will be crowned with success.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the President‐in‐Office and the President of the Commission for the detailed accounts they have given us of the current situation. However, I do not believe that they have told us anything new. All three institutions are concerned about the need to reach a political agreement this month if we want to fulfill the objective of approving all of Agenda 2000 during the German Presidency. The Socialist Group naturally shares the concern of the President‐in‐Office and the President of the Commission that we have not as yet reached a definitive agreement. Nevertheless, we hope that we might be able to lay the foundations of such an agreement, particularly after Chancellor Schroeder"s tour of the capitals which begins on 15 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main concern in the Socialist Group is to ensure that we do not destroy what we have already achieved, namely Agenda 2000 itself. The Commission"s document was supported by a broad majority in this House and we still believe that it is the key element for the future funding and the future financial perspectives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Agenda 2000 package, the financial discussions should not allow us to forget that there are certain basic aims forming part of the European Union"s policy which we must not renege on. The first is the principle that there must be sufficient funding to develop Community policies. I do not know of any type of policy that can be implemented without funding. It may be that in recent years we have devoted too much time to discussing exclusively financial issues and that this has tarnished the Community"s image in the eyes of the public. There is the risk that all we appear to do is haggle between governments over what each must pay, despite the fact that this clearly forms part of politics too. However, it is absolutely clear that no policy – be it national, regional or local – can be implemented without sufficient funds. I therefore believe that the principle of having sufficient resources for Community policies is a key element.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has set out a series of priorities that, in my view, are similar to those of the Member States and the Commission. For example, we all believe that employment is a priority and it is a major concern of our citizens. In a Europe where 18 million people are unemployed, the issue of employment is extremely important. In fact, this priority was marked by an extraordinary European Council, the Luxembourg European Council, and I imagine that it has not been forgotten in the Council"s deliberations. In my opinion, it is not enough to have national policies to combat unemployment from now on. As President Santer pointed out and as was confirmed by the Luxembourg summit, what we need is a Community employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point – and this is no less important – concerns the question of cohesion. A community cannot be built at two different speeds where some countries or regions are more developed and others are less so. The last report by the Commission on cohesion policy highlighted the fact that the Community policies have been effective in reducing the differences between various regions in terms of the level of development. The creation of a community where there are different levels of development would harm not only the less developed regions but also the more developed regions and sectors, as they would find that the levels of consumption would be too low in the regions with a lower purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one very important issue for the European Parliament"s Socialist Group is the environment. It is clear that we need sustained and sustainable economic development. There is no point in pursuing economic development that cannot be maintained in the long run, and one of the elements or pillars of that economic development is, in fact, the preservation of the ecological balance. This is something that all our people are calling for at the moment. There was a time when ecological issues were perhaps only raised in the more developed countries. However, today we can say that all Europeans are ‘green" and that the ‘green" label can no longer belong to a single political group because, at least within the Socialist Group, we are naturally very concerned about environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is aware of the same contradictions as the Council. We have exactly the same ideas as those you have to discuss within the Council. Moreover, we fully understand the difficulties the Council faces and our concern is to ensure that the timetable is met. The Socialist Group believes – and the President of the Commission also highlighted this – that it is extremely important to meet the timetable set for 1999. Our group is doing all in its power to adjust to that timetable and if the Council fulfills its duties, the European Socialists will make every effort to ensure that the European Parliament can do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are now at a stage where we are doing the hard work in the engine room to further the construction of Europe. The German Presidency has had some thankless work to do, but without it the European Union would not move forward. The Socialist Group hopes that once this hard slog is over, once this work has been done properly – which is what we expect of the German Presidency, and this German Government in particular – we might be able to strike off on a new path. The end of the German Presidency should mark the end of these lesser discussions on strictly budgetary issues and a new beginning along a path set out by the Presidency of the Council and by the Presidency of the Commission in Agenda 2000. This path should lead us to a wider Europe into which we can welcome the millions of Europeans who are currently facing enormous difficulties and whose problems are much greater than our own. Indeed, our reach should also extend even further, as it is not only the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have expectations of us, but also the Mediterranean countries, Latin America, Africa and the third world in general.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brok </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, I hope that the President‐in‐Office was right when he said that he had a feeling that the German Presidency was close to the mark. I hope that he is not mistaken, because of course the German Presidency did not make life very easy for itself from the very start. It made grand speeches at the end of last year setting itself high standards. It also said what Germany ought to gain from all this, and we will see how this measures up. In any case, there has been no improvement on the initial position of finding a compromise solution for the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European People"s Party will be prepared to play a constructive role in this process – despite all that has been said – and to help to find a solution which will allow us to steer the European Union forward. If you are to bring about an agreement which will benefit the European Union, you will of course also need the support of our group. But this has to be a good agreement, not an agreement for its own sake, not an agreement at any price, but an agreement which makes sense, which respects budgetary discipline and which contains the necessary reforms, if we are to be able to support it, and if at the same time we are to retain scope for enlargement within the 1.27 % which you mentioned. I believe that this is of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must of course also say that the debate on rural areas and agriculture is a very important one for our group. If degressive models are agreed which mean that farmers" income is reduced and if appropriations can only be spent in certain areas without being of benefit to agriculture itself, then this is a point which we will have to consider very carefully in terms of the overall balance. This is certainly not something you did not already know.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it should also be said – and this is in the joint motion – that we are not prepared to put at stake the principles underlying the internal market in the negotiations on structural policy, and that controls on subsidies must continue to be recognised as one of the basic preconditions for the proper functioning of a common market and should not be abolished as part of the structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, nor must we allow discussions held in connection with the employment pact to jeopardise the largest project which we have tackled for years, namely the introduction of the euro. At this stage, we should stop reducing interest rates – this is also a request to the President‐in‐Office of the ECOFIN Council – as this will cause the value of the euro to fall still further. We must make our contribution to stabilising the euro, and the German Presidency has a particular responsibility here. I believe that this responsibility can be assumed in an appropriate manner in the latter part of the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will briefly address one final point. The Cologne summit will establish a mandate for the next intergovernmental conference, and we should like to know from the German Presidency whether, when it is preparing this mandate, it will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament about the issues which should take priority and be dealt with at an intergovernmental conference of this kind, and whether it is also prepared to involve the European Parliament in the negotiations on amendments to the Treaty, changes to the decision‐making structures and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me draw your attention one last time to one of Parliament"s resolutions. You will respect democracy in the European Union if you nominate the President of the Commission after the European Parliament elections, because if you make a nomination beforehand, which does not take account of the outcome of the Parliament elections, then you run the risk of the Council proposal being rejected by this House, and that is why we should rethink this timetable.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, in a sense of course it is true that the Community is approaching the moment of truth. As both President Santer and President Verheugen were saying, if there is to be no agreement by the end of this month then there will be difficulties. Indeed it is very useful that there is no speculation about delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In this time of difficulties in the Commission, I would like to say that Agenda 2000, which was put forward two years ago by the Commission should still be the basis of the overall approach. It is only on that basis that a balanced approach can be found. It is necessary that, irrespective of the haggling about individual finance, that approach should be kept. The Liberal Group, especially, will judge the overall outcome on whether or not it deviates from the future development for a viable European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background we welcome the fact that the President‐in‐Office of the Council has indicated that already, at this stage, there is an agreement that money available for enlargement will be set aside. It is essential that our internal haggling is not at the expenses of the new candidate countries. Only in that way can we identify the real political will which was our starting‐point. We really want to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">On the CAP, President Santer indicated that there is a basic conflict, on the one hand between stabilisation, and on the other hand a real reform. We, in the Liberal Group, accept real stabilisation. It has perhaps taken too long for us to become aware that there is a limit to financial growth. At the same time, real reform is necessary. It is essential that we do not have a make‐believe reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group believes that within the overall envelope it is possible to carry out reforms but rural development should be part of a structural policy, which takes a broader view than the purely agricultural. That is an essential point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of own resources. We still believe that the approach in the Haug report – namely that the corrections should primarily be made in terms of expenditure rather than in the area of revenue – is important. Why? Because a special rebate which has now been there for a very long time should not be the model for future financing. If I understand the President‐in‐Office of the Council correctly, the phased approach also means that individual adjustments will finally be phased out and we will arrive at an equitable and balanced approach where all countries can really feel that they are participating. That would be the right approach for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the presidency and the President of the Commission every success for a positive result in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, the Agenda 2000 negotiations now under way are among the most difficult which the European Union has faced as an institution and political entity since the foundation of the European Economic Community. The Union can take credit for the bold and innovative initiatives which it has taken over the last 10 years in order to improve the competitive performance of European economies. European leaders and European Union institutions can equally point to the fact that an internal market has been put in place, allowing free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, as well as the creation of a new single currency regime which commands so much influence within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations which brought about the internal market and the single European currency were difficult but were always based on the premise that stability of the European Union is paramount at all times. This must be the overriding consideration of European Union leaders as they search for agreement on the key aspects of future EU policies under the Agenda 2000 programme. The EU governments must look to the issue of reforming the EU budget, the common agricultural policy and the EU structural funds in a balanced, even‐handed manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The partnership approach involving all European governments and all the institutions in order to develop and formulate key EU policies must always be preserved. We should remember at this time that the European Union budget only amounts to a little more than 2 % of the overall spending undertaken by the 15 Member States of the Union in any given year. One option to reform the European Union budget which is not acceptable is the renationalising of the common agricultural policy back into the remit of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy is a uniform European‐wide programme. Its operation will clearly be fragmented and distorted if national governments within the EU have to contribute 25 % of all CAP payments to their respective farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, I welcome the recent support given by the Commission for Ireland to continue to receive cohesion funds until the year 2003. 17 % of all expenditure carried out on improving our roads, water treatment and transport networks under our capital programme originates from the European regional cohesion funds.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Puerta </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> <span class="italic">‐ (ES)</span> Mr President, the decision on the Union"s financial perspectives is becoming extremely difficult politically, giving the impression of a confrontation of national interests without a common vision of European integration. Moreover, the economic outlook is not positive. Economic growth is lower than expected, exports and investment have fallen, and inflation has reached an all‐time low, forcing us to consider the problems that affect a deflationary economy. I might add that we share some of the concerns expressed by Mr Lafontaine.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous enlargements of the European Union were always preceded by a considerable increase in the budget, but the Agenda 2000 budget is so inadequate that it does not allow us to guarantee internal solidarity and cope with the new members. When we talk about enlargement, what we are really doing is endangering the economic and social cohesion of the Europe of Fifteen, without any thought to the future, with less solidarity, without a social dimension and without a genuine employment policy. Regardless of how much rhetoric we use, it is not possible to enlarge Europe with this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s initial proposal was better in that it reflected a possible and reasonable balance, with the contributions from the Member States more in proportion in terms of the Community"s gross domestic product. However, the Council disregarded this proposal and focused the debate on reducing expenditure. As a result, the approach adopted by certain governments, who are calling for a reduction in their net contribution to the Community budget without taking account of the commercial advantages of the internal market, is making the negotiations very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency is at fault in that it has not helped to solve the problems in a situation where the Commission no longer has the ability to mediate. In that respect, we must point out that we cannot accept the philosophy of net balances. We should instead move towards reaching a solution that we can all support. In our view, it would not be acceptable to make drastic cuts in the Structural Funds and agricultural spending, thereby unfairly penalising certain countries and certain production sectors. As far as the agricultural policy is concerned, we have already rejected the negative proposal to cofinance expenditure. The best economic and social solution would be to introduce a fairer differentiation of aid: the current system is unfair as 20 % of farmers receive 80 % of the aid distributed. With correct differentiation, we could ensure that aid was distributed more fairly and we could provide specific solutions for producers of milk, beef and veal, and cereals. We could also reduce budgetary expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspectives must be approved unanimously in the Council and by a sufficient majority in Parliament. It would therefore be better to reach a balanced solution. The agreement must be acceptable to all, not only a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover – and I would like to address this specifically to the Council – we want to see very practical political deliberations. We are convinced of the importance of a strong and legitimate Commission for the future of the Union. We would therefore call on the European Council to postpone the nomination of its candidate for the Presidency of the Commission until after the European elections, and we would like a response on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would point out that the extraordinary European Council on 25 March in Berlin will coincide with the anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. Given the uncertainty that exists, we call on the German Presidency and on all the Heads of State and Government to unite once again and commit to a common political project. We urge them to fulfill their responsibilities. And an essential condition is to reach a fair agreement on Agenda 2000 so that no government or country is the winner. The only winners should be the European Union and all its people.</p>

A delay would send out a fateful signal to the EU and the outside world and would only encourage nationalist forces. We must not allow this to happen. If next year we are to continue to provide structural support – the internal bridge between poor and rich regions – then we need an agreement on Agenda 2000 which, in small matters and in large, is characterised by solidarity, will be workable in the future and leaves no room for national egoism. Outwardly, the failure of the summit would mean the failure of the great pan‐European project of eastward enlargement. That is why there is no room here for exaggerated national demands.</p>
<p class="contents">We make this plea to the Council: all the Heads of State and Government must travel to Berlin prepared in all earnest to close the gap between them. That applies just as much to the German Government as it does to the southern countries. Because when huge efforts have been required of the applicant countries for years, it would be a fateful sign if the EU were simply not to hand in its homework. The European Parliament has proved through the compromises in its reports that an agreement is possible, including on the crucial points. The demands are balanced and they are before the Council. So it is possible!</p>

<p class="contents">We have become somewhat concerned over recent weeks, the difficulties seeming more serious than expected. In such a climate, the Berlin summit assumes great importance. It is essential for Berlin to provide new momentum and to demonstrate that the initial differences are now being overcome. A European Union without optimism and without the will to act would be in very poor shape to tackle forthcoming key events such as the parliamentary elections on 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress one point: budgetary resources. We are perfectly aware of the need to reform the public finances of our Member States but, for all that, and even if it is not exactly what certain governments state, it would be a dangerous calculation to refuse the Union sufficient resources to succeed in doing what is requested of it.</p>
<p class="contents">By this I am not of course speaking of the waste and malfunctioning in the Commission"s management practices, which have already been denounced. Leaving aside these errors, which must of course be corrected, I am speaking of deep‐rooted problems, for example, the preservation of the European agricultural model, the policy of cohesion and solidarity, and Europe"s competitiveness in the high technology sector. I am also referring to the success of enlargement, as without a minimum of resources the tension will jeopardise European integration as a whole. Finally, I am referring to the Union drawing up and implementing economic, social and employment policies – within the framework of the Treaties of course – which are worthy of the name. This also calls for a minimum level of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing to manage the Union"s finances with care. But it would be dangerous to manage them sparingly. Not only do the Union"s policies risk running out of steam, but there is the danger that the Community spirit might weaken. Today we are again discussing renationalisation and direct national contributions. Fortunately, the German Presidency seems to have abandoned this dangerous idea with regard to the common agricultural policy. We are also again discussing net contributors, positive and negative balances, British cheques, and so on. I do not deny that it is sometimes necessary to have a close look at the accounts and to seek new balances, but we must not recreate the climate of 1984.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Berlin summit will largely decide the survival and even the strengthening of the Community spirit. I hope that we will be heard.</p>

I am not sure whether this excellent and instructive proverb is also found in the other ten official languages. It exists in Danish at least, and I am reminded of it almost every day in the institutions of the European Union, because these institutions – the Council, the Commission and this Parliament – have never grasped the wisdom, the very simple wisdom contained in the Norwegian handbook for mountain walkers, which says: ‘in the event of disagreement between the map and the terrain, you should follow the terrain'. In this Parliament – and in all the EU's institutions, including the Commission and the Council – people consistently and with an almost religious zeal follow the once adopted map and ignore the terrain. The terrain will have its revenge, and I shall mention three points without going into detail, because my speaking time will not allow that.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in our opinion – and in the opinion of many Danish andNordic citizens – the enlargement project is heading in the wrong direction. On the one hand, the process which is taking place is humiliating for the applicant countries and, on the other hand, it has – to put it mildly – not been properly thought out in political terms. It is not a project which is based on democratisation, but one which is about empire‐building. Secondly, the political conditions have at best not been properly thought out and the financial conditions, which are the subject of the extraordinary summit in Berlin, leave the gigantic money machines which the European Union has built up over the years in total chaos, in particular the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. This is a sharp reminder that you cannot ignore the terrain without the terrain taking revenge at some stage. Thirdly, this summit is taking place only days after we in Parliament were discussing the most serious constitutional crisis the institutions have yet faced, and I can imagine that – as so often in the past – the agenda of this summit will be different from the one which reflects the current political reality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Muscardini </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, the extraordinary Berlin summit has been convened to unravel a complex tangle and solve a fairly knotty problem. Budgetary adjustment, the cost of enlargement, the future of the CAP and structural policy reform are all on the agenda. We shall never tire of repeating that the complexity of the problems and solutions would have been less traumatic if the institutional structure had been overhauled prior to enlargement and, consequently, the balance of power within the Union redressed. But now the thorny problems already on the table are compounded by the bombshell of Germany's call for a reduction in its budget contribution. Forgetting the overall input from Community coffers to the development of the five ex‐Communist <span class="italic">Länder</span> , the German Government is now playing the card once used by Mrs Thatcher, a tactic which blocked Community activity for quite some time and has left an unpleasant aftertaste. Our first request to the German Presidency is that it should spare the Union a repeat of past performance, whereby problems are bounced from one summit to the next and resolved to the disadvantage of one group or another, one country or another, poisoning minds and keeping the public away from the ballot box next June.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that agricultural reform will be confined to a mere cost‐cutting exercise, rather than aiming for quality production and safeguarding the certificate of origin, the sole guarantee that a product is typical and meets consumer demands. Extensive, American‐style agriculture, rather than intensive farming as preferred in Europe, would destroy all that is distinctive about our specialities in the various production sectors. Germany's point that agriculture accounts for only 4 % of EU GDP is too narrow‐minded: we must not overlook related sectors, the agri‐food industry, processing and farm machinery. But even if the contribution to GDP really were so minimal, let us not forget that farming in Europe also represents a civilisation, a way of life and tradition which it would be criminal to abandon in favour of canned foods from the hypermarket shelves and futuristic transgenic products. Why not set up a European agency to manage any surpluses generated, dispatching these to countries experiencing production shortfalls or lean years? By the same token, monetary donations to humanitarian associations could at least partly take the form of foodstuffs, thereby indirectly compensating for market fluctuations.</p>

Firstly, Europe needs a socially responsible support policy which assists the weak and demands practical solidarity from the strong while also giving them the necessary freedom. Secondly, through its structural and support policies in rural areas, Europe must also make determined efforts to safeguard existing jobs and create new ones, because for Socialists throughout the Union, labour market policy must be the number one priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions made in Berlin must and will be positive for the EU. Given the diversity of the issues and the fact that they are crucial to the EU"s future, compromises are obviously going to be necessary, as they are in any democratic system. Anyone announcing to the House here and now, for the benefit of the media, that they alone will come back a winner is certainly about to become painfully isolated. Those who are already talking in terms of a crisis, dispensing advice in the manner of a schoolteacher and heavily criticising the way in which the German Presidency is conducting the negotiations should recall, Mr Brok, that many of the problems which are having to be tackled here have been put off for years, and that there are a good many who watched without a word of protest while two thirds of the agriculture budget of DEM 75 billion disappeared for entirely economic reasons and was not even spent as we intended, but was instead poured into export subsidies and storage costs. This is a policy which is unsocial, if not even antisocial!</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence is clearer in agricultural policy than in any other EU policy that if the old support system is continued, smaller concerns will be – as they have been for years – the ones to suffer, not to say the foolish ones, and basically this is the way it will stay. In the meantime – and this too needs to be stated in this House – lobbyists on the look‐out for a convincing policy have hit upon a new idea. Suddenly they are saying: away with all subsidies, away with all bureaucracy. We only want a regulated market.</p>
<p class="contents">But if you take a look at this system or this new proposal, this regulated market turns out to be a European Union which is closed off to the outside world, managed, as it were, like a sandpit. However, a fortress state of this kind, in the 19th century style, would not only mean an end to the common market and the free movement of goods. Those who advocate such utter foolishness – because they have run out of ideas and people are running away from them – are also, and with a complete lack of responsibility, leaving the 6 % who still work in rural areas to face the anger of the remaining 94 % of Europeans, who then rightly point out that a ‘philosophy" of this kind will not only cause jobs and social security to disappear for ever, but will eventually cause the downfall of the successful model which is the European Union, and which is unique in the history of Europe and the world.</p>

<p class="contents">Frankly, I cannot see what progress the Council representative was referring to. On the contrary, some of the proposals by the German Presidency have not exactly given us much cause for hope, not to mention the decision to resort to the unusual mechanism of presenting them in the name of the German delegation. I do not know if that is what the Council representative calls a happy medium.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps the most worrying thing is the confusion that exists, with constant changes of direction and a lack of impetus from those who are supposed to be in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has the right, not to mention the duty, to demand that the debate be more focused. We must remember that what we are discussing is how to finance the European Union until 2006 and how to reform the Structural Funds and common policies in the light of enlargement. The debate is not about determining how a specific country might pay less, but rather how to finance a range of common policies in a fairer and more effective manner. The aim of this is, of course, to create more jobs and reduce inequalities. In my view, the Presidency would do well to set aside the debate on net fiscal balances and look for solutions to its problems that keep faith with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think I have to remind you that the final agreement requires consensus. In other words, the automatic application of the system of majorities leads us to a dead end, to failure. And nobody – I would imagine – wants this Presidency to be remembered as one that failed. It is up to the German Presidency to put forward proposals that bring us closer to a final agreement, that accommodate the different interests involved, but that also set out a future objective of integration that all the people of Europe can identify with.</p>
<p class="contents">The European elections in June will allow us all to measure our representativeness through the exercise of democracy. Only then should the Council propose its candidate for the Presidency of the European Commission as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>

The least that can be said, unfortunately, is that the Berlin Council is not part of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question of a more social, more democratic Europe, nor of a Europe of solidarity, as budgetary discipline and reduced contributions for some – and not the least important among us – are at the centre of the debates, and this at a time when we are preparing for enlargement. This is very worrying, as any rejection of the notion of financial solidarity in Europe can only favour increased globalisation, dominated by American ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that there now seems to be movement on the question of cofinancing agricultural expenditure, demanded by some and rejected by others, including France. I welcome this, without being entirely reassured. In order to arrive at an agreement which is global, positive and acceptable to all, we must move beyond complicated calculations and develop financial solidarity on new bases in order to promote economic and social cohesion, which is under pressure from unemployment and growing poverty. The ceiling of 1.27 % must therefore remain so as to respect the constraints of the stability pact, although it would be better to replace it with an employment pact and find new sources of finance, based on a corporation tax or a capital gains tax, for example. To arrive at a more balanced budget, the share of each Member State must be in proportion to its share in the Community"s GNP. A limit must be placed on farming subsidies and they must be designed to be of more benefit to small and medium‐sized farms, as well as to employment.</p>

I have something to say on one point which may well be important for the negotiations. Tomorrow, when the House votes on Mrs Haug"s report on own resources, it may pronounce itself in favour of 50 % cofinancing in agricultural policy. In view of both this decision tomorrow and the forthcoming elections, I think it is absolutely essential that we do actually have all the alternatives on the table for the final showdown.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that cofinancing of agricultural policy is actually the right way forward. It may not be accepted because of opposition from individual countries, but it is the only approach which leaves the way open for a genuine structural policy for rural areas. Should there not be a move towards cofinancing, however – which is of course likely – then we need, in any case, to develop corrective mechanisms or capping systems which come as close as possible to meeting the desired objective. I would like a scheme, a capping system, which, once we have taken the first step, will inevitably lead on to further reforms. Were we not to succeed in doing this in the negotiations, then in my view we would be faced with a complete disaster on the first day of enlargement, because we all know that step‐by‐step reductions and capping alone are not much help to us when the question we really need to answer is how to restructure agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that the real problem with agricultural policy does not lie in the agricultural policy of the 15 present Member States, but in the agricultural policy of those who are to join us, because that is where the heartland of European farming is to be found. That is why I would emphasise once again that it is important for absolutely all of the alternatives to be on the table. Only then will it be possible to find a genuine compromise, which the German Presidency can then pull out of the hat with the kind of flourish which people like to see at a summit of this sort. For this I hope you have a good hand!</p>

I think that will go down as the understatement of the day. Quite clearly the Council and Commission have been able to make no progress in the whole area of the reform and everything that goes with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody talks about reform and says that reform is needed and required. I think we all accept that change is always necessary and we have evolved with that change. What I want to make very clear to both the Commission and the Council here today is that if they are going to have reform it must not be at the price of destruction of our rural communities throughout the European Union. There is a grave danger as we go forward that is what will happen. We must defend European Union farmers against the threats of the Americans and everyone else in the world who want to destroy the European agricultural industry. If you destroy the European agricultural industry you will destroy vast parts of the whole rural community and the whole infrastructure throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform will be like all the reforms in the past. It will not save one ECU. It will not save one D‐mark or one pound. In fact, by the time it is finished, it will cost more. The real truth is that the time has come for some of these countries who have benefitted very well over the past years from membership of the European Union, and who tell us that they are great Europeans, to begin to delve into their pockets and pay their way. I think that is the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted with interest President Santer's comment that he will take note of certain specific situations within the European Union. I hope he will do that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Le Pen </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Jacques Santer and the European Commission presented Agenda 2000 in July 1997 with a view to preparing for enlargement towards Eastern Europe, they did not think that they would be jeopardising Europe"s cohesion, and the Franco‐German axis in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that just a few months before the European elections, national concessions are difficult to win amidst this vast bargaining process of European reform. Germany is both judge and interested party as for six months it is presiding over Europe"s fate while at the same time itself demanding a substantial reduction in its contribution to the Community budget. But it is finding it very difficult to impose sacrifices on its partners, each one being more or less agreed to support the idea of stabilising expenditure. Even the euro is showing signs of weakness against the dollar, proof if ever there was that a single currency is not something which can be forced upon us. Of the three reforms included in Agenda 2000 – reform of the CAP, reform of the Structural Funds, and the review of the financial perspective for 2000‐2006 – only the first has been discussed at length by the ministers, and the only tangible result is that Germany has abandoned the idea of national cofinancing of direct subsidies to agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">In these difficult negotiations, France has made two enormous mistakes. First, it put its cards on the table much too early, the others keeping their joker for the end of the game. Also, it is very dangerous for France to try and reach agreement on the CAP without reforming the Structural Funds and Europe"s future financial framework since, with 23 % of the EAGFF Guarantee appropriations, it is Europe"s leading agricultural nation and most vulnerable to budgetary restrictions. Do we blame the United Kingdom for defending the annual rebate granted to Mrs Thatcher in 1984, or Spain, Portugal and Ireland for defending the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds, or Germany for defending a reduction in its contribution, or Italy for defending the system of own resources, in particular VAT, which is to its advantage? We certainly do not.</p>
<p class="contents">The France of Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin is the only one not to clearly defend its national interests, to sacrifice its farmers, its regions and its tax‐payers to the European illusion. I must say here very solemnly that the phased reduction in direct agricultural subsidies as proposed by France is a bad idea because it will lead to a further decrease in farmers" incomes, but also because these subsidies only partially compensate for the price reductions. In the name of what principles should farmers alone bear the cost of this technocratic Europe which is responsible for their extinction? As for the reform of the Structural Funds, Corsica and French Hainaut will see their regional aid cancelled, while fragile rural areas that enjoyed Objective 5b status will only receive the minimum share of a new inconsistent package.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these conditions, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin European Council on 24 and 25 March is likely to produce a fool"s bargain. In 1918, France said that Germany would pay. Times have changed. Now it is France that will pay for the new eastern Länder, for southern Europe"s infrastructures, and even for Ireland, which has a growth rate that is much higher than our own. Later, it will pay for the Eastern European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Front, which I am honoured to lead, rejects the federalist excesses of Agenda 2000 which lead to destructive free trade and reductive globalisation. We call for a Europe of nations, of peoples and of national identities, a Europe which gives renewed hope to our fellow citizens who have been exploited for the last 40 years.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCarthy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, it will come as no surprise that my main plea today is for the Council to make the effort to meet its timetable to enable Parliament to fully exercise its democratic mandate and add democratic legitimacy. But let me repeat what I believe is now coming loud and clear from our regions, municipalities and partners: those on the ground who are using these funds will continue to need funds, but they need to have the certainty and security that agreement can be achieved in Berlin. Programmes will not start on 1 January 2000, but we need to minimise delays in order not to fall into the problems and traps of the previous round of funding where late starts led to problems of underspends, delays in projects, project cancellations and difficulties in sustaining matched funding. We need to avoid this for future programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">But precisely because of these potential programming delays it is important that in Parliament's priorities the idea of transitional programmes are the same length for all objectives: six years to allow regions coming off regional aid adequate time to put into place self‐sustaining programmes by using financial opportunities of loans and venture capital. This takes time. That is why we again make the plea for the same transitional period. This will give these areas a soft landing, when they come off regional support.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I was engaged in my own tour and mini‐summit, as it were, in Berlin. I was there to speak on urban policy. I was even more convinced of the need to retain the URBAN initiative in the European Union. Across the European Union, even in areas of relative wealth, we encounter severe deprivation, and communities which are not getting fair access to opportunities. While we acknowledge the need to continue to concentrate our resources on the poorest and declining areas, some of which are in my own region Merseyside, we still have to have solidarity as a two‐way process. We have to retain the capacity to invest and support in our marginalised groups and communities which are not necessarily in Objective I or Objective II areas. The URBAN initiative is a small programme with a big impact. I make the plea that we continue to support this.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also in a northern industrial suburb in Milan. We took the opportunity to look at a steel restructuring works. You know of course, that the Resider funds will no longer be there to support these kinds of areas. They will probably not qualify for Objective II. This means that we also have to have a crisis initiative in order to enable us to support the future crisis sectors. We need an initiative to enhance our credibility and to prove that Europe is capable of responding to economic and social crisis. Which of us knows today what will be the crisis sectors of the future?</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the President‐in‐Office for the continuing support, particularly for investment in Northern Ireland. My latest visit indicated that the peace process there is incredibly fragile, but people take tremendous heart from the fact that Europe is supporting their cause. There is an imperative to continue to invest. I am pleased that the German presidency has also made a priority of support for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have partnership. The partnership principle is fundamental to enhancing the democratic credibility of the funds that we use back in our regions. I know that the presidency has accepted that partnership is a key principle. We do not want to be prescriptive. We simply want evidence that a partnership pact is going to be an operation with local authorities, with NGOs and, indeed, with the social partners. Let me commend your efforts to try to meet the timetable. We know it is no easy task to achieve a fair, equitable and acceptable outcome for 15 Member States, but a fair and equitable outcome has to have democratic legitimacy in the European Parliament. The final package must perforce reflect Parliament's priorities. I look forward to seeing these reflected in the final regulation.</p>

I also concur that an agreement, compromise or meeting of minds must be found in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be given a new lease of life on the eve of the elections and, as Mr Galeote has just said, we cannot ignore the scepticism and pessimism currently pervading Europe because of the difficulties confronting the euro: the disagreements, the uncertainties, the misguided statements being made on the stability pact, the wrangles over the autonomy of the European Central Bank and the pressure for a further drop in interest rates are all creating a climate of uncertainty and gloom at the very start of the euro's life, raising some extremely serious, inescapable problems such as the completion of institutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB President, Wim Duisenberg, recently stated in an interview that he had been asked to defend the value of the euro, our common currency, and price stability. If he is to pursue these aims single‐handedly using monetary means alone, he will undoubtedly create more unemployment. There is a need, therefore, for economic and political governance: the Central Bank can only be independent if a political government assumes responsibility for economic policy‐making. This is a matter of the utmost urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">This aspiration is not universally shared within the EU at present, nor by this presidency: this morning's speech by its representative was scarcely encouraging in this regard. The Berlin Council, and then that of Cologne, needs not only to produce agreements on figures and sums, but to focus on what is important and give centrestage to the issue of job creation – as called for by the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Ways to boost employment include the promotion of more liberal labour market policies, progress concerning Mr Monti's proposals, the exclusion of public expenditure and investment from the deficit, and fiscal policy harmonisation: none of these subjects have been mentioned this morning. A commitment is required above all to reconciling the need for a redistribution – and not a reduction – of financial contributions to the Union with the need to keep intact the policies of the Cohesion and Structural Funds, since these are geared to generating employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to hear the German Presidency confirm these commitments, and expect them to be followed up at the Berlin summit.</p>

<p class="contents">I have listened to you, Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, and I must admit that I am not satisfied, as you fail to sufficiently tackle the underlying issues, preferring to make politically correct general statements. It is not enough to say that the future of the common agricultural policy will be preserved. You must say how, and why!</p>
<p class="contents">We all know, President Santer, that we are facing a budgetary problem. The question here involves the CAP"s future share in the budget. Faced with planned price reductions, the Commission"s proposals increase direct subsidies to farmers. This partial compensation will lead to a progressive and steady fall in the incomes of European farmers. And I know that statistics can be used to say anything you like. You can say, for example, that farmers" incomes have increased since the CAP reform of 1992. But in reality, Europe"s farmers have had to adapt and have been forced to increase their productivity either by having larger farms or by adopting more intensive farming practices. The 1992 CAP therefore led to the desertification of the countryside, due to the fall in the number of farmers and to an increase in intensive production systems. It seems that nobody has learned from the lesson of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, in their search for productivity, certain producers are going to have no alternative but to use genetically modified organisms, or hormones, or who knows what else.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this budgetary problem, the Commission has proposed a number of paths. First, there is cofinancing, which we reject in its present form as it will inevitably distort competition between farmers in the various Member States and cause problems for the only common policy, whose legitimacy – I would remind you – is based on the Treaty of Rome. The farmers believed in Europe because they believed in the CAP. I ask you not to disappoint them.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Commission proposals are now circulating, particularly that involving the phased reduction of subsidies of up to 3 % a year. This proposal fails to take account of the differences between the various types of agricultural production as the farmers most affected by this measure will be those who are most dependent on agricultural subsidies. I am thinking, for example, of sheep farmers and of beef cattle farmers, who will have to give up farming altogether if they do not receive a sufficient level of compensation. A phased reduction of 3 % a year, in addition to the currency depreciation, which we can now estimate at 2 % a year for the period 2000‐2006, means that farmers must increase production by 5 % a year. That objective is hardly compatible with the food and health safety of European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We are becoming increasingly dependent on the agricultural production of third countries and will no longer be able to guarantee the quality of the products European consumers buy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now faced with a budgetary problem and I understand its origins and constraints. The European Union must therefore make a strong political choice. It must give preference to those policies for which it is entirely responsible, and in which the CAP must clearly be a key component.</p>

It is not without reason that we also want, in the future, to use the Social Fund throughout the European Union to combat youth and long‐term unemployment. Unemployment is not a problem which is only confined to particular regions; it is a problem which extends across the Community and that is precisely why it would be wrong, if appropriations for the Structural Funds were reduced, to cut Social Fund appropriations outside the eligible areas by 40 %, as allowed for in Council plans.</p>
<p class="contents">If you cancel Objective 3 resources in this way, how do you expect people to continue to believe that the Social Fund is going to help to make the employment strategy, which we want so much, a reality across the European Union? In fact, we all know from past experience that it was not least the Social Fund which time and again forced Member States and regions to adopt new and innovative methods, in order, with European money, to get people back to work or indeed to shield them from unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the example of preventive labour market policy, which is today one of the four pillars of our employment strategy. In 1994, however, when the Social Fund introduced this prophylactic approach to labour market policy in the Member States for the first time, many Member States – and also the German <span class="italic">Länder</span> – fought it tooth and nail. But its success speaks for itself, and it really does show once more the significance of European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of vocational training in Italy. Without the Social Fund, the relevant measures would perhaps still not exist today. I am also thinking of the certification system for training courses which has been developed so successfully throughout Greece, and of the support provided by the Social Fund for the disabled, which has moved the United Kingdom from the bottom of the European league to the top in terms of integrating the disabled, or I might think of the school drop‐out rate in Ireland, which has been reduced by almost half. This is not just progress in terms of labour market policy; the Fund also works to create social change and makes Europe something people can experience in a very practical way in the place where they live, which also increases its acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, they can tell you a thing or two about this. For example, without the Social Fund, illiteracy here would not have fallen by anywhere near as much as it has done. Or you only have to consider mainstreaming. Here too, and this is long overdue, Europe is forging the way ahead, although – and I am under no illusions here – the path is certainly still a hazardous one. That is why we must ensure that no Member State is able to avoid implementing specific support measures for women. That applies equally to the four other spheres of intervention: measures to combat youth and long‐term unemployment; social integration; general and professional training; and preventive labour market policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, therefore, with this urgent plea to the Council: do not free the Member States from their obligation to take action in each of the five spheres of intervention of the Social Fund. Cherry‐picking does not give European added value; instead, it reinforces national single‐track approaches.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cunha </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been discussing the Agenda 2000 proposals for 21 months but never before has our debate been so specifically focused on budgetary and financial matters. The debate about the major choices facing Europe has now been overtaken by a debate about budgets and the Member States' ‘give and take", in particular the question of how much the Union's most prosperous States should pay in and get back.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is vital to assess whether one or more States are still contributing too much to the budget while other Member States, equally prosperous, are paying in too little. But once that has been established the European Union must decide to reform its system of own resources in which the only fair basis for contributions is that of relative prosperity or gross national product. We cannot afford a situation in which major European decisions have to depend on solutions being found to these budgetary matters and, above all, it would be tragic if it were the poorer Member States or regions that ended up paying for those decisions and the restoration of a financial balance.</p>
<p class="contents">On this score, I should like to emphasise three points. The first is that the Structural Funds, including the Cohesion Fund, should be strengthened, especially in the Objective I regions, for which at least two thirds of the funding should be earmarked. The figure of 0.46 % of GNP for the Structural Fund should be seen as a target but not a ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the 0.13 % of GNP necessary for funding pre‐accession measures for the new Member States must not be obtained by redirecting funds previously channelled into the weakest regions of the current 15 Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect that I would like to emphasise is that of all the reforms of the CAP that I have witnessed, none of them until this one has been a reform worked out on the hoof – in other words, any old solution, even one that is cobbled together, provided that it brings down farm spending to the level set by the Ministers of Finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we were hoping for a new balance to be struck in the CAP to help producers and crops that so far have barely benefited from it, for stronger rural development benefiting agri‐environmental and forestry measures and in particular increasing aid to the less favoured regions, what we now see on the negotiating table of the Agriculture Council are proposals for equal cuts in aid for everyone without the slightest suggestion that any attempt could be made to introduce the principle of fairness into the CAP. As if all farmers had benefited equally from it in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a solution will come out of the Berlin summit, one that will serve Europe. After all, Europe has only made progress when it has been able to demonstrate solidarity and look beyond its ambitions. If we are now going to start contemplating our navels and counting every penny to be paid in and taken out, it does not bode well for the future. The Prime Minister of my country is always saying that Europe lacks political ambition and leadership. How right he is! But perhaps I should add that this is happening at a time when 13 of the 15 governments and 11 prime ministers are all Socialists.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wynn </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the last comments were about lacking vision – I just want to make a comment about losing sight of something: the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst all our minds seem to be concentrated on Berlin, and quite rightly so, the present meeting of the Agricultural Council is a considerable distraction. Among all this we have the on‐going discussions between Parliament and the Council on the interinstitutional agreement. Let me remind Members and the Council President that without an interinstitutional agreement there is no Agenda 2000. Without an interinstitutional agreement we go back to Article 203 and Agenda 2000 is dead. It is therefore imperative that both we and the Council find an amicable solution to getting an interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The old process that we are talking about is one of compromise, as President Santer said. We have problems, especially in agriculture. Those problems are about expenditure and reform but the message that needs to be put across is that without reform of the CAP, as proposed by the Commission, we will not have enlargement. Those Member States that are opposed to reform will have to ask themselves whether they are serious about enlargement or not. Without reform of the CAP we simply weaken our position in the WTO at the next round of negotiations. We should be pro‐active and taking a lead. Without reform we will just see the United States in the key position and we will be reacting once again to everything the Americans say. Without reform of the CAP we end up with food surpluses. We are back to food mountains at great cost to EU tax payers – back to the bad old days – and none of us want to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">I need to make a comment to the President‐in‐Office which relates to what is going on with the Agricultural Council. I hope they can come to a solution but if they cannot and it drags on, then quite frankly the General Affairs Council has to start taking decisions for agricultural ministers. We cannot allow that item to jeopardise or weaken Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">On financial matters, we have the situation where Agenda 2000 is linked with agreements on future financing. I have said for quite a long time that need not be the case. It is obvious why it is the case but there is no need to link a new own resources system with Agenda 2000 and I hope that if that is a problem then we can get an agreement on Agenda 2000 and afterwards continue to look at future financing. The options proposed by the Commission on own resources are worthy of long and further discussions. The Council should not be rushed into decisions that will not solve deep‐rooted problems of such financing and we should not let this procedure distract us from getting the right solution to Agenda 2000. What we want from our side are those policies which will stimulate employment, which will build social cohesion and which will protect the environment – objectives we can all agree on. They must not be jeopardised by narrow‐minded nationalistic attitudes – and that goes for all the Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the German Presidency"s report and the way the Agenda 2000 negotiations stand – or perhaps I should say the state they are in – give cause for serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The political rhetoric and the financial perspectives are significantly out of kilter. We are seeing a repeat, on a large scale, of the complaints made at the last part‐session and, on a small scale, of those made during the Socrates debate. The Commission comes along with an ambitious proposal: it proposes more tasks, more partners and higher quality. And then along comes the Council of savings club ministers and hardly any of it is possible any more!</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a look at the figures and the proposals on structural and agricultural reform, we are faced with the same dilemma. Two weeks before Berlin, we are still a long way from the noble aims of which the Treaty itself speaks – solidarity, cohesion and the common agricultural policy. For the current year 1999, for example, EUR 216 billion is budgeted for regional policy. In the longer term, the Commission has requested EUR 240 billion and at present a whole series of Member States is offering EUR 190 billion. That cannot add up!</p>
<p class="contents">The gap is almost wider still for the agricultural funds. The President‐in‐Office spoke of austerity constraints, but obviously some see making savings as the true objective of agricultural reform. That would be a catastrophe for rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues also still need to be clarified in greater detail, in particular those associated with the phasing‐out arrangements: how much money will there be here, and for how long? Only sketchy information has been given about the Community initiatives, and we can only hope – and I am also directing this request to President Santer – that the detailed proposals will actually be presented before the end of March. You see all of this adds to the importance we attach to a fundamental question. On 1 May, the Treaty of Amsterdam will enter into force. Parliament will then have full powers of codecision for the ERDF and the European Social Fund. How are we supposed to exercise these if the texts are not available in good time?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hatzidakis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL) </span> Mr President, in the debates in Council on Agenda 2000 it is clear that there is a certain indecision. The reason for this is that there is a discrepancy between the objectives that are being put forward and the funds that are available to pay for them. We agree that there must be a policy for farmers. We agree that there must be a policy for economic and social cohesion. We agree that there must be a policy for enlargement. However, no one wants to pay to attain these objectives. But there can be no policy without money and I want to be clear on this point. Countries which contribute the most to the Community budget must know that they get a lot back in other areas, such as, for example, in increased exports to weaker Member States. The Structural Funds were set up as a mechanism to counterbalance the effects of the single market. Those who complain that they are paying too much must not forget that the budget of the whole of the European Union is currently equal to that of just one Member State, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make, firstly on agriculture and secondly on the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely clear that the common agricultural policy has created distortions, that agriculture needs to move in a new direction, and that the World Trade Organisation is bringing about a new reality. We therefore need a new CAP which can help the really weak Member States. These weaker Member States are the economically poorest countries in the European Union which will be badly affected by any partial renationalisation of the CAP. Also weak are the small producers, on whom we must focus our attention. Mediterranean products have been unfairly treated and we must not deal them any more harsh blows.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Structural Funds, this House approved the financial package which the Commission initially introduced, which is why we are opposed to any attempts to further reduce it. I shall reiterate three basic tenets expressed by the European Parliament back in November: firstly, expenditure on the Structural Funds and on the pre‐accession funds must equal 0.46 % of Community GDP; secondly, Objective 1 must have allocated to it exactly two thirds of the resources of the Structural Funds; thirdly, the Cohesion Fund must continue to support all countries whose per capita GDP is less than 90 % of the Community average. Indeed, this is provided for in the Treaties. I want to point out that, especially with regard to the Structural Fund regulations, the agreement of the European Parliament is required. It is crucial, therefore, that the Council and the European Council meeting in Berlin consider our proposals seriously.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the groups and those Members who have spoken for making this debate a very constructive one. Valuable comments and suggestions have been made and we will take these on board. Overall, I think this debate has been encouraging in so far as we agree on the objectives and also on how they should be achieved, namely to actually conclude Agenda 2000 now so that we are once again free to devote our energies to the major tasks of which several speakers rightly reminded us today – the fight against unemployment in Europe, the fight for a better environment and the fight for greater social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not what Agenda 2000 is about. All those who are critical of the fact that there was no mention of this in the Council statement are forgetting that this Council statement concentrates – and indeed had to concentrate – on the Berlin summit. Agenda 2000 is clearly defined and I warn against weighing it down with major new issues, some of which it is intended should be resolved at the Berlin summit and others at summits thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with due respect the criticism made of the way in which the negotiations are being conducted and the progress made so far. I would permit myself to tell you, however – since some proverbs have already been cited – that there is also a very interesting German proverb which states that you should not praise the day before nightfall, and you should not criticise it either. Those who are criticising the progress made in the negotiations are basing what they say on information which is passed out from confidential discussions and channelled to interested parties. The presidency knows all about this. We are very interested and sometimes also amused to see how events are reported in the individual capitals and in Brussels, obviously with the aim of making particular national interests appear in the right light and improving the starting position for representing those individual interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency"s motto in these matters is: a gentleman does not boast of his conquests! We will make no further comment on this, but will simply put in the necessary work on an overall compromise. Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference here between the way in which issues can be discussed in Parliament and how they are discussed in the Council. That is due to their different roles. Parliament can decide with majorities: in the Council, we need all 15 to agree. That is why it makes no sense whatsoever for us, as the presidency, to adopt any dogmatic positions or make categorical demands, or at any point to insist that certain conditions should be met. Anyone who does that will fail completely when they need the agreement of 15! Please try to understand that. I would be delighted if it were possible to say to the Heads of State and Government: ‘My friends, this is not actually about how much money goes to particular regions of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Italy; it is about the great European vision! Forget the issue of who pays what and who gets what for once, and think instead of our great common goals!" It would be nice if this were the case. I do not know a single European Head of State or Government who would be willing to discuss this for even a minute. It is a shame that Mr Cunha from Portugal is no longer here; I would like to advise him to say what he said in Lisbon and point out that it is not so important after all who pays what and who gets what. It is actually about the great European vision!</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that; it is to do with our different roles. Unfortunately, we cannot operate in this way in the Council. As a prerequisite for resolving the issues on which we have to agree, we have to try to reach a consensus. This consensus must encompass the financial perspective. That includes both sides, the revenue side and the expenditure side. It must encompass the reform of the agricultural policy. I fully agree with all those who have said that there are many reasons why we need a reform here. And it must encompass the future use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and of course the purpose of these funds is to put the principle of solidarity into practice within the European Union. No one is calling this principle into question!</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the points on which we need to reach an agreement, and that creates the framework within which the individual policies can then develop and within which we tackle the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word on net balances, an issue which was addressed several times. Firstly, it is wrong to think that this is a German problem. It was a group of states which, a long time ago, made this topic part of the discussions. Incidentally, all the Member States recognise this. When, if not in connection with a seven‐year financial perspective, should this subject be discussed? Now is the only time it actually can be discussed. The German Presidency is not at all happy that the issue has to be discussed now when we ourselves hold the presidency. I can tell you now, as a German politician, that we could have represented our German interests much more forcefully, much more effectively, and probably also with a great deal more success – we would have been able to secure a much better result – if we had not held the presidency at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">At one point I heard the Presidency being accused of representing its own national interests, and I cannot take note of this without giving a wry smile. The opposite is true. The reality of the presidency can be described in a classic French expression which was coined many years ago: <span class="italic">la présidence coûte cher</span> ! That also applies to Germany; we know that very well.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain determined to conclude Agenda 2000. The prospects of doing so are good, now that some key benchmark figures have already been agreed. Parliament"s support is important. It will be particularly important after Berlin for there to be very close and trusting cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. At this stage, I can only extend to you the offer of this close and trusting cooperation.</p>
