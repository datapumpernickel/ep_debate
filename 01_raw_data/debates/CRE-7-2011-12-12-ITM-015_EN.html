<p class="contents">I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security.</p>
<p class="contents">With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude my speech with three words that are the guiding light in my work and life: freedom, justice and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank the Polish Presidency and all those that have given us their support to allow this to finally see the light of day.</p>
<p class="contents">We were aware of the difficulty when the Spanish Presidency, alongside another eleven Member States, presented the initiative in January 2010. It has taken us two years. We knew that violence against women, in particular, as well as against the weak, is violence that is still considered to be taboo, one for which we don’t know the official figures for Europe and, therefore, it was difficult to demonstrate the need and urgency with no idea of the information, crime and its prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing occurred with the Directive for the trafficking of women, for paedophilia. There are no official figures: information exists that governments refuse to release, but no one doubts that human trafficking and paedophilia exist.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, a request was made at the same time to the Commission and the Council for the creation of an Observatory that could form part of the European Institute for Gender Equality or the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. At present, we have nothing more than a survey, the results of which won’t be known until 2013. Ms Reding, it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We don’t have official data, but if our information is that 25% of women in Europe suffer violence, we are talking about a serious problem; if we talk about 2 500 women that have been killed, we are talking about a serious problem. Can we know how many women file a report in Europe? How many have access to a protection order? How many are killed? Can we know how many human beings, how many children are the victims of violence in the terror that occurs in the household?</p>
<p class="contents">It is so difficult to convince the Member States, but at least we have this Directive here today. We will all ratify it after a long process, during which a lot of resistance has been overcome. If we were in the commercial rather than the civil and criminal domain, the solutions would have been swift, without a doubt, but it is significant that it is the first directive created along the lines of preventative and restorative justice, and which is mainly aimed at women who are victims of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of European women have placed a lot of hope in this Directive: the women’s associations that have fought for it and those that suffer harassment and abuse, and they expect a great deal from us. It is a directive that gives victims the protection to move around freely, to avoid the ordeal of double victimisation, double procedures and double interrogations. There will finally be no borders when it comes to protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at the onset of another stage. We hope the Member States quickly transpose it. However, equally as important as the transposition, is the monitoring obliged by the Directive, the assessment of how it is applied, so that we know the reach of this first stage of this Directive. With this, we are simply starting the struggle against violence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now necessary for women to file reports in Europe, Commissioner, to lose their fear, to defend their dignity, so that they can become citizens. Not even the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union covers this torture, this killing in the private domain; this possibility is not included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The possibility of torture by state institutions is included, but not by someone who receives affection. Furthermore, this is what is terrible about these killings that occur in the darkest hours of the household.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, the real message we are delivering: that abuse does not go unpunished, that crimes could be avoided. We will have figures on the aggressors and thousands of women will be able to breathe easily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If improving procedural rights is crucial to developing a fair justice system, it is equally important to improve the rights of victims. As we raise those standards, we have to embark on balancing: on one side the rights of the accused and, on the other side, the rights of the victims in the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Commission has always supported the objectives of this proposal and why we have completed this Member State initiative by legislation allowing victims to benefit from the speediest means available for civil law protection measures as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank both rapporteurs, Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López, for their determination and flexibility and for being so helpful in finding a good solution in this dossier. I would like to stress that the contribution from the European Parliament was also very valuable in raising the general level of ambition for this proposal. That was essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring that no gaps remain in the protection of victims is equally important. That is why the legislation on a Civil European Protection Order (EPO) should be discussed and negotiated as a priority. Protection for women when they travel and go abroad is either covered under criminal law or under civil law for administrative reasons, depending on the system of the Member State. It is important to have both so that no woman will be left behind.</p>
<p class="contents">I know this is a top priority here in this House. I discussed it last week with the incoming Danish Presidency to ensure that it will also be a priority for them. I really hope that at the beginning of next year we can add to the criminal EPO the civil EPO, in order to have this needless distinction removed. You are absolutely right that this will be very important for all the victims because it will be a signal to show them that Europe cares for them, that they are not left behind and that this awful crime, which often takes place in hiding, will come out into the open. That is also why I very much look forward to our fruitful cooperation on my proposal for a horizontal directive on victims’ rights, which will complete what we have now started to do on the EPO.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning data, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur that we do not have the necessary data in order to have precise figures – as precise as possible – because very often it is a family affair that is hidden in the household. That is why I have asked the Vilnius Institute to gather and collect data on gender-based violence. The Vilnius Institute is working on this. I will come back to Parliament as soon as there are results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people are protected only in Spain, but should also benefit from protection when travelling to Romania or other Member States. According to the statistics, approximately 15% of Europeans are victims of crime, and the physical, emotional and financial consequences for victims and their families cannot be measured and recorded in terms of statistics. In Europe, the number of protection orders is estimated at 100 000, but they are valid only in the Member State which issued them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European protection order will change the limited territorial scope of protection measures taken under criminal law. The directive will enable a protection order issued in one Member State to be recognised in other Member States to which the victim travels.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I thank the rapporteur Teresa Jiménez for the dedication she has shown in her efforts and for her commitment to the protection of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank the Council for its legislative initiative and the European Commission for its legislative proposals complementing this directive with a view to recognising the protection measures issued under civil and administrative law.</p>
<p class="contents">All victims must be treated with respect and dignity and must receive protection, along with their right to freedom of movement within the Union, as a genuine area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the moment this is not guaranteed for those people – most, but not all of whom are women – who have obtained protection orders in their own countries, often with great difficulty, after being persecuted, stalked or repeatedly threatened even with being killed by someone they know, often a spouse, as Ms Reding mentioned, or an ex-husband or a boyfriend, or in any case someone they know. Such people are in fact no longer protected when they travel to another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, are seeking to fill this legislative gap by means of this directive. I would like to point out that we have applied the codecision procedure for the first time, at the initiative of the Spanish Presidency together with another 12 Member States, including Italy, and with strong support from the Polish Presidency, whom I would like to thank.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first legal instrument offering effective prevention and protection for actual or potential victims of crimes against the person or crimes of a moral nature across the European Union. It may be executed by either the civil or the criminal authorities of a country with measures that are the same as or equivalent to those taken in the issuing country.</p>
<p class="contents">As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to highlight the excellent cooperation that arose with the two rapporteurs and the invaluable contribution made by Ezio Perillo of Parliament’s Directorate for Legislative Affairs, who is today at the Court in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say how pleased I am with the key points of our proposal: the expansion of protection to cover physical and psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty and sexual integrity; the right to information; the guarantees that the perpetrator of threats will also be informed of the consequences of breaching the European Protection Order; and the obligation for Member States to draw up comparable statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I also expect Parliament to adopt a position on the Victims package that Ms Reding has announced, so as to make this focus on victim protection truly horizontal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One only has to think back to the debate we had on this important subject, already a year ago now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity of my allocated time to praise the admirable work done by our two co-rapporteurs on this very important subject, matched by their admirable determination. As other Members have said, it will bear fruit tomorrow in the agreement. We are nearly at the end of the journey, after all the obstacles, disputes and very detailed legal discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things I would like to say: this is, of course, an important day for all the victims in Europe, and I support everything that has already been said on this. They can sometimes, quite unjustly, become forgotten victims, since we talk far more often about the rights of the accused than about victims’ rights. It is therefore a great day for victims.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also a major step forward for the European Union, as not only have we been innovative in our procedure, with the two committees constantly liaising and discussing the matter with the Commissioner, but we have also created a legal instrument. This means that free movement within the European Union will be given wider scope and will be expressed more, thanks to this very valuable legal instrument, which speaks out loud and clear today as proof of, and an almost logical, natural legal progression in the process of greater European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The journey may have been long, but today we stand together as witnesses to, and participants in, a great step forward in cooperation on criminal justice and prevention. To ensure that this prevention is also effective, and that in practice we have to use this legal instrument as little as possible outside national borders, after the agreement has been made tomorrow we will need to do a considerable amount of work on information, publicity and awareness-raising. This should be directed not only at potential victims, but also at all the authorities that will be called upon to implement this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Our next step, as you said Commissioner (you will think we are never satisfied), will be to start looking tomorrow at a law on civil protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It hasn’t been easy to reach this point: it has been far too difficult. However, I first want to applaud the initiative of the Spanish Presidency in starting the process, then the joint work carried out by Ms Jiménez-Becerril and Ms Romero, from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, showing that the coordination under Rule 51 is successful, which I hope is also the case for the package relative to the victims. Finally, I should like to applaud not only the work before us, but also the challenge of showing that this is a step forward, but, as Ms Romero stated, it is simply a step forward: by no means is it the final one. Many more remain, as there is no point in the victims suffering today and having to pay even more to have the right to be recognised throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The protection of victims must not be limited to state borders, as victims often move in order to escape violence. In our common area without internal boundaries, it is therefore essential to have the possibility of also using protection measures in another Member State, and without having to commence new legal proceedings after moving in order to have the protection measures provided. I fully support the aim of this Directive, and I welcome the fact that several fundamental amendments were made under the co-decision procedure, and that the European Conservatives and Reformists Group can now support this final form. The changes I have in mind relate mainly to the area of the scope of the European Protection Order and also the legal basis for issuing a European Protection Order. I welcome the fact that the wording ensures a sufficient level of flexibility for cooperation between Member States, while securing protection measures for victims of all crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that, thanks to this Directive, we can provide protection to the victims of all crimes, without imposing an obligation to amend national Member State systems, and that this Directive takes account of the different legal traditions of the individual Member States. It would be more than a pity if this important issue, and I mean by that the pan-European protection of all victims of crime, was undermined by further unnecessary harmonisation within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to broad political and institutional efforts across the board, we have succeeded in producing an excellent directive in a constructive manner. I would like to thank everyone involved for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of a European protection order, victims who are granted protection in a Member State of the EU will now be able to obtain equivalent protection if they move to another Member State. This is important. The protection covers victims of gender-related violence, harassment, abduction, persecution or attempted murder, for example. I believe that this directive brings us a step closer to a safer Europe for all citizens, but particularly for women, who constitute the large majority of the victims, and here I am talking about men’s violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is assumed to apply only to protection measures taken in connection with a crime, but in the various legal systems of the Member States a person can receive similar types of protection with other measures, too. It is important to say that a victim of crime is guaranteed comparable protection. From the point of view of equality, the European protection order exists primarily to deal with the symptoms of gender-related violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the European protection order is one of several steps for dealing with and combating the fundamental causes of men’s violence against women. In order to take further steps, we now need an overarching EU strategy on men’s violence against women, a strategy that will then make it easier to find practical solutions for dealing with these abhorrent gender-related crimes of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We live in times where the European Union is continuously attempting to impair the sovereignty of nations. In these difficult times it is therefore very pleasing to see topics such as the European protection order come up as well. However, I would like to remind everyone that the coin always has two sides, and this, too, is a double-edged sword. We can of course use it for good causes, such as in the case of victims of crimes of usury, or prostitution for that matter. However, we should not only discuss malicious male chauvinists, but also situations where women might abuse this possibility in certain domestic conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask everyone to let us consider how we could prevent the possibility of abuse by regulatory means. After all, the institution of family is sacred and inviolable. The integrity and unity of the family stands above all else, but protection must of course be ensured. A the same time I am most pleased that one of my fellow Members mentioned the protection of children … Let me state that the protection of children and the proper punishment of paedophiles, even by the harshest means, is very important. Thank you for your attention.</p>

At the same time I also commend the Commission on turning this Spanish initiative into an implementable proposal. I believe that today’s debate marks another important step towards the protection of victims. It is true that we cannot predict how many European citizens this measure will affect and the lives of how many victims or potential victims it will make more liveable, but it still carries within it an important message, a clear commitment by the European Parliament and the European institutions to protect the rights of victims. As mentioned by the Commissioner, the first part of the victim protection package, a directive, will be approved in the near future, followed by a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The message is clear: our institutions take the side of the victims, rejecting any form of violence, while respecting the human rights of the accused in court proceedings. It is important that we prevent perpetrators from being able to pursue their victims across countries by making use of their right of free movement within the EU. Furthermore, we consider it important that we adopt the proposal in such a manner that the application of the protection order in another country entails the least possible administrative burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today is one of those days, as we will definitely ratify the first part of the European protection order, which refers to issues linked with criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s specific declaration that declares the prioritisation of the negotiation, agreement and ratification of the proposal for a Directive which will extend the application of the order in the civil domain, presented by the Commission on 18 May, completes the legal instrument we are ratifying today.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because it overcomes the main obstacle that has held up this initiative during its processing, but in particular because of the risk faced by victims throughout Europe and the measures that are introduced to protect them that are adapted to the borderless area in which we move, which is what is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The assailants, those who threaten and assault, do not understand the legal subtleties and our work is to stop them to make Europe an area of freedom, security and democracy for all. This is the message we are sending out to the European citizens today. This regulation refers to the security of individuals, of people. Extreme care has been taken with the legal system, both in resolving legal issues and in avoiding the lowering of standards of freedom, which has been the main obstacle in initiating this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I congratulate the rapporteurs for their resilience and endeavour, and I am happy that this instrument, initially developed for certain types of particularly severe violence, such as violence on women, will cover the protection issues suffered by all types of victims, in particular those threatened by terrorism or organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, in the end, that the time period available for this regulation to come into force does not expire on any Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, 12 Member States, including Italy, led the call for a European approach to victim protection and support, aimed primarily at the victims – women – of gender violence, including domestic violence and stalking, as well as other groups of highly vulnerable victims, such as children and persons with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Protection Order is an instrument based on mutual recognition in the field of judicial cooperation on criminal matters. It is also a useful system for keeping aggressors at a distance and punishing them, by forbidding them to have access to the places where the protected person lives and imposing restrictions on their contacting or approaching the victim.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this is a positive step towards achieving a European area of freedom and justice and a step forwards in terms of cooperation between Member States in order to guarantee Europeans’ fundamental rights in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is measures like this that strengthen our people’s trust in the authority of the European institutions and, for that reason, I will conclude by congratulating all those who have worked on this important dossier, especially Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López. I also thank Ms Reding for her proverbial sensitivity on such matters and above all for her practical commitment in defending women victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We welcome the initiative to protect victims of violence, which must clearly be brought to a conclusion from a legal perspective. The protective measures adopted in one Member State must be recognised, managed and enforceable. Thanks to this system, a protected person will be able to avoid parallel proceedings in individual Member States. There should also be appropriate mechanisms for preventing the repetition of a criminal act or the perpetration of another possibly more serious crime. Criminal acts are often repeated in the case of gender-based violence, although this also occurs with other forms of criminal act, such as human trafficking or sexual abuse of minors, for example. Perpetrators of criminal acts can move freely within the EU. It is therefore necessary to enable the scope of application of protective measures adopted in one Member State to be extended in order to protect the victim of a criminal act who wishes to exercise the right to freedom of movement. If this is not done, victims of criminal acts will face a tough choice between surrendering the right of an EU citizen to freedom of movement and surrendering the right to protection. That, of course, is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the natural consequence of closer cooperation between the Member States in their fight against crime is to extend the protection offered to the victims of those crimes on a European scale.</p>
<p class="contents">The European protection order, as a joint legal basis, is aimed primarily at protecting victims of domestic violence. Statistics prove how many people have been waiting for the document. My country, Poland, recorded over 100 000 cases of domestic violence last year, and this is certainly not the full scale of the problem. Many of the victims do not reveal their tragedy because of their fear of the abuser and their belief that the judicial system would not be able to provide them with efficient protection. This is why protection at European level is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the directive, victims of domestic violence will have legal protection outside their current country of residence. Protective measures such as a restraining order or a court order to leave the house which have been issued in one country will apply in equal force in another country which has undertaken to protect victims using the European protection order.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the broad protection guaranteed by this directive will be an effective and efficient way to help improve the situation of victims of violence, and will give them the opportunity of a new life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be enabling thousands of victims to fully enjoy freedom of movement within the European Union.

There will no longer be any barrier preventing these people from moving to, or simply going on holiday in another EU country. They will have the same protection as they currently enjoy in their country of residence. This European protection order says loudly and clearly that the EU protects all its citizens, inside and outside their national borders.</p>

The European Parliament has been working very credibly to combat violence, and particularly violence against women, for many years now. To this extent, the initiative started by the Spanish Presidency of the time for a European protection order fell and continues to fall on open ears. Scattered across the countries of the European Union there are currently around 100 000 women alone in victim protection programmes. These victims sometimes move their place of residence, perhaps to another EU country. We are currently in the process of creating a European legal area – a Europe of freedom, security and justice – as a European added value. As a system of mutual recognition, the European protection order is an important part of this. It is a matter of creating mutual trust in the national legal systems of Europe; but above all, of course, it is a matter of protecting victims of stalking – such as violence by former partners – throughout the countries of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the European Protection Order therefore also creates a need to perform an extensive comparison of protective measures in civil matters in the individual Member States, in order to achieve an equal level of protection for people shielded by an EU Protection Order. I am pleased that the European Council, in accordance with the resolution on a roadmap for strengthening the rights and protection of victims in criminal proceedings, supported the interlinking of the Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters with the Directive on the European Protection Order.

We cannot allow perpetrators of violence to exploit differences in legal systems and to pursue such victims to another Member State and to continue to harass them there. Victim protection must be the central issue – whether we are talking about sexual assaults, stalking or child abuse. Legal harmonisation would contradict the principle of subsidiarity, however, and in view of the different legal systems in this sensitive area must be rejected. Protection measures therefore need to be adopted under each country’s national legislation in order to provide victims with protection across national borders. This applies in particular to those Member States that believe they have to apply Sharia law. Domestic violence cannot be justified on either cultural or religious grounds, and that is a principle that should apply throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have broken through with a text which is legally sound and which is a great help to women in those 11 Member States where the protection order is dealt with under criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is very important that we get the other half of the work done and to complete this directive with the legislative instrument I have introduced for civil and administrative proceedings. It is also very important that we do not start giving out information to women before we have completed our work, because there is the danger that some women will think they are protected when they travel abroad when they are not. So let us complete all our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The moment we have the necessary coverage for all women who are in danger when they go outside their Member States then we should, together with the Member States, launch an information campaign, which I think will be very important. It is also one of those elements which can, I think, very usefully go into the European Year of Citizens, where we can explain to the female citizens who are suffering what we have done in order to protect them when they utilise their right to free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Gustafsson, Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that it is not enough to stop now at the protection order. We have to go a step further. That is also one of the reasons why I put the comprehensive victims package on the table, setting basic rights for victims in criminal proceedings. Here I have put emphasis on the special position of women in this procedure – for instance the right to be heard by a female police officer or the right not to meet the accused in court. Because that is the case it would also be very good if the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality could invest time in working on this victims package.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element which is going to come up during next year – and this is something we have already been speaking about for some time because it is a despicable crime – is female genital mutilation (FGM). Although we know it happens, we do not have the real figures. At the moment the Vilnius Institute is collecting data on how many women and girls there are in Europe – we are speaking about our territory here in Europe – who are victims of FGM or who could become victims of FGM. That will come up in the spring and then we should draw together the conclusions for possible action.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only the beginning of the work which we have to do in order to make Europe a safe place for women and to reduce the number of victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice.</p>
<p class="contents">So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear.</p>
<p class="contents">Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European protection order is a major step forward, establishing an effective framework for cooperation between law enforcement authorities in criminal matters. It is also a very important instrument because it touches on a very sensitive area – the prevention of crimes threatening a person’s health, life and psychological and sexual integrity, as well as the protection of people who are already victims of crime. I am always standing up for the safe and proper promotion of the free movement of people within the European Union because, having granted EU citizens the right to move freely and work in any Member State, we also have to ensure both their security and the protection of other associated rights. This is precisely why the establishment of the legal framework necessary for the effective protection of individuals is an extremely important task for us, the EU’s law-makers, and I am pleased to see that we are moving forward rapidly as we perform this task. This is also why here, in the European Parliament, in the near future we will be awaiting the Commission’s proposal on the mutual recognition of safeguards in criminal matters, which we could consider and which is necessary for the effective functioning of the European protection order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a sharp increase in numbers in the past year: even if we only look at people between 18 and 34 years of age, 14% of them fell victim to domestic violence and abuse. This is one of the reasons why it is very important for us, despite the immense differences in the legal traditions of countries as regards justice, to be able to take Community-level action in an increasing number of fields for the cross-border protection of victims, whether they are women or children. Tomorrow’s vote and the final approval of the directive therefore represent a considerable success and a momentous occasion. I am particularly pleased that besides Poland, the Hungarian Presidency, too, had a hand in this success. I can only hope that the Member States will begin the transposition of the directive into national law without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a symbolic day to remind us about the ‘ugly face of abuse’ and the terrifying numbers got more attention than usual: more women between the age of 16 and 44 die because of violence than because of cancer or traffic accidents. Every third woman is a victim of violence during her life. We have said many times before and I will say again: it is our responsibility to protect these victims! The European Protection Order is a very important step in this direction. Furthermore, victims (not ‘only’ women) of all kinds of violence will enjoy the same protection in every Member State which can contribute – via inspiring European criminal law – towards realising a European area of justice. I think the day when the regulation on the EPO is applicable (in three years) will be an important day. It may not be an international day of anything but, more importantly, it will give victims a real chance for protection – throughout Europe, an equal treatment of protection, no matter which Member State they choose to live in. This is why we are here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
