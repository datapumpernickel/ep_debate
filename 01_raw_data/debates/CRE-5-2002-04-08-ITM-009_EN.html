<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, when someone knocks on Europe’s door, fleeing violence, war or civil war, that person is a refugee under the terms of the Geneva Convention and is applying for asylum in the name of fundamental human rights. That person cannot, in all honesty, be told that he or she has got the wrong street or the wrong house and that it is not here but somewhere else, somewhere in another country, whose name someone will give them, if they insist and insist and if they ask...</p>
<p class="contents">It is to put an end to these and other situations that we frequently see in Europe that the Commission has drafted this timely proposal for a regulation, a type of road map for the right to asylum, which states, for each situation and specific case, who must provide an answer and where, which country must examine an application for asylum and, when all is said and done, what door will open to the anguish of a refugee who wants only to see someone with whom they can speak.</p>
<p class="contents">The very nature of the problem explains the scope of the initiative. We will not be resolving the entire asylum issue, but we are certainly taking a step forwards. As rapporteur, I take pride in having done everything I could – and my conscience is, therefore, clear – to ensure that this initiative would be approved, supporting the Commission in the fight that it will still have to engage in with some Member States. Not many, I hope. I therefore wish to thank the Members of this House and my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and most particularly and with great feeling, Mrs Eva Klamt, the draftsman, without whose effort and understanding it would have been extremely difficult for us today to hope for the approval of this Commission initiative. Thank you very much, Mrs Klamt.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, Mr President, that we have been lawlessly adrift in a sea of good intentions. There have certainly been laws, ratified by those countries that want to, and which apply in some places and not in others; some doors open and others close, and it is this murky area in which a little law is mixed up with no law at all that gives rise to dubious dealings, tricks, skilful manoeuvres and escape from the authorities. And this is how illegal immigration and the organised networks start, with the growth of mafias and crime, involvement in which is inexcusable but which is only possible because States, consisting of well-intentioned individuals, have never agreed on minimum standards for actually making one State responsible for examining an asylum application.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is a brave one. First of all, it guarantees that an application will actually be examined; it will prevent the confusion caused by multiple applications and refugees being left in limbo, and subjects these laws to its own vigilance and to monitoring by the Court of Justice. Basically, it is grounded in the principle that each Member State is responsible for the illegal entry or stay of a candidate for the right to asylum in its territory, thereby forcing each State to improve its mechanisms for combating illegal immigration. This responsibility, based on objective facts, can only be overridden by additional criteria concerning the importance attached to family group unity. Consequently, minors accompany the asylum application of the adult and unaccompanied minors are transferred, according to the wording that I propose, to a State where they have any relative willing and able to look after them. Similarly, entry or residence criteria can be dispensed with in order to guarantee the unity of the family group when one member has already applied for asylum in a given Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, what we are looking at in the initial proposal and in the feasible amendments, and whatever the result of the vote on these may be, is the broadest possible concept of the family: it covers marriage and de facto unions, where the law of any State recognises such arrangements. This would eliminate discrimination on the grounds of gender, recognising a family link for elderly relatives and minors and extending it to other children and other relatives where it can be proved that they lived with or were dependent on a successful applicant in the country of origin. And also, for humanitarian reasons to do with health or other matters, the asylum applicant can, according to the wording approved in my report, go to any relative as long as the State in which the application is made accepts this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the important thing is to ensure that the application for asylum and the refugee who makes this application are given an answer and that the European legal system serves the rights of applicants and Member States’ obligations and prevents a lack of legislation leading to an upsurge in racism and xenophobia. This initiative ensures that we will meet these three objectives and, therefore, I believe that it will be endorsed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next, I would like to point out, in a spirit of realism, that the Member States have often chosen to forget a very simple but obvious fact: that throughout history, no matter what the geographical circumstances, no barrier has been able to prevent people in search of refuge finding a way to cross the border or the barrier itself. I feel, however, that this report does justice to the problem and seeks, first and foremost, to find a sufficiently sound solution, not least with a view to finding a better alternative to the Dublin Convention itself. This is therefore an important contribution which will undeniably improve on the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, with regard to the current situation, the report seeks to find a balance between two conflicting requirements: on the one hand, it attempts to prevent abuse of asylum procedures and, on the other, it attempts to provide effective access to the procedures for determining the refugee status of those who genuinely need it. At the same time, there are new criteria and new derogations that we welcome, aimed particularly at preserving family group unity in one Member State. The same applies to the responsibility placed on a Member State which does not take effective action against the illegal presence of third-country citizens on its territory, making liability equivalent to that of a Member State which fails to control its borders properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that the Council must introduce a ‘fair and efficient’ asylum procedure and a ‘clear and workable’ method including these new provisions on the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we welcome, in particular, the fact that Article 27 of the regulation, Mr President, bans any discrimination based on sex, race, skin colour or even age, a criterion whose introduction we feel to be necessary and particularly progressive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted this report by a large majority and thereby confirmed the rapporteur in his views. The Commission proposal represents a perceptible advance on the Dublin Convention and is thus an important step towards the establishment of a common European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important innovations are:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the emphasis laid on the responsibility of the individual Member States when such Member States permit persons who have entered them illegally to remain in their national territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the adaptation of the procedural time limits to the time limits for the granting and revocation of refugee status, ensuring that applications for asylum can be processed speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the introduction of provisions aimed at maintaining the unity of the asylum seeker's family.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedures for determining which Member State is responsible are also intended to serve the purpose of sharing burdens fairly. The making of the application in a specified Member State must not, therefore, create a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>; that is, it must not determine responsibility. This requirement is taken into account by the measures intended to simplify procedures and simultaneously speed them up, while maintaining the principle of responsibility, as does the planned less onerous burden of proof when determining which Member State is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">It was thanks to a compromise with the rapporteur that we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were able to adopt a report that disregarded impractical and unacceptable amendments. This opens up the possibility of the Commission, Parliament and the Council finding together a rational way of deciding on the responsibility of Member States in asylum matters. The excluded amendments, which envisaged a widening of the family circle and the deletion of essential parts of the Regulation, were now reintroduced. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejects these amendments, particularly as regards their indiscriminate extension of the family circle, which would include, for example, dependant family members outside the nuclear family.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, when we vote tomorrow, we should give a clear rebuff to the idea of deleting essential parts of the Regulation. Let me repeat: the Commission proposal is realistic and balanced. It offers an array of improvements in comparison with the Dublin Convention. There are no grounds for trying to recast this draft in a form that will, at the end of the day, benefit neither the applicants for asylum nor the Member States. Thank you for your cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must remember that we are saying to refugees that only one country of the European Union is going to consider their application for asylum. This is equivalent to saying that fourteen of the fifteen European countries are not going to appear on the relatively short list of democratic and prosperous countries in which a persecuted citizen can legitimately request asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this gives the countries of the EU and the Union itself the serious responsibility to offer, in exchange, firm guarantees of security to these people in various respects, which must take the form of respect for them and their families, the rapid adoption of a decision which is favourable to asylum seekers, the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and guaranteed access to justice for those people, with a view to referring that decision to the State responsible in order that their case may be re-examined.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this proposal is a necessary step, which requires others in order to make full sense. I believe that we can state that this House must support this proposal so that progress can be made in the direction indicated previously. We can see that the European Council has problems making progress with this harmonised and European asylum policy and that it finds it difficult to take these steps and I believe it is very important that tomorrow this House gives strong support to the proposal in the way I have indicated so that, amongst all of us, we can urge the Council to assume the responsibility it accepted in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as the rapporteur has said, my group and I are going to ask for this report to be approved with the amendments which have already been approved in committee and with a few of those that will be tabled in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, it is only ten years since the atrocious killing and massacring of innocent people was begun in the middle of a Europe which we had all promised would never again see mass graves containing desecrated corpses. That was not to be the case. Mass graves are being found today and the remains of corpses identified. I myself saw the remains of 500 people laid out in a line in industrial premises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, never before have the EU’s shortcomings been more evident. When the refugees began streaming in, the EU acted slowly and was completely powerless to act. What was lacking was a common approach. Mr Marinho’s report, like the Commission’s proposal, is therefore extremely important. I want to praise the rapporteur for the work he has put in and for the sensitivity he has shown.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party accept the basic principle contained in the proposal, relating to the way in which asylum seekers are to be regarded, how the issue is to be dealt with and what exceptions there are. However, we wish to make the rules more predictable and to increase the consideration given to the wishes of the individual. A number of the proposals were also very properly accepted by the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention a number of important points. Increased account must be taken of individual wishes concerning the country of asylum. These are people we are dealing with! The rules determining which country is responsible must be characterised by the rule of law and by predictability. In the case of an asylum seeker who is still a minor, a person other than a relative and who has close links with the minor must be able to obtain custody of the child if it is in the latter’s interests. The country of asylum responsible can therefore be decided in terms of such factors. It must be possible for asylum seekers who have family members in a particular Member State to have their applications examined in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Appeals concerning which country is responsible for examining the application must have a delaying effect so that asylum seekers are not moved to another Member State during the waiting period. It must only be possible to release personal data concerning asylum seekers to the Member States concerned and not to all the Member States, as proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to highlight especially Amendment No 12, which Mrs Klamt also touched upon. It is our view that partners and cohabitees, irrespective of gender, should be counted as family members in Member States which treat unmarried and married couples equally. The Commission is unclear about this point, and clarification is needed in this area. It is my hope that the House will be able to support this proposal tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Vitorino. In my view, the type of abuses that go on at Sangatte near the Channel Tunnel, with people shunted about and responsibility divided between different Member States, should be rendered impossible by the proposal you have produced. What are you doing to ensure right now that there can be no repetition of the events at Sangatte? What are you doing, in conjunction with London and Paris, to ensure that this proposal can become a reality straight away? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, part of the answer to that last question would be that, if there was a legal method of entering the UK to claim asylum, a lot of the problems would be solved at Sangatte. In dealing with the Marinho report before us, however, my group has criticised the Dublin Convention for a very long time for a number of reasons, not least because to us it mixes immigration controls with the claiming of asylum, and the two things are not necessarily the same at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that people choose a particular Member State as their country of destination for a large number of reasons. It may be a country they have heard of. They might have family links there. There may already be a considerable community of people from their own region in the area. The country might have a reputation for dealing fairly with asylum seekers rather than treating them as potential criminals and keeping them restricted. It might offer work opportunities. It might be because of former colonial ties. There might be a language link. There are all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">There is extensive research showing that asylum seekers settle better, enjoy better mental health, acquire the language of the country of residence more quickly – especially the children – if a number of the above conditions apply. But we know that asylum seekers generally want to contribute to the societies that admit them and do not want to feel like unwanted jetsam condemned to live on charity and tolerance. Positive motivation, then, is extremely important to a successful asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, Dublin seemed to be based on the premise that the first 'safe' country was good enough. It was also based on the premise that the government then had a duty to deal with those asylum seekers and effectively keep them there. We know that there have been all sorts of problems, both administratively and in terms of human rights, as a result of the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposals at least recognise the importance of the family, even if the criteria for definition of 'family', does not go far enough; my group has tabled amendments because we do not believe that the nuclear family is the only viable model. However, the proposals are still based on the premise that a Member State is somehow answerable to all other Member States for their failures to control entry and borders. Not surprisingly, countries with extensive sea or land borders close to countries of origin will be the major points of entry and are thus expected to bear the major responsibility for asylum seekers, bailed out presumably by the refugee fund.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does not agree with this approach which is why we have tabled amendments designed to de-link immigration controls from dealing with asylum applications. If we are really fulfilling the duty that Mrs Terrón i Cusí spoke of and we are creating a high-standard, effective and fair common asylum policy – which sometimes I doubt – then the positive factors determining the country where the application is lodged can only act in an additional positive way. If we are not creating that, then people should have the right to choose where they seek asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I find the amendments tabled by the Greens and others absolutely unacceptable and counterproductive. If accepted, they would bring about the rejection of the whole report, and so I hope that it will be the original report that will be supported, with the Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also tell you why in a few points: You Greens want to extend the concept of the family as far as it will go, far beyond the nuclear family and to the point of including de facto family members and friends. By doing this, you will only promote immigration. What this is about is help for refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">You also want to introduce options for applicants for asylum, so that they will be able, as it were, to decide for themselves in which Member State the procedure is to be dealt with. By this, you are offending against the principle that the first Member State with which the application is lodged is to be responsible for examining it and the principle that burdens should be shared, something that we can achieve indirectly, and you would end up exacerbating the situation in countries which are, in any case, already struggling with the greatest integration problems. You also want to do away with the instruments provided by the Commission and the rapporteur to combat abuses in situations involving false or invalid documents, expired visas and so on. In doing that, you would not only be accepting abuses, but even promoting them and, with that, promoting non-compliance with existing legal standards. Under no circumstances could we accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in addition to that, you make all appeals have suspensive effect, you would thereby be hindering speedy and sure decisions and good solutions. In this House, as in the committee, I can definitely tell you once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the Commission proposals and those made by the rapporteur. If, though, your amendments get a majority, or if even just one of them does, we intend to vote down the whole report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His guiding concern was, unmistakably, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. He has taken very seriously the task enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. I only hope that we will all do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it right to speak at length about the Member States' responsibility in receiving applications for asylum and about which Member State should process them. All this not only benefits the EU's citizens, but also the refugees, who then know exactly where they stand. The increased threat of terror and the general rise in movements of refugees worldwide mean that we must at last give people a clear picture of what possibilities there are for them in the European Union. It is therefore right that we should give careful thought in this draft Regulation to what is meant by families joining their head, and make this quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very much the right thing to help bring families together, and it is important that this should be done. Both these things contribute to a coherent policy on asylum. We want every State to have the right to act in accordance with its national legislation, but this is not meant to stop anyone learning from other Member States. We want to share in granting asylum and preventing abuses. Not everything has to be the same from one State to another; we should be learning from one another how to protect refugees and how abuses can be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for us now to be discussing the apportionment of responsibilities among Member States is that the first candidates for accession will be joining the EU in the foreseeable future. One thing is clear, namely that the EU must, as far as possible, have its policies on internal affairs, asylum, and immigration well in hand before the new members join. We cannot face the new members with an incomplete asylum policy. Much in the accession process will be difficult enough for them. It is now, even before the first new States join us, that we need to create rules across the EU on precisely what Member States' responsibilities are towards refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">If we manage to get all the Member States to adhere to common rules, our work on this report will have given the project of an enlarged European Union and a common judicial area greater certainty and more success. This proposal for a Council regulation gives us the chance to evaluate our experience of the Dublin Convention and let it have an influence on new legislation. I hope we will all succeed in doing that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is certainly necessary to improve the workings of the Dublin Convention and to transpose it into European Community law, with European Court and Parliament oversight. We must stop the problem of refugees 'in orbit'. Asylum seekers are not parcels to be passed around: they are real human beings who may or may not be entitled to humanitarian protection but, in any case, need to be treated with respect and dignity. Most will be exhausted, many disorientated, frightened or frail.</p>
<p class="contents">It bears repeating time after time that the chief responsibilities of Member States are to process asylum claims expeditiously, to rapidly integrate those who are accepted and to remove those who are not. This does not mean cutting corners since cases decided sloppily or unfairly risk taking longer in the end because of appeals. This is not, in turn, to challenge the right of claimants to make appeals. One of my group's amendments would make appeals have suspensive effect. If they do not, and the claimant is transferred, they will not be able to keep in contact with the procedure or their lawyer, which is unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group also aims to further strengthen the provisions on family unity. One of our amendments would give greater rights of reunion to unmarried, including same-sex, couples. We are also sympathetic to the amendment from the Green Group, although I fear that this has less chance than ours. There must be further progress by a convergence of family law developments at national level, and EU immigration and free movement rules, in recognising unmarried partners as family, especially, but not only, those in registered partnerships. I very much hope the Socialist Group will support the very reasonable ELDR position.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the motivation of those wanting individual choice of the applicant to be the determinant of where an asylum claim is processed, rather than the State responsible for entry. But, alas, it cannot be feasible until there is a fully functioning common asylum and immigration system in which there are no artificial distortions influencing that choice.</p>
<p class="contents">It also confuses asylum with immigration. The asylum system is based on urgently needing protection. If it is determined exclusively by choice of destination, we risk ultimately undermining its integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal has a clause which would oblige a Member State to take responsibility where it had knowingly tolerated people illegally on its territory for at least two months. This would cover the Sangatte Centre near Calais. I urge the French Government to recognise the logic and imperative of this, though I understand they are resisting it in the Council. We are going to have to face up sooner rather than later to the need to have an immigration route as well as an asylum route into the EU, as well as tackling the traffickers. But the situation at Sangatte cannot be allowed to fester. The Centre cannot be closed: that would be inhumane and just displace the problem. But it is disruptive and dangerous and the UK needs to recognise that this is its problem too. There must be a bilateral solution, urgently required, supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that its greatest merit is certainly the great flexibility it gives the Member States in allowing them to apply part of their national legislation and part of the Community legislation. However, it could be said that this directive is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted. In many countries, particularly Italy, indeed, this type of action has been in use for a long time now in the face of what is in fact a genuine immigration crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I feel that, once again in a debate of this kind, not everyone has a clear understanding of the distinction between the three types of asylum application and therefore between the persons lodging the applications: in actual fact, there are political exiles, refugees fleeing emergency situations and the usual immigrants seeking work. Clearly, these are three very different cases and the solutions needed to regulate these situations will therefore also be very different.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive also refers to ARGO and Odysseus: two programmes, father and son, with the same goal, programmes which combine – successfully I am glad to say – legality with a rigorous approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard some decidedly excessive views expressed in this debate. Someone even went so far as to say that we could move towards a police state. Quite frankly, this is not so: I heard no such fear was expressed in the debate before that. However, it must be said that if a rigorous approach means not a police state but, first and foremost, a guarantee of the proper implementation of procedures for granting asylum; if being rigorous means first and foremost distinguishing between irregular immigrants and illegal immigrants and criminals, distinguishing between honest immigrants and drug smugglers and slave traders, well then, if this is the case, I welcome the rigorous approach, a carefully considered rigorous approach; not least because the well-meaning people have nothing to fear from us being rigorous and asylum seekers will receive only a welcome, understanding and help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal that we are debating here today is part of the dynamic of establishing a common European asylum system based on the full and broad application of the Geneva Convention, which is intended to create a clear, more simple and workable method, for determining which State is responsible for examining an application for asylum submitted in a Member State by a third-country national in the context of an asylum process that is intended to be fair and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal lays down innovative provisions that are designed to end a process that has proven to be extremely slow, by stipulating shorter deadlines for procedures and making them more effective by improving cooperation between Member States, attempting in this way to create a system that is fair and humane for asylum seekers, which is of the utmost importance, not only for asylum seekers but also for the Member States themselves. Also by creating a uniform set of regulations, directly applicable throughout the European Union, thereby guaranteeing that each and every request for asylum is actually examined, and at the same time preventing multiple applications being made in a number of States.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the efforts made by the rapporteur, Luís Marinho and by Eva Klamt, who have sought to produce a text that is balanced and which fulfils the stated objective. What is needed now is for us all to work together to prevent woolly amendments being adopted that could negate the balance of the text reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to feel powerless faced with the fact that so many people need this protection, but also faced with the inability we have in many quarters to integrate asylum seekers and immigrants into our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very important question, and I therefore wish to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Marinho, for all the work he has put into this report. I also wish, of course, to thank the Commission for its proposal. I want to emphasise what Mr Marinho said about how important it is for the Member States to take this issue seriously now and to exchange words for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal concerning responsibility for asylum applications is a small, but very important, step in developing a common asylum policy in the EU. In spite of the Schengen Agreement and the removal of borders within this area, there are big differences between the Member States when it comes to the ways in which refugees are received and to asylum seekers’ ability to obtain residence documents. It is therefore especially important to asylum seekers themselves that there should be a shared approach to receiving refugees and to processing applications. It is therefore gratifying that the EU can now go a step further than the Dublin Convention did. Shorter processing times reduce the risk of lengthy waiting periods, with all that these entail in terms of uncertainty for asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for strengthening the rights of children when it comes to their own families are especially important. Children who are left alone to flee from war and oppression must receive all the support we can give them. An important contribution to this is the extended concept of the family which we now have the opportunity to take a decision on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to point out that it is important that we have respect for the choices people make as to their family circumstances so that, in this area too, we try to put different forms of partnership and cohabiting on an equal footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There may, however, be a danger that we will not be improving the situation, but destroying what has been achieved. There have to be clear rules regarding which Member State is responsible for examining any given asylum application. When dealing with applications it is important that the deadline is as short as possible. The more efficient the European system is, the better for all concerned. It is not right that genuine asylum seekers should have to wait around for a long time for their applications to be dealt with solely on account of bureaucracy. Member States must be able to handle applications for asylum and requests for reception more efficiently. One month is the absolute maximum in humane terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The custody of minors is not always a straightforward matter if the biological parents are unable to take charge themselves. It is not necessarily a good thing for the child either if just any relative can volunteer to take charge of him or her. This could also aid unlawful entry and thus also jeopardise the interests of genuine asylum seekers. The concept of custody must be clearly defined. There are great differences between the south and the north regarding the notion of family. What is the nuclear family? Is it the parents and children, or all possible relatives extending as far as second cousins? The debate on the directive on family unity is still continuing; it is therefore unreasonable to define what constitutes a family separately in each directive. The directive on family unity must be swiftly implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation to replace the Dublin Convention with an instrument of Community law is, as laid down by Article 63 of the Treaty, part of a series of measures requested at Tampere and which includes, in addition to this regulation, three proposals for directives on, respectively, common minimum standards on asylum procedures, common minimum conditions on the reception of asylum seekers, and the admission criteria to refugee status or on subsidiary forms of protection and the content of the refugee status. Before these proposals were drawn up, broad consultation was carried out, on the basis of the working document issued by the Commission services, in conjunction with the Member States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental organisations. Thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, whom I would like to congratulate, the European Parliament will also contribute to this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that if we worked within the framework of a single, fully harmonised asylum system, the most practical solution would perhaps be to recognise the responsibility of the State in which the application was made. However, we do not have this single system. We are currently working within a framework where harmonisation is based on common minimum standards. We must acknowledge the fact that since harmonisation is, at present, very limited, the most practical and most effective solution is to accept that the State responsible for the entry of refugees onto the European Union’s territory must be the State which has the final say on the asylum application, and this must be done in a spirit of solidarity and loyal cooperation. The Commission’s proposal is therefore based on the same principle as the Dublin Convention. The responsibility for examining an asylum application lies with the Member State which played the greatest part in the applicant’s entry into or residence on the territory of the European Union, subject to exceptions designed to protect family group unity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge, however, that the Dublin Convention has not had the effects that we anticipated. We must take on board the lessons of the past. That is why the proposal includes a number of innovations, such as new provisions emphasising each Member State’s responsibility vis-à-vis all its partners in the Union when it allows illegal residents to remain on its territory; much shorter procedural deadlines to ensure that applications for asylum are processed rapidly in the interests of genuine asylum seekers, and so that applicants will not have to wait too long before they receive a decision on their asylum application; extended deadlines for implementing transfers of those concerned to the Member State responsible so as to allow for the practical difficulties arising in connection with such transfers and new provisions aimed at preserving the unity of asylum seekers’ families, in so far as this is compatible with the other objectives of asylum and immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Mr Olle Schmidt’s question, first of all, this allows for the existence of clear rules on the responsibility of the Member State; secondly, it gives clarification, which has been added to our proposal, on the standard of proof required for determining the State responsible, and finally, it stipulates rules on the subsidiary responsibility of the State which is negligent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that no system used for determining responsibility in asylum matters can claim to be perfect. As Mrs Sbarbati points out in her report for the Committee on Petitions, we have attempted to find a balance, which is fairly difficult, I admit, between, firstly, the legitimate interests of the Member States in combating the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping’ and the same individual submitting multiple applications in order to remain on European Union territory for as long as possible and, secondly, the interests of asylum applicants to have their application examined within reasonable time limits and so that they are not kept apart from their family members for lengthy periods, when there is no real reason why their application should not be examined in the same Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to accept the amendments which were proposed by the rapporteur and which, in our view, improve the text. They also make the Commission’s intentions behind this text more effective. It will come as no surprise, I am sure, when I say that the Commission is not in favour of the amendments that were inspired by another logic, which, however respectable, mar the proposal and contradict the Commission’s clear intention to draft a practical, reasonable, effective text in the shortest time span possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
