Making Europe an area of freedom, security and justice is a very ambitious objective for the EU as a whole, but primarily a very central one, promising protection to almost 380 million people in fifteen countries. This area of freedom and justice is intended, at the same time, to allay fears. If this area is to be created, we need legislation on it at European level to be very well constructed, and on this we are, step by step, making good progress, but we also have to create an infrastructure to build on if we are not to end up with a ruin and give our citizens good cause for disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before us is concerned with an important element in this infrastructure, dealing as it does with the training of lawyers at European level. Widely divergent systems and legal traditions mean that there are difficult issues to be resolved in this context. The French Government came up with an interesting proposal, which Mrs Gebhardt improved by making corrections, adding to the proposal at a number of points. It is thanks to the good cooperation of all involved that a good outcome has been achieved, one which the committee was able to adopt with only one abstention.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these amendments has to do with the legal basis; whereas the French proposal takes as its basis Articles 31 and 34 of the Treaty on the European Union, ours is founded on Article 42, firstly in order to keep bureaucracy within limits, and secondly, in order to facilitate flexible extension of the network. The French proposal refers only to judges in the criminal law field who wish to receive such training. That is not enough. Civil law is a natural part of the area of freedom, security and justice, which is not created only by judges. There is room for all professions concerned with the law and the administration of justice – such as lawyers, public prosecutors and police officers in the United Kingdom – to play their appropriate parts.</p>
<p class="contents">An understanding and acceptance of the different legal systems needs to be promoted in all these professions, or else there will be a lack of trust leading to them resisting judicial measures originating from a different legal system, even though they have to be accepted and implemented as if they were rulings originating from their own national legal system with which they are familiar. Smooth and speedy completion of procedures promotes public confidence in the area of freedom, security and justice that they are promised. What is self-evident in the business world must also become the rule in the judiciary, namely that success comes from learning more.</p>
<p class="contents">It is that success that is made certain by the Judicial Training Network, which also makes life easier for those who work with the law. That is urgently needed. What is evident from the report on Pro Eurojust's activities in 2000 is that those who work with the law in the different Member States do not always find it easy to work together efficiently, whether this be because of differences in the legislation or insufficient language knowledge in their specialised field. A strong training network would make it possible to remove such obstacles, so let us get one connected up! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The need for this was acknowledged and reaffirmed by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken European Council, who gave a new boost to the project of creating a training network. In the debate following up the initiative of the French Government, the Commission raised a series of questions of a legal and technical nature about the creation of a judicial training network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s concerns were specifically the following: first, the independence of magistrates, which must be safeguarded. Rather than imposing rigid training schemes, judges and magistrates should be given the necessary means to design and undertake this training in a flexible way. Secondly, account must be taken of already existing structures and available awareness-raising instruments, such as the European judicial network and the European civil and commercial network, must be fully exploited. Lastly, consideration must be given to the broad problem of the division of judicial cooperation issues between the first and the third pillar of the Treaty, which, in our view, requires the adoption of two identical acts, a problem which is aggravated by specific features of the opt-out protocols pertaining to Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">By supporting this initiative, the European Parliament has sought to respond to these questions, specifically this last issue of the dual legal basis. The Commission fully acknowledges the rapporteur’s efforts but does not subscribe to the ‘bridge’<span class="italic"> </span>formula laid down in Article 42 of the EU Treaty, which we consider to be disproportionate and somewhat unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the idea that the division of judicial issues between two pillars creates difficulties. We take the view, however, that the most effective way of overcoming these difficulties would be to abolish the pillar structure in the Convention on the Future of Europe. In the working paper that the Commission presented on the “European Judicial Training Network” we advocated three possible options: one is to create a training network by means of a Council act, another is to create a Community agency for this purpose and the third option is to keep the existing network operational and at the same time increase the support given to it by the Union. The Coreper of 27 June of this year reached broad agreement in principle on the third option, emphasising the importance that it attaches to the actions of the existing network and to strengthening its activities. The Commission considers that, at the current juncture, this is the formula that best matches needs and which is most likely to achieve positive results. The network has, in fact, already started to work along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has adopted the Framework Programme on Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters; the AGIS programme based on the Community framework model of activities designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in civil matters. The Commission is of the view, therefore, that we already have programmes that are able to support activities to develop judicial training in Europe, in both the civil and criminal fields, which is a particularly important objective in light of the impending enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the great interest she has shown in dealing with this initiative and on the excellent fundamental work she has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, we have managed to create the necessary legal bases to implement a whole series of measures at European level making the free, secure and just Europe we all want to see a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the Member States, meeting at the Tampere European Council, stated that, in a genuine European area of justice, it must not be the case that the incompatibility and complexity of the legal and administrative systems of the Member States should prevent people and companies from exercising their rights or dissuade them from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent this kind of malfunctioning, the Member States established, as a cornerstone for judicial cooperation in the Union, both civil and criminal, the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial resolutions and sentences. But, in order for mutual recognition to be possible, it is also necessary to comply with another principle: that of reciprocal trust. This means that, in order for foreign judicial resolutions to be accepted as equivalent to national ones, there must be total confidence in the systems, both legal and judicial, of the issuing country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, as the initiative recognises in one of its recitals, the training of the members of the judicial bodies of the Member States is one of the factors which will lead to the success of the European area of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that the initiative we are discussing is important. Its aim is to create a network which allows for the establishment of the necessary links between the different bodies of the Member States responsible for the professional training and continued training of the people responsible for the administration of justice. This will promote understanding between the different authorities and help establish a climate of trust. It will undoubtedly lead to better knowledge of the respective legal systems of the Member States and better functioning of the European area of justice. In this way, we will institutionalise a system of exchange of best practices and open up a fluid channel between the national bodies, while respecting the identity of each of them and their necessary judicial independence, which is the basis of the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on what I consider to be the most important aspect of the present initiative, which has already been mentioned by the rapporteur: the scope for action on the network. In fact, this has been the central issue of the main discussions, naturally, since it has a direct influence on the choice of legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the confused dispersal in the Treaties of the legal bases for the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, I agree with the rapporteur that it makes no sense to create a network like the one we are discussing for the specific field of criminal law. In itself, justice is a single concept and therefore the coherent thing to do is to create a single network to coordinate the national bodies for continued judicial training, both in the civil field and in the criminal field.</p>
<p class="contents">In view, on the one hand, of the opinion expressed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which rules out the choice of a double legal basis if it involves procedures which are incompatible with each other and, on the other, of the importance and the objectives of the initiative, I believe that the choice of the direction laid down in Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union as a legal basis is the most appropriate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work is based on the principle that articles are incorporated into the Treaty because they are expected to be used subsequently. In this respect, we should not be afraid of opting for this procedure, regardless of the fact that it has not so far been used. Furthermore, the choice of Article 42 has an even greater significance, since it means supporting the communitarisation of areas which are still relegated to particular procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to insist on the need to put an end to the legal dispersal and multiplicity of the legal bases for the creation of this area. This initiative will allow us to put into practice the will enshrined by the Member States in the said Article 42 of the Treaty and open up the road to the gradual communitarisation of the most important aspects of criminal law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andrews (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, as has just been said this initiative was limited originally to the training of criminal law judges, but it was recognised that a second phase would be developed to address the training of civil and commercial law judges. There is a tradition in certain Member States that judicial independence should not be encroached upon. Indeed, this is enshrined in the Irish Constitution. Therefore, an appropriate solution needs to be found as to how to carry the work forward. I am sure we can find one. We already have an independent judicial training network.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular initiative has been overtaken. I suggest that we now need to make immediate use of the existing network and to ensure, at the same time, that there is improved support for it. We really need to concentrate on the fight against terrorism which is, as we all know, national, European and global, and it is a priority for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Council's determination, together with the Member States, to play a full role under the aegis of the United Nations in a global coalition against terrorism. Terrorist attacks are an attack on the most fundamental human right – the right to life. They are attacks under the cloak of night, human bombs in crowded streets and on buses; there are always victims of terrorism, as there are victims of crime, victims of man-induced famine. There is state-sponsored terrorism and terrorism of war and retribution, as we are witnessing in the Middle East. The form of terrorism that now threatens the world has no boundaries, no identifiable location. It moves money as well as infiltrating business, politics and worldwide legal and police systems with impunity. Ireland has had 30 years of terror, which effectively ended in stalemate. We should draw some lessons from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nations, cities, towns and most of all people are the victims of terrorism. The victims are the real prisoners of terrorism; the perpetrators all too often walk free.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turco (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is thanks to the reform of the Rules of Procedure that we are here today discussing a text which – as has happened on many, too many occasions in Parliament – will be adopted by the Council in a different form from that in which it was submitted, while we are denied the chance to debate the European Union’s proposals on terrorism, which are much more important in terms of the rights and freedoms of the European citizens than the document we are now compelled to debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer, in particular, to Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report, which examines two proposals made by the Kingdom of Spain. We are going to vote on this report tomorrow without even having the chance to debate it. I am talking about texts on which the Commission itself, which is usually slow to adopt positions, has expressed convincing reservations of a legal and political nature, which are, moreover, appended to our report. I am sad to say that the major Parliamentary political groups, clearly concerned to conceal the contents of the measures from public opinion, have decided to deprive the House even of the usual semblance of a debate. This is deplorable. Thus, we are not going to talk about the Kingdom of Spain’s proposal on police and judicial cooperation to combat terrorism, a proposal which we could certainly endorse. However, the proposal to use joint investigation teams, as well as Europol and Eurojust, to facilitate such exchanges raises problems which Parliament has mentioned on several occasions: the absence of democratic and judicial control over Europol and Eurojust and their essential lack of connection to the Community; the lack of specific guarantees concerning the action of members of the joint investigation teams.</p>
<p class="contents">Such aspects, relating to investigations and criminal procedure, are in many cases codified in detail at national level as part of the Member States' legal codes or even their constitutions so as to be able to determine the rights and duties of the parties involved. All this is lacking at European level</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal of the Kingdom of Spain is also being concealed from the citizens. This relates to the mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism, which, as explained by the European Commission, is still unacceptable because it is incomplete and unspecific and its legal basis is misapplied. In other words, once again, the fight against terrorism is being used as a pretext for riding roughshod over principles and rules. Indeed, the initiative goes beyond what is authorised under the proposed legal basis and the evaluation comes on top of that already provided for under the Framework Decision on the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the Council hears what we have to say, rejecting a text which will never be approved and rejecting texts which are based on the intention to combat terrorism even at the cost of undermining the fundamental freedoms and rights which are at the heart of democracy itself. The major political groups have decided not to discuss these issues, whereas a debate is necessary and would have yielded useful results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this way, the proposal that we are studying aims to guarantee cooperation between the judicial authorities of the Member States by creating a European judicial training network, which is intended to promote the coherence and effectiveness of training actions for members of the judicial bodies of the Member States, establishing links between the national schools and institutions specifically responsible for training professional judges and magistrates.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the idea of establishing closer links between magistrates and the institutional mechanisms of European judicial cooperation, so as to facilitate the professional monitoring of the various stages of constructing a judicial Europe and thereby contributing to the consolidation of the area of freedom, security and justice and to the creation of a European judicial culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Mrs Berger to convey our congratulations to Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent work and our agreement, already expressed by Mr Hernández Mollar, with the idea that this network must cover all fields of judicial cooperation in the European Union, in other words, matters of both criminal and civil law. We will be thereby making a valuable contribution to improving knowledge and understanding of the cooperation instruments, and to promoting the development of a climate of confidence on the part of judges and magistrates in the various national legal issues. This will benefit the mutual recognition of decisions in both civil and criminal law cases, which is ultimately the cornerstone of judicial cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
