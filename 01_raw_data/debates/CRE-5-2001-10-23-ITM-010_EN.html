However, we have a unique opportunity, within the framework of the Commission communication on innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, to approach innovation in the strategy for employment, rather than solely within the bounds of the application of new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund can play a vital role in increasing employment and enhancing regional and social cohesion, the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to our strategic objectives, and we must not just make use of them, we must also take action to make up for lost time and lost resources, because the guidelines for innovative measures were only finally adopted a full year after the adoption of the structural fund regulations, which made delays in implementation unavoidable. And, apart from limited funding, resources totalling EUR 104 million have been cut from innovative measures and technical assistance in order to cover old liabilities from the previous programming period. Similarly, despite the swingeing cuts in these resources, the Commission failed to commit some EUR 31 million during the 2000 financial year and allowed these appropriations to be cancelled instead of transferring them to the following financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that the European Commission has responded to the call by the European Parliament for a new plan on the content of innovation, how it is to be managed, how the measures implemented are to be evaluated and the strategy for disseminating the results. However, we also wish to express our concern as to the efficiency of this proposal, which is vaguely worded and riddled with weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand, Commissioner, that innovation is a multidimensional, composite concept and, as such, hard to define and confine to specific sectors or lines of action. At the same time, we find that there has been no fundamental evaluation of previous innovative actions, which could have provided a basis for future planning. We also find that social partners and social agencies are lacking in experience and face difficulties in their attempt to approach this concept and design innovative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we propose that the European Commission should adopt fixed criteria to be taken into account in fixing support priorities for and selecting projects and to state them clearly in calls for proposals. These criteria are: the direct relevance of projects when it comes to increasing employment, really innovative features as regards the planning and implementation of the measure, the quality and viability of the measure and the potential for the circulation and dissemination of the results within the framework of the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is also vague on the question of complementarity. Complementarity in European policy is extremely important to the sound management of resources and their multiplier effect. The importance of complementarity is clear from this morning's debate. However, I believe, Commissioner, that complementarity should under no circumstances mean that innovative measures will lose their specific and distinctive character, nor should it mean the deletion of budget lines referring to related but separate sectors of activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The description of thematic fields is also vague, especially when it comes to the social partners. The social partners have an important role to play. We all support it but they themselves are ignorant of it. They themselves are ignorant both of the potential which European policy affords them and of the extent of their responsibility for creating a real European job market and increasing employment at local level. We need to help them, perhaps with some clearer guidelines and examples. It would be more helpful as regards the substance of innovative measures if, when defining the thematic fields for 2002 and subsequent years, the European Commission consulted the European Parliament and the Committee on the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee before announcing the thematic sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly welcome your reference, Commissioner, to equal opportunities and believe that this principle should distinguish not just how men and women are treated but also access to the policy on innovative measures by regions which lack innovation and face particular structural problems, such as mountain and island regions. If we believe that a quantum leap beyond our standard policies is needed in this sector of activity by the European Social Fund, then this also needs to be expressed in the policy for evaluating and disseminating results. We believe that the European Commission should design pioneering methods which are more penetrating and efficient than those applied to date. Setting up a special unit to manage innovative measures is a good move and we hope that it will be suitably staffed by officials who can help it carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, your efforts alone will not suffice and the Member States must not be left out of this process. The dissemination of information and technical assistance for interested parties need to be promoted through specially staffed units operating in an optimum manner at regional level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The priority objective of the European Union, as laid down at the Lisbon Summit, is to turn the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic development, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. This objective, which we all wish to achieve, demands innovative measures to integrate groups with special difficulties into the labour market. Notable in this respect is the need to maintain the objective of equal opportunities, since the presence of women in the labour market is still insufficient. The partnership between the different actors in the economy, as well as the choice of issues to be tackled, will help to achieve the proposed objective.

Precisely this defect can prove detrimental to the effectiveness of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of subsidiarity, these innovative actions are to be called into question. What is the specific added value which these actions should yield? In this respect, the communication is bogged down in vague descriptions. There is thus a major risk of the Commission backing useful actions which would also be implemented without ESF subsidy because national or local authorities have already recognised their usefulness.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there is still no assessment report on the innovative actions in the previous programming period (1994-1999) should ring alarm bells with the budgetary authority. Furthermore, the Commission has planned considerable economy measures for the period 2000-2006. Can the Commissioner indicate the reason for these measures? And can the Commissioner also explain why the assessment report is still pending, and when it will be submitted to us?</p>
<p class="contents">I share the critical tone of the report. A weak area in the report is the pursuit of a European labour market. This is still pie in the sky, given the language barriers, cultural differences and the different national systems for taxes, social security and pensions. Europe’s most important trait is its diversity, and that is why Europe cannot be compared to the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Experiences with ESF subsidies in the Netherlands indicate that it has been unclear on more than one occasion as to what can and cannot be subsidised. According to the Dutch Court of Auditors, this is partly due to the loose and opaque wording of EU legislation. Even if a conflict of interest is unlikely in connection with support for innovative actions, I still wonder if the present communication has been tested sufficiently for the risk of exploitation and improper use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is optimising the application of Article 6 and the second is having the best, most efficient relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the application of Article 6 is concerned, the unit which deals solely with Article 6 was created, staffed and started operating in December 2000. This means that we were able to focus on implementing it and we have made satisfactory progress. The first stage of the programme has already been announced with the call for proposals on the subject of adapting to the new economy within the framework of social dialogue. This was announced in February 2001. A second call for proposals on the subject of local strategies for employment and innovation is also ready and is due to be published at the end of October.</p>
<p class="contents">The first call was a complete success. A large number of transnational plans was received in which social partners, trades unions and employers, as well as local authorities and companies played a very important part. The evaluation of these plans was strengthened at the European Parliament's request and now we do not just evaluate each plan individually, we also evaluate the measures as a whole so that we can assess their complementarity. I must say that particular account was taken in the calls for proposals of the 4 points on which Parliament also focused.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as working with Parliament is concerned, I can tell you that we are about to officially submit the first report on the implementation of the previous Article 6 period which is now ready – a copy has already been sent to Mrs Kratsa through official channels – and the communication makes provision for an annual report from the European Social Fund to the European Parliament on the application of Article 6. The first of these reports is being drafted and should be submitted to you within the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are other ways of working together and exchanging more views. I think that Article 6 and its implementation could be a special item for the joint parliamentary and Commission committee on the European Social Fund, but there are other fora in which views can be exchanged. One of these is due to take place on 18 December and everyone in charge of the social dialogue plans selected will be invited. Naturally we hope Parliament will also attend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
