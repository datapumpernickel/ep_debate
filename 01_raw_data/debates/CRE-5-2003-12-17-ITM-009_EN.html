I was in my seat in good time for the start. This evening’s debate, which we are holding in the cosy circle of insiders, revolves around a technology – cogeneration – which is a recognised environmental tool. Cogeneration can be used in many different ways, from district heating, mainly in northern Europe, to production plants, as in the ceramics and paper industries in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Cogeneration, involves the simultaneous production of electricity and heat in what is usually an energy-saving process. This directive focuses primarily on high-efficiency cogeneration, namely processes which offer energy savings of at least 10%. This is one of the main reasons why cogeneration is used as a means of increasing energy efficiency and why it contributes to greater security of supply. Last month’s blackouts have demonstrated that we need to do something to improve security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by commenting on the way the Council deals with Parliament. This directive has been under discussion since September 2002 – nearly 18 months. The first reading in Parliament was very controversial. The second reading was much more consensus-oriented. Unfortunately, the Council common position accepted very few of the amendments proposed by this House. During the second reading, the Council again showed little flexibility and openness to our demands. As I see it, the Council adopted a ‘no can do’ position from the outset and we were repeatedly told that there was no scope for going beyond the common position. In my view, there were times when the way in which the negotiations were conducted was closer to a consultation procedure than to codecision. The compromise solutions were eventually adopted not because I as rapporteur was completely happy with the result, but rather because the Council put pressure on Parliament – there being no longer enough time for a conciliation procedure if the Council was to keep to schedule. More pressure was applied through the statements made by a number of delegations in the Council questioning the need for a directive promoting cogeneration, and making it clear that the directive would be blocked if Parliament requested anything beyond this support.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now tell you what I think merits praise in this directive. The aim of the directive is to promote cogeneration technologies, which can help to improve energy efficiency and security of supply. Cogeneration is now on the European Union’s energy policy agenda. The directive means the Union now has a policy on cogeneration. Europe has a harmonised definition of cogeneration, meaning that there is now a common understanding of what cogeneration is. Classification as high-efficiency cogeneration is determined using a two-stage process as defined in Annexes II and III of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, cogenerated electricity is calculated using the Prothermo method as described in Annex II. Based on this method and taking into account the results from a CEN/CENELEC workshop currently in progress, the Commission is to devise a standard calculation for cogenerated electricity and the necessary guidelines for using it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to qualify as high efficiency cogeneration, the process must provide energy savings of at least 10%, as laid down in Annex III. The Commission will provide harmonised reference values for calculating the energy savings. This was an important step forward and an important demand on Parliament’s part. The order in which Annexes II and III are applied has not been harmonised. The alternative calculation methods will therefore remain valid, and these will, if necessary, be harmonised in a new draft Commission directive. A standard procedure for issuing certificates of origin has already been provided, which is important for cross-border trade and therefore for the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are required to compile statistical data about national generation of electricity and heat using cogeneration. The Member States also have to assess the potential for using cogeneration and inform the Commission of their conclusions. The Commission is required to evaluate these reports and, if necessary, submit an action plan for developing cogeneration in the EU. National instruments and financial support should focus on primary energy savings. Legal and other barriers are to be removed. The directive establishes a definition of and a special status for micro-cogeneration. Under this directive, micro-cogeneration refers to installations with a maximum capacity of 50kWe. Micro-cogeneration operators may use certified values for calculation purposes, thus reducing their administrative burden. Member States can facilitate access to the grid for small installations and micro-cogeneration operators. Obviously we would have liked to see more on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does not appear in the directive that we would have liked to see included? There are no targets set for the EU or individual Member States, no special assistance, and insufficient support for micro-cogeneration installations, which unfortunately means there is no assistance for increasing market penetration over the next few years. There are no practical measures aimed at increasing cogeneration as a proportion of total electricity generation in Europe, and grid access for cogenerated electricity is not adequately regulated in terms of support measures. At the moment, existing calculation methods have not been harmonised – in fact, alternative methods are valid until 2010. Cogeneration powered by nuclear energy has not been excluded from the scope of the directive. The European Parliament would undoubtedly have wished for a more ambitious directive. But at least this directive establishes a common understanding of cogeneration and lays a foundation for the promotion of cogeneration in Europe. The course has been set for harmonising calculation methods for cogenerated electricity and primary energy savings. The Member States are going to have to consider the technology, because they have to evaluate the national generation capacities and potential then report to the Commission. The Commission is required to present an action plan for developing cogeneration if there is no increase in cogeneration usage.</p>
<p class="contents">This places cogeneration policy on the agenda at EU level, which represents a great success for the European Union. Let me close by challenging the Member States to report on the national potential for extending cogeneration as soon as possible, to make use of that potential, and to remove any and all barriers to increasing the share of cogeneration. I also say to the Commission that we need a new directive on European support schemes and total harmonisation of the energy market as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, let me thank my co-rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all those colleagues who have contributed, and also the Commission. I think we worked well together. In our discussions I repeatedly emphasised my understanding of a compromise as a solution that is slightly painful to all sides. I hope everyone has suffered to the same degree, and I hope that when we adopt the compromise amendments tomorrow we will have a reasonable directive.</p>

In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, and also the other shadow rapporteurs and the other MEPs responsible, who have worked intensively on this Directive which is so important to Europe's energy policy and, at the same time, so technically complex in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the promotion of cogeneration is a step forward, which is intended to help to resolve the problems faced by our energy sector in Europe, such as the need to save energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. High efficiency cogeneration means greater efficiency, since it implies energy savings and therefore reductions in emissions. We are also considering cogeneration with renewable energy sources, at a time when this helps us to increase the security of supply and to reduce the vulnerability relating to the transport of electricity, sometimes across long distances; in fact, cogeneration normally means greater proximity between the production of electricity and the demand for it and therefore brings generation closer to consumption. It also means greater flexibility in the energy supply, since, I would insist, cogeneration can be carried out on the basis of any fuel, including renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The European industry has been demanding a regulation of this type for a long time; it follows our work very closely and I believe that everybody considers what we can achieve tonight and tomorrow, in the vote, to be a good agreement – earlier Mr Glante said that ‘it does a little harm to everyone’, perhaps that is partly why it is a good agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an extremely important point, which Mr Glante has pointed out, which is that in cogeneration they are different concepts, which are hidden depending on the different countries. Thanks to this discussion we are converging these different concepts, leading us to something which appears essential: that cogeneration is genuine cogeneration and means an improvement in the true global energy balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of objectives in relation to the promotion of cogeneration has been one of the fundamental issues in the debate between the Council and Parliament, and I believe that ensuring that the Member States are prepared to determine and notify their potentials is a very important step forward, and is the correct one. These reports will have to be published and subjected to examination by all the parties involved, and I have no doubt that the viable potentials will be followed by the measures necessary to implement and utilise the potential of cogeneration for energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s amendments have clearly improved not just the initial Directive, which we had presented to Parliament and the Council, but also the common position and, in particular, on this point which the rapporteur referred to, microgeneration, a new and promising technology. I am delighted by Parliament’s initiatives to insist on this issue and to provide the modifications which allow it to be included directly into our Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also contributed to other improvements to the common position, such as the authorisation of the committee responsible for the complex technical details and adapting the thresholds of technical development, and I would like to thank them once again for the work they have done, which has demonstrated once again the seriousness and skill of this Parliament, even when we are dealing with and discussing enormously technical issues, as in this case. I congratulate you on the wonderfully high quality of your work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, all the shadow rapporteurs and the other participants in these debates for their contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that it is not only engineers who sit in Parliament but also good, elected politicians who seek to make the best of each proposal. In particular, I would like to thank Mr Glante and also Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who have been very involved in this discussion. I think we have learnt a great deal over the past few months about the technology involved, and eventually concluded that, at the end of the day, this is still a political decision. I would also like to express my thanks for the compromise solution, which received substantial support from our colleagues. I think our colleagues’ work represents an even greater achievement given the complexity of the subject matter they had to get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has voted indicates that this directive will be approved tomorrow. I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a conciliation procedure. Perhaps we could have included a few more items that way, but I consider that the main points of our general approach are already present. We wanted to play it safe and make sure we had a directive since, particularly next year, when the internal market comes out of the budgets, the directive will clearly be very important for establishing a level playing field for all market players from the outset. That is also why the relevant definitions were very important. Our aim is to improve the security of our energy supply. Obviously we can make use of micro-cogeneration, for a start. We want to see lots of market players, who will improve the security of energy supply but will also increase energy efficiency and above all – I think this was the really decisive factor – will improve grid security. The blackouts have taught us all that there is often a great difference between the electricity traded and that which is actually supplied, and consequently that we need a lot of points in the grid to provide grid stability. Residential users then have an opportunity later on to recover part of their energy bill as electricity supply. Micro-cogeneration provides an opportunity for householders to obtain more efficient and cheaper energy along with greater energy security from the energy industry as domestic users. This benefits both the public sector and domestic consumers, and we are here to work for the good of our citizens. I believe that lower energy bills will result in a healthier bank balance for every citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">A standard definition of cogeneration is essential. I think that the most important point is actually our declaration that we will accept different calculation methods, notably the CEN proposal, which we await with great interest. We have Prothermo as a basis, but the Commission should also carefully examine our proposals for calculating net electricity. This sets a standard that will, in future, be very important for everyone. Another particularly important element is the equal weighting given to producers’ own consumption of cogenerated electricity and electricity fed into the grid, and therefore to mechanical and other plants which do not feed into the grid.

Increased CHP is one of the best means to improve the efficiency of the energy economy and reduce greenhouse gases that result from this sort of generation. Let us combat emissions with science, efficiency and moderation.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Finland have a lot of good things to say about cogeneration. We are pioneers in this field. Cogeneration now accounts for a third of the electricity produced in Finland. I support the directive, as it will provide an impetus for increased generation of this type throughout Europe. The Union really must set an example in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that initiatives of this kind will also be adopted by our new neighbours as speedily as possible, so that production might also be increased in this way in the Union’s neighbouring regions. In our national strategy this path has almost reached its end and district heating plants and industrial sites have on the whole already exploited cogeneration. Our energy economy is very diverse, versatile and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The price of electricity should be lowered, and on that point I agree with the previous speaker. We realise that it is important that it should remain within the powers of decision of the Member States as to what means are used to increase common targets. We are out of step with one another within the Union in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one detail. I am in favour of the Council’s support for the amendment in the report which states that it would be the Commission’s task to assess the effects of a harmonised calculation method and propose further action to promote harmonisation. I support this approach because it must be the long-term aim to harmonise definitions employed in national objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done a lot of work to promote this idea, listened to the various parties and achieved a good end result. I heartily support cogeneration, which is an environmental and energy policy instrument for increasing energy efficiency and improving the security of energy supplies. As Mr Paasilinna just said, we in Finland have good things to say about cogeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">Producing a directive to apply to the Union as a whole is a difficult process, because the directive is a technically demanding one and circumstances and practices vary greatly between the Member States. Our group supports the compromises drafted by the rapporteur and hopes the directive will now speedily move forward. In my opinion it is important that this issue should be taken forward, albeit one step at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is very dependent on imports of energy. This creates uncertainty, and rising import ratios increase the risk of supplies being interrupted. It is essential to increase the share of cogeneration. This directive can create a framework for increased cogeneration. The Member States must jointly approve the defined criteria whereby binding targets may be achieved. Experience has shown that if targets are not binding on Member States, progress is slow.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential for cogeneration can be optimised when the various operators are aware of the opportunities that are available to exploit the technology and find compatible systems. Accordingly, it is particularly important that there is cooperation between different operators and that they can exchange information on good practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The well-known cornerstones of this energy policy are security of supply, reducing our energy bill and the preservation of the environment. Cogeneration is a very valuable instrument in terms of fulfilling these objectives and therefore this directive was timely and necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen clearly during this discussion and the production of this important legislative initiative that sometimes two interests, two sectors, are in clear conflict. In this case, the two interests to be harmonised were that of those who produce heat and that of those who use heat in an industrial process. These two interests in conflict were represented curiously by two physical parameters: the energy efficiency of the installation and the saving of primary energy. What we have done through our work together has been to try to ultimately achieve a balanced approach which establishes the foundations for the promotion of cogeneration, dealing objectively with all the interests involved in this significant activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that we have achieved this thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Glante, and of the various Members who have contributed to this objective and ultimately we have demonstrated that consensus does not always spoil things, but there are occasions when consensus, in the end, achieves a result which today we can all celebrate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to end, Mr President, by expressing my satisfaction with this achievement. We have undoubtedly taken a step forward in relation to this energy policy which we all share and let us hope that this directive will soon result in a harmonised method and a unified model for promoting cogeneration which allows us to achieve the objectives which we have all been pursuing for some time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the latest compromise proposals the directive has indeed progressed in the right direction. It is good that no national targets are being set: the approach is positive and encouraging. CHP should be promoted, as it is an efficient and natural way to produce electricity and heat. It is also important that financial support for CHP should not be restricted to electric power plants generating less than 50 megawatts. We should oppose the financial support proposed for small-scale CHP, for example by providing them with a free connection to the grid and guaranteeing prices. This would distort competition in the open electricity market which we are trying right now to create within the EU. Small-scale CHP should be supported in other ways, optionally, without distorting competition, and where CHP is a cost-effective technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Biomass should become a more frequent option as a fuel in cogeneration. It would be a way of furthering the realisation of targets related to the use of renewables and reducing emissions. Talks on emissions trading might result in the special financial support for cogeneration proving to be superfluous. It is expected that emissions trading will in any case lead to a rise in energy prices, putting a strain on users in the market as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to promote cogeneration, as it is a good solution both economically and environmentally. The agreed compromise proposals now constitute a step forward with regard to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that, as Alejo Vidal-Quadras has quite rightly pointed out, through this definition we have managed to combine and include within the concept of cogeneration the two types of cogeneration which furthermore are usually divided in accordance with European geography; that which pursues energy efficiency in an industrial process and that which pursues it in the field of the production of heat essentially associated with the task of heating in communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, we have produced this global definition, we have a positive energy balance, which means that, by means of cogeneration, these results are achieved with less consumption of energy than would be required by the production of these two activities separately. That is what we are aiming for: greater overall energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion consensus – as the honourable Member said a moment ago – brings positive results. I believe that achieving a good consensus means combining, overcoming, rather than watering down or weakening, and, as in this case, we are building and strengthening the support for this series of measures which, together, throughout this time have made up a European energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There still remains as a possible outstanding issue, the nuclear security package, on which I hope Parliament will soon give its opinion; then we will have the package presented the other day by the Council, the new energy package, which will be the third package following the gas and electricity packages, in order to guarantee greater security in this supply in a liberalised market and in order to deal with the reality of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the final plenary session of this year, the final new year of this legislature. There will be another legislature and I hope that all of you will be sitting here – if you wish to be – but I believe it is important to assess what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">We have moved on from statements on energy efficiency, cogeneration, the use of renewable energy sources – which were often wonderful and full of goodwill, but mere statements nonetheless – to taking measures with specific objectives in order to promote energy efficiency, cogeneration and the use of renewable energy sources in different areas and in different applications.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also worked in other areas, such as security of supply and effective operation of the market, issues which raise problems in relation to this vital element of energy, not to mention issues such as security in the nuclear field, which I referred to a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the honourable Members for their work and cooperation throughout all this time, in particular, on this directive, which is complex, but which I believe will have very positive effects, and I wish you a happy Christmas and all the best for 2004.</p>
