Mr Blair, you are a courageous and strong leader. You have stated your convictions and the direction in which you wish to go. I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that today’s debate should not be about whispering in the corner or blaming somebody else for what happened yesterday, but should focus upon what you said. One thing is worrying the citizens of Europe, and that is the future: the lack of jobs and answers to globalisation. The responsibility of Parliament is to support a UK presidency which said the following, ‘We have to create changes to equip people to live during permanent changes’. The question is not whether there will be changes but what kind of changes. The question is not whether there will be reforms, but what type of reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair, in my short amount of time today I will focus on that question. Your principal task internally in Europe in the next six months will be to create more jobs through higher growth and the right reforms. It is about doing these things simultaneously. I know that even if you succeed – which I hope you will – in achieving this new European budget, we know and you know that most of the effort to create more jobs takes place in the nation state. It is also the responsibility of the nation states to really focus on a modernisation process and to unite a new social progress with a new competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, as your first task internally, I urge you to formulate a new deal among governments to invest in the Lisbon process in the next four years, not because it is a requirement of the Treaty, but as an obligation to the people. If you can achieve a new agreement during your presidency on goal-oriented investments to increase growth internally, combined with some consensus on the social model, then you are in the driving seat and I sincerely hope you will stay there.</p>

Environmentally driven questions are also key to economic growth, so I want a message on this from you, Mr Blair.</p>

Now all of a sudden you say that the EU needs modernisation and yet not so long ago you told us that this was what the Constitution was for. Now you find the agriculture funding package that you signed up to not so long ago unacceptable. Now you cannot sign up to a budget compromise, because it is not the right deal for Britain. Yet your own government has repeatedly signed up to disastrous deals, particularly for Scotland, such as the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of disasters for Scotland, your own line on the EU budget limit would end structural funding in Scotland at a cost of a billion pounds. While it is true to say that the EU institutions need reform, it is also true that euroscepticism has grown in Scotland because you have continued the traditional UK Government practice of selling out Scotland's interests in cobbled together compromises. The best form of constitutional reform for Scotland would be to represent ourselves in the European Union as an independent Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important speech has been given by a politician who does not use the empty phrases, or Eurospeak, so beloved of Brussels bureaucrats. Whether one agrees with him or not, his speeches are worth hearing. Mr Blair, I remember well the speech you gave in Warsaw four years ago, at a meeting with the Prime Ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. In that speech, you rightly referred to the vision of a Europe of nations as opposed to that of a supranational Europe. The latter is an idea that only looks good on paper or in the minds of its creators. Today you treated this House with the utmost seriousness, by identifying those aspects of our present situation that are illusions, those that are challenges and those that are unquestionably propaganda.

We have to make Europeans more competitive, which involves setting limits and avoiding red tape and excessive regulation. I would also, however, like to say that this economic project is not at odds with a constitutional treaty; on the contrary, the latter creates the conditions without which the former cannot succeed, by creating better decision-making structures, greater transparency and more participation for the public. In particular – and this was something we saw yesterday at the Iraq conference – it also better enables Europe to play its part on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason, I think, why we have to make it clear that there is no contradiction between improving Europe’s economy and a political project, but rather that the former is dependent on the latter, is that the political project calls forth the solidarity that is needed if there is to be cooperation in economic matters. That is why we need both a political project and one market, rather than just a political project or just a free trade zone. The market demands modern conditions under which to operate, including social security and protection for the environment and the consumer. These strike me as important issues to which we want to respond in a positive way. We want a social market economy rather than Manchester liberalism, and we need to keep reminding ourselves of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Mr Blair, that if Europe is to be effective in this way, it has to set limits upon itself. Enlargement must be limited in the light of the present situation, in order that Europe may not become overstretched and hence less effective and less competitive. I therefore invite you to resolve this persistent contradiction. I welcome your statement that you want to advance the political project, and so I will take this opportunity, here in this Chamber, to invite you to become a full member of this Europe, for it is to the euro that the European Union owes much of its ability to compete, and I would be delighted if the United Kingdom were to sign up to the euro and to Schengen too, thereby taking full advantage of its membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Formulating new policies for Europe with fewer resources does not equate to a solution, and neither does suggesting reforms, including legitimate ones, which encroach upon other people’s privileges, without seriously questioning one’s own. The recent European Council adopted many foreign policy decisions to tackle external commitments that cannot be postponed. I hope that that is a sign of the will not to abandon an effective policy and the prospect of having a real European Foreign Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Iraq, holding the Brussels Conference was important; however, the situation on the ground remains serious and out of control. The United Kingdom supported military intervention, recommending it as a means of resolving the entire Middle East crisis. That gives you added responsibility during your presidency in terms of finding a definitive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Iraq affair further confirms that Europe’s international role is unthinkable outside of a multilateral context, and it was therefore a serious mistake, in the past, to split Europe, and today, for a number of Member States to abandon the objective of a European seat in the future United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">You stated that you were against having a free trade area; that is an important point. However, the risk of sliding towards that prospect is in the facts: if we put a stop to political integration, if we are not able to formulate new objectives and if we do not provide institutions capable of implementing them. That is even more necessary in the perspective, with which I believe you agree, Prime Minister, of a great Europe that is not closed off to the Balkans and to Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is deeply shocking on a moral level that the United Kingdom wants to shy away from the solidarity efforts to which all have consented in order to help the enlargement countries. It is economically dishonest to claim that farmers are sucking Europe dry when total agricultural expenditure is no more than 1.3% of the European Union’s total public expenditure. It is legally and politically abhorrent that you are arriving at a system in which you want to make the reform of a common policy dependent on the choice of a budgetary arbitration. It was at the request of the United Kingdom that the Court of Justice said that it was the legal basis that should determine expenditure, not the other way round. Finally, let me say, as a defeated Frenchman who is unhappy to have lost the referendum, that I do not think it is very magnanimous, or a very good example of fair play, to choose the moment when my country is on its knees to attack it.

Our citizens are not interested in dreams; they are interested in standards of living, and whether they will have jobs in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The real impact of the EU’s policies can be seen from the following figures, which relate to two current examples based on the past year. Firstly, there has been a 3.5% rise in workforce costs for entrepreneurs. Secondly, the cost to the public of electricity has risen by 5%. Neither of these figures gives any cause for celebration whatsoever. I believe that the British Presidency will make the leap from extremely cogent speeches to decisive measures, in so doing reversing the EU’s slide into stagnation, providing it with a new direction and enhancing its standing throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with one final comment. Much has been said in this House about the need to bring the EU closer to its citizens, and so I would propose that we start doing so here and now, in this very Chamber. We should reject the proposal for a common statute, as it would guarantee Members from all 25 Member States the same high salary and pension benefits, even though there is absolutely no justification for this. I believe that this makes a mockery of our voters, and that it corresponds in no way to their wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of us believe that we must not only begin a period of reflection in the European Union, but that we must begin what you have called a period of ‘renewal’ and what others of us may call a period of ‘rectification’, and we cannot leave the renewal or rectification in the hands of those who do not believe in the European Union. The difference is that the rectification must be profound and must be ordered, led by our conviction that the Union is needed and that we must not act hastily. Your problem is that you only have six months in the Presidency to carry out a profound and ordered rectification.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, when we act hastily, we always blame others for the Union’s problems, we blame the other Institutions, and that always leads us to confirm our own positions, and that is contrary to the European spirit. An ordered rectification is required. Each Institution must be able to diagnose what is keeping Europeans at a distance from the Union, and plan its work accordingly. The Council must do it, the Commission must do it and Parliament must do it. And each Institution must focus in particular on what is alienating Europeans today.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be the approach of one country that will lead the future recovery of confidence amongst Europeans; it will be a few European political projects, a few, but they will be important. The European Union cannot carry on talking about everything and saying nothing. We must be able to identify those political problems associated with Europeans’ real security, economic growth and cohesion problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that step-by-step progress was the key approach of those exemplary Europeans who established the Union; we must not take a step backwards today, we must raise our sights, we must go beyond the routine, which is the worst fault of the European Union’s bureaucracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 100 Years’ War has already been mentioned. You have even been told to do the Tour de France, even though it is an American who will win that. Myself, I say to you, ‘Turn your Presidency into Austerlitz, not Waterloo.’ When Europe experiences a crisis, it always talks about its values. The great crisis is war. The great value is forgiveness. It was forgiveness that made the treaties of the 1950s.</p>
<p class="contents">The other crisis, of the year 2000, was greater Europe. It was the aftermath of the Cold War. The great value was sharing. And if we want to talk to the people about the British rebate, about this cheque, fine. Let us talk about values first, and then define policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is right in the case of employment, particularly for those who have none, as long as we do not damage employment law. This sharing is true for those who have just joined the EU and those who are going to join. They need our support. It is true for the developing countries. Bravo on cancelling the debt of poor countries. It is true for the common agricultural policy, because, for my part, I am not very happy that about a quarter of French farmers are pocketing three-quarters of European money. If you can bring some order to all that, I take my hat off to you. There is not just the Duke of Bedford; we, too, have our little dukes, in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you will not be able to do all that with 1%; it is not enough. There is not enough in the bank account. I therefore suggest that you travel to Paris. Go to see Mr Chirac. Buy him dinner. You will see, you will be reconciled. Both of you, however, and four other partners, make more of an effort, otherwise you will find that it is the ‘every man for himself’ attitude that will regain strength.

It was a dream for 50 years. We are disillusioned by the present disputes. We in the Parliament have succeeded in coming up with a budget in which we have reconciled national sensitivities with the general European interest. Our budget may not be ideal but it is a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not linked specifically to any particular government – French, British or German or anybody else. It is linked to the wrong philosophy pursued in the budgetary negotiations by the one per cent club. It is simply impossible to have more Europe for less money. The Union should resist the temptation to make enlargement a scapegoat for or victim of all the problems facing the European Union, be it of constitutional or budgetary nature. It is the other way around: the new Member States provide dynamics and stimulus for reforms, which are indispensable anyhow. These countries are idealistic about Europe to the point of self-sacrifice. The Union needs more resources if we are to realise our ambitions. If we are to build a political and economic Union we have to move beyond the accountant-type approach, pared down to thinking in net contributor terms. We, the countries of central and eastern Europe, know very well what the price of our European dream was.</p>
<p class="contents">We lived through decades of hardship, violation of human rights, paying the prices of life, jail, gulag and deprivation. We are coming from the cold of Yalta, but the climate in Europe is becoming chilly and egoistic. How much is Europe worth? Are there two ways of fixing the price for Europe? On the one hand, is it one per cent of GNI, is it the rebate, or is it direct payments? Or on the other hand, is it not the price we paid, the price of commitment to European values and a community of destiny? But we place a higher value on Europe. Let us not put it at risk. The price we paid for it is not convertible into euro. One year after joining the EU, how do we explain to our citizens the gap between promise and performance? How do we put more soul into the European project? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the Constitution, I must point out that more than half of the European citizens and 60% of the euro zone have approved it and I cannot understand why the positive vote by 75% of Spanish citizens is worth less than the negative vote by 66% of the Dutch. That makes no sense mathematically.</p>
<p class="contents">You are a man of principles: you have approved a Bill of Rights in Great Britain and you have lifted the veto on the Social Charter. What are you going to do about the Constitution? Are you going to act or are you going to wait-and-see? This is a question I would like you to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the euro, you have had the grace not to speak about it. You will agree with me that, when we talk about the social model, we must also talk about the economic model. What are you going to do with regard to the euro?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financial perspectives, and since we are in a Parliament, I would like to inform you that the Constitution grants this Parliament the power of codecision over agricultural spending, a power that we do not have at the moment. Furthermore, if this is a Parliament that is to be respected, we must apply the ‘no taxation without representation’ principle and we must not go even further than Soviet planning; to produce financial perspectives for a period of seven years would go further than the Gosplan, and that is unsustainable. The President of the Commission is right when he says that we must opt for a transitional solution until 2009. Furthermore, we must stand for elections on the basis of a defence of our options.</p>

<p class="contents">That is the reason why the Europe of politics and values that you mentioned cannot put a stop to its progress, and cannot give up on developing its role as a major international player and as the representative of peace in the face of a number of setbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the objectives that we are working towards, a number of important changes are required, significant reforms designed to provide tangible answers to the people of Europe; in short, a Union is required that does not meddle with absolutely everything, issuing scores and scores of incomprehensible directives. On the contrary, what is needed is a Union that addresses the issues that, in the era of globalisation, cannot be resolved by nation states: from foreign policy to defence policy, from immigration crises to the fight against terrorism, to the trade challenges with China. Progress must also be made in the economic sector by means of the reforms leading on from the Lisbon process: the aim is to drastically reduce unemployment by means of support given to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with your analysis, we welcomed your intervention in support of Europe as a major player, able to keep abreast of the times and upholding the commitments it has made. We have one year in which to approve the budget; we can achieve the objective that we failed to meet last week and, at the same time, we must not abandon the commitments that we have made with the countries that are keeping a close eye on the Union. Bulgaria and Romania can enter our shared home in 2007 and negotiations can be started up with Turkey, in order to have a Union that looks to the East, but also to the South, to the South also in terms of Africa, a continent that harbours great hopes of receiving important answers from Europe: we cannot turn back.</p>

We absolutely must eradicate this scourge that is unworthy of our society, and this aspect must form an integral part of the fight against illegal immigration. The fight against organised crime and terrorism is also a priority.

I say that because a large proportion of the current debates concern the view of enlargement. I am among those who believe that enlargement to include the 10 new Member States has made Europe safer and more stable and has created better preconditions for peace and prosperity than ever before. For me, this is an argument for positively accepting continued enlargement and not an argument for trying now to close Europe’s borders. One of the most important tasks for the new leadership in Europe will be that of firmly establishing and developing the view of how Europe can bring about increased security and greater prosperity by embracing those countries for which enlargement is now in the offing.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Blair, I believe that the problems we now face in the EU have to do with the fact that Europe is better than ever. That also means that the European Union is a greater challenge than ever. It is not a question, as is sometimes said, of a conflict between the old and the new Europe or between a free-trade Europe and political union. The European Union is a political union and must fulfil its task on that basis. It is a question, instead, of moving on from the old European Union of 6, 9, 12 or 15 Members to today’s EU of 25 Member States. This requires respect for variation and diversity and also an ability to take advantage of the dynamism that exists throughout Europe. It requires openness towards the new Member States. It requires an ability to find the common denominators, to pin our hopes on the knowledge-based, instead of subsidy-based, society and to put our faith in the new enterprises instead of making agricultural aid an obstacle to the research and development we need. I hope, on behalf of the Swedish Moderates, that you will lay the basis for the new leadership needed by the new Europe and the new European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his view that the EU needs to be changed. I share his view that the EU needs to become more active in the world. I share his view that the EU is not only a free trade area but also a political union. I also share his views on the Budget. The British rebate is out of date, but so too is agricultural policy and those aspects of agricultural policy in which we currently put our faith. That too needs to be changed. We need to invest, for example, in research and development and in developing people’s skills. What we talk about during and after important meetings must be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share Prime Minister Blair’s view of the social Europe. It is true that he was involved in introducing the Social Chapter, as well as the employment strategy and the active labour market policy in EU cooperation. All that was good, but we must go further and find a balance. That is why we must obtain a draft Services Directive that balances the trade in services, for that is something we need. At the same time, we need sound conditions in the labour market, consumer rights and high environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a working time directive that takes account of precisely what you just said about being able to combine family life and working life so that the one party does not work him- or herself to death and so that we do not compete on the basis of long working hours. We need a recruitment directive, not in order to pull the rug out from under the recruitment companies but in order to create a framework. If you succeed in opening the door to trade and in opening up the borders and, at the same time, in developing the social Europe, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament shall support you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That amounts to a huge pledge of confidence in you on the part of this House, whose Members are the representatives of the citizens of this European Union – the true representatives, because they are the only ones to be directly elected. At a time when this European Union is going through an identity crisis – and you yourself, Mr Blair, spoke of a crisis of leadership – it is vital that we remember that this Europe of ours, having been in existence for 50 successful years, needs a ‘bottom-up’ rather than ‘top-down’ approach. What that means is that we have to carry the public with us rather than alienate them, and whose vocation is it to do that if not their directly elected representatives? This is not just about Europe’s need for better regulations; most of all, it needs fewer of them, and that I say not only to the Commission, but also to the Members on the left of the political spectrum here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects, Mr Blair, your speech was persuasive; you were particularly convincing when you spoke of the principle that some changes are necessary if what is good is to be retained. That principle is one that your future successor as President-in-Office of the Council, Austria’s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, has chosen as his watchword. I also welcome your desire to resolve the dispute about the European Union’s objectives that has ensued from the constitutional crisis. I have to say, though, that your presidency will be judged not only by what it intends to do but also, and especially, by what it actually does.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that you will not mind if I ask what practical steps you intend to take in order to get the Financial Perspective completed under your presidency; secondly, what you propose to do to keep the constitutional process alive; and, thirdly, what answers you would give to those members of the public who fear that the European Union is over-extending itself. Do you not think there is something paradoxical about mentioning Turkey and Croatia in the same breath? Many members of the public have misgivings about a large country like Turkey, but not about a small one like Croatia.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In terms of assessing his intentions in the field that concerns me as the Socialist Group’s spokesman for development and humanitarian action, I must comment on the approach announced by his government in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I will express my satisfaction at the fact that the British Presidency’s main priorities include increasing the European Union's action and resources in the field of solidarity with the developing world: achieving the Millennium Objectives — they will be classified as a priority goal — with eradicating poverty as the main concern and Africa as the main focus, because Africa is one of the main elements of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two further comments. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that the Luxembourg Presidency set very high standards with the decisions of the Development Council in May; let us hope that the British Presidency understands that these decisions provide a good launching pad for promoting its action over these six months.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like secondly to highlight and welcome the fact that the British Presidency’s priorities in the field that I have been referring to coincide with those of the Socialist Group. This is natural, not just because our values coincide, but because for months we have been cooperating intensely with our colleagues in the British Cabinet, Hillary Ben and Garret Thomas. Let us hope that the British Presidency intends to maintain a close relationship with this Parliament over these six months in this field; I am sure that, in that way, we will make more and better progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last weekend’s political sparring and lack of conclusion to the summit was not worthy either of you, Mr Blair, nor of Mr Chirac. Where was the Tony Blair of the Good Friday Agreement, a man of understanding and goodwill, who could bring both sides of an intractable conflict to the table; a man who showed singular courage on the Iraq question, regardless of our views of the right or wrong. It may well be good for you and for your image at home, Mr Blair, to stand up to the French and to play to the residual, historic emotion that finds resonance in British chemistry. But remember the 100 Years War in the Middle Ages: the British came out of it with much less than they went in. Fontainebleau was Margaret Thatcher’s Agincourt, when she walked away with the British rebate, and now, 20 years on, that rebate is worth a farthing in the pound of British GDP. Yet, Mr Blair, you are prepared to sacrifice Europe’s budget agreement and the European project to continue being the populist servant of Mr Murdoch and his newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">If Kohl or Mitterrand had been at the table last weekend, we would have had a conclusion. We are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair, you were right to say that we must modernise Europe’s social model on the basis of a strong economy and not at the expense of it. It is true that we urgently need to peel back regulation and that China is investing threefold in research and innovation. However, splitting hairs over decimal points on the budget last weekend has put Europe’s ambitious Seventh Framework Programme for doubling funding on research on ice. So much for the Lisbon mission.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the common agricultural policy, Mr Blair? What exactly is your intention in relation to that? Do you understand the income crisis that exists among the vast majority of our farmers across the Europe of 25? Have you forgotten the unanimous agreement on radical reform of the CAP that you personally endorsed and your government signed up to only 18 months ago? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The UK is right to question the entire EU budget architecture based on a distorted, wasteful common agricultural policy, which harms developing world farmers. Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed, with the funds freed up, used to address modern priorities like research and development, combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans, help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fledgling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq. This is happening at a time when the US is anxious to mend fences with the EU and needs our help.</p>
<p class="contents">As a priority, I hope that Britain will put the roadmap for Arab-Israeli peace back on the agenda and combat nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea. I support EU enlargement with a wider, looser flexible Europe. I welcome the proverbial Polish plumber and recognise that the new countries are driving the economic reformist agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria. As much as I support Ukraine’s EU aspirations, we have not carried Europe’s public with us on enlargement. I hope the UK will emphasise human rights violations in brutal regimes such as Burma and Zimbabwe. As a Commonwealth country, we have a very special influence on these countries in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit meeting with Russia, it will need reminding of its obligations in Chechnya and must be made to understand that it must respect the sovereignty of its former satellites such as Ukraine. In the case of Moldova and Georgia, it should be encouraged to withdraw its troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair, you might also might want to use some of your goodwill with Turkey to resolve the Armenia embargo and border issue. Lastly, we must maintain the arms embargo on China, with its lamentable human rights record and threats to Taiwan. Certainly, building a multi-polar world with China and the EU as a counterweight to the US should play no part in this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because I know from my own experience that the enlargement issue played a particular part in the debate around the referenda in France and the Netherlands that I believe that the present period of reflection must include consideration of it. What we have here is a new situation. After adopting the Treaty of Nice, we discovered that it would not function adequately if we had 25 or 28 Member States, and so we summoned a convention and compiled a draft Constitution, which you, Mr Blair, support. We know too, though, that there is no very great likelihood of this draft Constitution seeing the light of day in its present form. That is what makes this situation new. There is also a fourth criterion for accession, one that is of very considerable significance, and it is the one adopted in Copenhagen, which states that consideration must also be given to the Union’s own capacity to cope with further accessions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence not only of a constitution but also of any financial settlement, we have to ask ourselves the very serious question as to whether it really is well-advised to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 4 October. We have to ask ourselves – that is, the European Union itself – whether we really are in a fit state to handle another enlargement. Along with many of my friends, I take the view that this question has to be answered, and firmly, in the negative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must point out that the Union has entered a period of crisis, a credibility crisis, and I shall explain why:</p>
<p class="contents">- In March 2000, the European Council agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. During the review last March, it was decided to give greater emphasis to research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">- In Brussels in October 2002, the European Council agreed on the 2007-2013 financing framework for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">- In Athens in April 2003, all the Heads of State agreed to and endorsed enlargement. That brings us to today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy: the Council proposal for financing the strategy cancels it in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture: Prime Minister, you yourself have questioned the compromise on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement: you have welcomed the 10 new Member States, but with less money. By contrast, the European Parliament, in adopting the Böge report, has shown that it is consistent in what it professes.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, I share your views about the need for reforms which will make us more competitive on the international stage, but we need to combine the validity of this position with respect for what has been agreed. I ask you:</p>
<p class="contents">- Firstly, taking account of the fact that the compromise on agricultural spending was achieved after reciprocal and painful concessions, taking account of the fact that the basic principle of international law is the <span class="italic">'pacta sunt servanta</span>' principle and, finally, taking account of the fact that a new compromise will be impossible to achieve today with 25 Member States and the current institutional framework, do you consider it advisable that we exhaust this issue?</p>
<p class="contents">- Secondly, with what budget do you intend ...</p>

And, as well as this legitimate vision, there is another complementary vision of Europe (I would be grateful if Mr Blair could put on his headphones), there is another legitimate Europe which is complementary to the former, which is the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of hard cash, and the Europe of the net contribution and the net beneficiary, and the Europe of the British rebate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you believe that we in Europe no longer see ourselves simply as consumers in a big market, but as citizens of the Union. There is a qualitative social leap from the notion of a consumer to that of a citizen and from the notion of a common market to that of a project of political union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that leadership is needed in order to propel the project in the right direction, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, in order to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation and in order to give Europe a role on the international stage in accordance with its economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, Prime Minister, is not the problem, it is the solution. And we need more Europe rather than less Europe. And the important thing is to move on from words to actions. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is important to move on from words to actions and leave behind purely rhetorical statements, because you have signed a document reducing the European Union’s ambitions and budgetary resources. Or do you believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of doubling funds for Africa if we have less resources? Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of introducing the necessary economic reforms if we have less resources? Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the challenges facing the European Union with less resources?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wish the British Presidency the best of luck in its task of bringing together wills and creating consensus so that the European Union can move forward, but it will only be able to do so on the basis of two perspectives or two premises: firstly, by providing the money required to realise our ideals; and secondly, Mr President, by everybody seeking advantage on the basis of a common advantage.</p>

Following a Luxembourg Presidency led with honour by Mr Juncker, you are taking on the Presidency at a very delicate moment for Europe. At a time when the draft European Constitution, based on a careful rebalancing between politics and economics, appears to be stillborn, I hope, despite everything, that we will not bury its content too hastily.</p>
<p class="contents">The financing of the EU cannot be decided by a confrontation. Enlargement must be financed fairly and reasonably. Is it fair for the United Kingdom to be the only one of the 15 to have reduced its net financial contribution following enlargement, thus excusing itself from all efforts to reunify Europe? You have declared that the British rebate is not non-negotiable, and we take note of that. Do not forget, though, that the CAP has already been reformed three times. You will allow me to express my surprise at the UK’s reaction with regard to European farmers. The United Kingdom is well placed to know the extent to which European solidarity expressed itself during the two major health crises that we underwent with BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, and to evaluate the costs borne by the European Union to deal with those two disasters. The future of Europe depends on our ability to guarantee to 450 million Europeans that they will all be able to feed themselves at a reasonable price and completely safely. We will not forget that you have declared that you do not want to reduce the EU to a huge, dehumanised market. Your predecessor stated that he wanted an integrated, political Europe of solidarity. May the UK Presidency share the same vision of our common future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tony Blair,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I thank you for that excellent discipline you have imposed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would be interesting to see how you would get on in the British House of Commons at Question Time!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate. One thing, for sure, is that I have not been short of advice, for which I thank you. As you may know, some of our colleagues in the gallery today are from Kuwait, and have just passed a law, as was indicated earlier, giving women the vote for the first time. They are an excellent example of how progress and change can happen. It is good to see you here, Sir.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In addition, many speakers have asked me to try to achieve a consensus across Europe. It must be said, given the broad range of views, that is going to be quite some challenge. Perhaps the most interesting suggestion was that we made Welsh one of the official languages of the European Union. It could indeed be the way to achieve a consensus, but we shall see.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: our debate today has provoked enormous interest not just here in this Parliament but also outside.</p>
<p class="contents">I will try to respond to some of the specific comments made by the leaders and then make a short summary. In respect of President Barroso, I thank him very much for his kind words. I agree with the agenda he has set out. There is much in common we can work on. The only point I would make on the review clause in respect of the next financial perspective is that it has to be very clear, it must not be ambiguous. Let us work on that together.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of Mr Poettering, I thank him for his kind sentiments and we will do our very best to reach agreement on some of the difficult issues, in particular the financial perspective. He reminded me of John Major’s negotiations in 1992, so I was rather grateful for Mr Schulz reminding us that we defeated both him in the 1997 election and three subsequent leaders, but that is perhaps a point to make in a different forum.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the Constitution, I had not appreciated that you said this yourself, Mr President, but if you said, as was reported in the course of the debate, that it was not the text but the context, then I entirely agree with that. There will be a time when we have to return to the discussion of sensible rules to govern our working as a European Union of 25 – and even larger numbers in the future – rather than 15. The truth is that we need a new framework of rules for Europe and, therefore, the impulse that gave rise to the Constitution was entirely correct. It is, however, necessary to get the political direction firm in order to get the Constitution supported in the way that it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson challenged me over Council transparency and, certainly in relation to legislating, there is a strong case for that. Let us consider that under our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is good to see Mr Cohn-Bendit after all these years. A long time ago I used to listen to your speeches, and now you listen to mine.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Only history will tell whether this is progress or not!</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for not spending more of my speech on the issues of the environment and climate change. I hope that at the G8 summit we will have at least a chance for these issues to dominate the discussion. They will be a major aspect of our European Union presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of what Mr Mote said about the rebate, I repeat that we must look at all of this in the round. These issues all need to be resolved together. All I would point out is that without the rebate we would have been contributing about 15 times as much as other similar sized countries over the past 10 years, and even with it, we are contributing more. Without it in existence at all, over the next financial perspective we would be the largest net contributor. I understand your concerns and I repeat that Britain will pay its fair share of enlargement. We support enlargement and will contribute towards it. However, the issue has to be resolved in a way that is satisfactory for everybody and in the context, particularly, of the point about the review that we discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for not dealing with every single individual point. In some contributions there has been a sense that this is just a dispute between leaders based on personality or disagreements between countries. I want to make it clear that, in general terms, I think I have shown over the past eight years that I have always tried to reach consensus at a European level and it is important that we do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Obviously I have not reached consensus on that statement!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty we have at the moment which I just want to describe to you is: why is it that I feel so passionately about the reform agenda? It is because of a sense of urgency. We do not quite realise in Europe the competitive economic challenge we face today. It is serious and it is urgent!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is strange how things happen but just now everybody has mentioned China, India, etc. in their speeches. Now, however, people understand the seriousness of this situation. It is not simply China and India: take countries like Vietnam or Thailand today. The changes they are making in their economies are amazing and dramatic. The trouble is that in today’s world you have to adapt constantly to that process of change. My worry is that if we do not, two things will happen. First, the very social model and the idea of social solidarity that we, and I, believe in is put at risk. Second, if we cannot handle the challenge of change and if we are unable to adapt to do so, then as a result support comes about for the policies that Mr Farage outlined for the UK Independence Party. I have to tell him that I completely disagree with those policies. I do not want Britain to be in the position of leading a charge against the European Union. That is not my determination at all. The difference between you and me is very simple: you see the problems of the European Union as an opportunity to wreck the European Union, I see them as the necessity for reinvigorating the European Union. There is a big difference between the two.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware, as I have said in my own Parliament and country, this debate for change and reform cannot be led in any other way than from a pro-European perspective. That is something I understand. It is not enough for each person to simply claim Europe for themselves and to say that if you challenge what I am saying, it means somehow you are against Europe. The question, as was rightly put by several speakers in the debate, is not whether Europe should change or whether we believe in Europe, but how Europe should change and what type of Europe we believe in today. That is the issue for us and it is the issue we have to address with a genuine seriousness of purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one other final point. I have said why I support the Constitution. But I will be frank with you. The one thing that worried me during the course of all the debates about the Constitution was this: there is a tendency that I have noticed over my eight years as Prime Minister for Europe sometimes to go back over institutional questions when the questions are really about policy direction. We can debate some of these institutional questions for a very long time. Sometimes you also find it in leaders – and I do not absolve myself of responsibility on this – who, when there is a problem, want to blame a European institution rather than refashion a European policy. It is true that we all have a tendency to do that. My point is that when we decide the direction of Europe – and that is what the coming months have to be about; when we have the debate about how Europe copes with these great challenges, we should always keep our minds focused on the daily concerns of the people we represent. You are the directly elected part of the European institutions. You know how important it is when you go out into your communities to respond to what they talk about. They talk about jobs, security, crime and immigration. They worry about the change in their daily lives. We must have the clear, tough, proper policies to deal with these challenges. If we do, they will respond to us and tell us that they agree it is sensible to have a new European Constitution, because they will then understand the political context in which that constitutional debate is happening. This is a big moment of decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would only say that today’s debate in the European Parliament has been excellent. I am honoured to have sat through it, I know there have been many different views and some critical things have been said about me and my presidency. That is part of a healthy democratic debate. I would just suggest to you that if we could replicate this debate in our individual countries and go out and engage with our people and talk to them about what we believe in, why we think Europe is necessary for today’s world, why we want to make the changes necessary to bring it into line with people’s priorities, then in the very act of debate we will help Europe; in the very reaching out to people we will show our relevance; in the very satisfaction of being in a position to answer their concerns, we will reinvigorate the European project. I have found today’s debate immensely impressive. It has been a genuine privilege to sit through it, and I thank you for listening to me.</p>

We all understand that this situation is a very special one. It should not be seen as business as usual. I understand that there is a real appetite for a frank debate. There were, of course, different views, but this debate has shown that there is a will for the search for consensus. In that search for consensus, it is important to avoid simplifications: the idea to put those who are in favour of a free market against those who are for social commitment; the idea to put political integration against economic integration. The truth is that we need economic integration and political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a consensus, but not one that ignores the need for the hard choices that Europe must make. There is now a risk in Europe: the risk of populism. Sometimes populism on the left against globalisation and foreign competition; sometimes populism on the right, just against foreigners and against the very idea of Europe. That is why it is important that all those who have some responsibility in Europe – be it at national or European level – fight that populism and show, collectively, their commitment to the values that make Europe a great project.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that responsible politicians fight that populism and do not resort to tabloid politics. That is why it is important that we should not be blocked now by the institutional problems we have. We must go ahead with our programme. The European Union must avoid paralysis. That is why it is very urgent to have a solution for the financial perspectives. That is why we have to respond to the expectations, namely of the new Member States that are looking to us for solidarity. That was their expectation and we should be committed to meeting their expectations. That is why Europe needs ambition for reform and solidarity. The way forward for Europe is not to avoid the very idea of solidarity. Without solidarity and cohesion there is no such thing as a Union. A Union requires the mechanisms of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to working with you, Prime Minister Blair, in what I hope will be a successful presidency. You can count on us. We are going to our work every day. We have been doing everything to avoid the idea that Europe is paralysed. After that very difficult European Council, Prime Minister Juncker and I attended the successful summits in Canada and the United States. Yesterday we had a very successful conference here on Iraq. Yesterday the Commission took very important and courageous decisions: the Green Paper on energy efficiency; a new sugar market reform – which shows, by the way, that the common agricultural policy can also be reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening I leave for Africa because, like you, I attach great importance to the African agenda and our solidarity with that continent. I hope that I will also help your G8 presidency for the goals for Africa and our solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude and to summarise, we have to reform and change. However, when we speak about reform and change we are speaking about reforming our economy and making it more competitive. We are not speaking about changing or reforming the old values of the European Union or of Europe, the values that were those of our founding fathers for a European Union that believes in solidarity with ambition for all our citizens.</p>
