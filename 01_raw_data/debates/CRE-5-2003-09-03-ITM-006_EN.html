<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the lack of security and the serious attacks staining Iraq with blood are cause for very great concern. I regret to say that they detract attention not only from the reconstruction work in progress and the necessary measures for a speedy return to normality but also from the many indications of a genuine renewal: exchanges of opinions, freedom of religious practice, institutions representing an initial, albeit hesitant, stage of democracy, and the attempt to re-establish equal opportunities and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent tragic events confirm how the fight against terrorism and efforts to establish security and stability in Iraq must continue to be a priority for all countries and for the international community. Our enemies are those who are targeting the advocates of moderation and the decision to take up a new and difficult challenge; those who targeted Sérgio Vieira de Mello because he was doing good, because he was toiling with his forces to set the country back on its feet: those who targeted him are the enemies of us all, the enemies of the project to build a democratic Iraq. The task of rebuilding Iraq and restoring it to normality is therefore the concern of the international community; the European Union cannot and must not shirk its responsibilities. There must therefore be increasing support for this objective. The reestablishment of law and order is putting great pressure on the coalition forces, but this is the time when it is necessary to draw in the threads of solidarity so that an increasing number of countries can work together to re-establish security.</p>
<p class="contents">After the cowardly terrorist attack on the United Nations in Baghdad on 19 August that claimed innocent victims from among those who served the cause of peace, including Sérgio Vieira de Mello, whom I have just mentioned, and after the bloody attack in Najaf on 29 August, it is the duty of us all to further increase our efforts to bring about the political, civil, social and economic reconstruction of Iraq. In particular, we feel that the United Nations should play an increasingly central role, further consolidating its mandate in this difficult, post-combat phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency therefore hopes that, in the coming weeks, a broad majority in favour of a greater UN undertaking in Iraq will develop in the Security Council, and it is making every effort – I, personally, am making every effort – working closely with the principal players of the international community, to achieve this important goal. Attempts to divide the international community or to destroy its cohesion are bound to fail since it is in everyone's interest for the reconstruction of Iraq to succeed. We must promote the development of multilateralism, of a multilateral approach to crisis resolution which is effective, capable of generating solutions. The Presidency is making every endeavour to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcomed the Security Council's adoption of Resolution 1500 and consider it to be a particularly important step forward in that it acknowledges the key role of the Iraqi Governing Council in the formation of new institutions in Iraq. The Resolution gives the UN a specific mandate, entrusting it with the task of assisting reconstruction. We – and I, personally – have great faith in the role of the United Nations, and that has been confirmed by the experience demonstrated in recent weeks by the UN staff, who have acted with the highest professionalism and skill, and that skill can be increasingly deployed to manage the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is therefore convinced that, to achieve the objective of establishing a free, democratic Iraq, it is necessary for the entire international community to combine its efforts to give the Iraqi people a future of peace and hope. The Donors' Conference, scheduled for 24 October in Madrid, will be a good opportunity to consolidate this international cohesion, provided – and I appeal urgently to the countries taking part<span class="bold"> </span>– that as many countries as possible are generous and willing to help. Heaven help Iraq if the Donors’ Conference should be a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the international bodies are assured a clear role in the economic and social reconstruction of Iraq. Reconstruction should be carried out within a clear framework that establishes the forms of participation by the countries and international organisations, but it is equally desirable that, pending the emergence of the conditions for this shared framework, there should be no lack of contributions from a large number of countries willing to take part in the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must therefore endeavour to ensure that the Donors’ Conference will enable us to establish a general framework to do whatever is necessary to contribute to the reconstruction of the country; the Presidency considers that, for Europe, which has already clearly indicated its desire to take part in the reconstruction of Iraq, this is a valuable opportunity to make use of its resources and experience. Indeed, our commitment to the reconstruction of Iraq should not be limited to security but should extend to humanitarian aid, social services, all the Iraqi people’s needs and, last but not least, culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to rebuild the country's infrastructure and transport network, providing all the aid necessary but also – or rather, first and foremost – establishing the institutional framework for the future democratic Iraq, rebuilding the education and school systems and the academic world. Reconstruction cannot and must not simply involve technical engineering of the social order: reconstruction must be the driving force for peaceful coexistence, and we must therefore promote, alongside the restoration of order, the spread of a liberal culture. Once conditions of full security are re-established, it will be possible to start laying the foundations for a civil society based on freedom and mutual tolerance, with which Europe will be able to build relationships of cooperation and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the major unresolved questions on which Europe must show that it is capable of making a political contribution and taking practical steps as a single entity, capable of taking direct responsibility for achieving security, capable of placing the emphasis on a culture of increasingly widespread democracy and focusing on its relationship with issues of security. A culture of democracy capable of dialogue with the worlds and traditions of the various ethnic and religious groups. The reconstruction of Iraq can and must be achieved. It is an obligation which we must not fail to fulfil, not only in the name of the great European tradition of undertakings in the field of peace, solidarity and aid to peoples in need, but also – not least, I would add – because Europe can and must do its part, calling for a substantial mandate to be given to the United Nations and making every endeavour to this end, in order to restore stability to Iraq and hope to the Iraqi people.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to begin by following Mr Frattini's eloquent remarks in paying tribute to the bravery and dedication of Sergio Vieira de Mello and his staff. I am sure the whole of Parliament feels the same sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">As it happens, I knew Sergio well, first when I worked with him for five years when he was at the UNHCR, helping to deal with the problem of illegal Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kong. After that when he was Special Representative in Kosovo, and more recently during his extremely successful tenure as the UN Representative in East Timor. He was an outstanding international civil servant – a man of integrity, dedication and wisdom and he was a wonderful and gallant example of the fact that international bureaucrats do not have to be boring. There was a wonderful <span class="italic">élan</span> about him which made him an extremely attractive interlocutor or companion. So we pay tribute to him in the warmest terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Frattini said, the bombing on 19 August 2003 was, in a sense, an appalling attack on all of us who see international cooperation backed by the authority of the United Nations as the best way of resolving the most intractable of the world’s problems. Like the minister, I am pleased that the Security Council has now decided that attacks on the United Nations and on humanitarian organisations will be treated as war crimes. What has happened in Iraq further supports the powerful arguments for an International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I was looking forward to working with Sergio and his team in Iraq. It is fair to say that in just two months his impact on the transition process was clearly visible. A number of tributes were paid to him. The tribute paid to him by Richard Holbrooke, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations – and in particular Ambassador Holbrooke’s reminder of how valuable Mr Vieira de Mello’s work was to every country in the world, including the world’s only superpower – was wholly deserved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely the vital importance of the UN’s work that explains the purpose of those responsible for the appalling attack on its headquarters in Baghdad. The murderers want this transition and the building of Iraq’s democracy to fail through a strategy of creating chaos. Last Friday’s horrific bombing of the mosque in Najaf, using the same store of explosives and with equally tragic results, is further proof of the aims and methods of the men of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope that our debate can send them a clear message today. Whatever our past disagreements – and important as they were, there is limited point today in focusing on them – we all have a stake in the emergence of a prosperous, stable and democratic Iraq. We should all be committed to trying to make that happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no intention today of going back over old ground and old arguments, though I appreciate that some of those who raised doubts and criticisms in this Parliament and in the political institutions of the country I know best will not feel – to put it mildly – that events have proved them wrong. The question before us is not whether we should be involved in the reconstruction of Iraq, but how we should be involved and what is required for it to be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">It requires security, as we know from previous examples of nation-building. In passing, I would add that we have not come close to cracking the problem in Afghanistan, another country where regime change has proved rather more straightforward than building a pluralist nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Success also requires recognition that the non-military commitments to security and nation-building must be as great as or, in the long term, greater than the military ones. It requires a sustained political and financial commitment to cover the gap between rhetoric and reality. You cannot build a modern, democratic, open society on the cheap.</p>
<p class="contents">It requires international commitment through the United Nations and its associated bodies. If we want to see the maximum international involvement, then we have to take account of how most countries think that involvement can be most effectively legitimised and made to work. And it requires – as the International Crisis Group recently pointed out in a characteristically thoughtful and well informed analysis – early and substantial involvement by Iraqis themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So what has the Commission been doing to help this process? Our first priority was to provide humanitarian assistance. In this regard I would like to pay tribute to the work of ECHO, which has maintained its activities in Iraq before and during the entire crisis, undeterred by the military conflict and by recent attacks on humanitarian personnel. This Parliament should be proud of the work that ECHO does, both professionally and bravely.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this important contribution, the Commission has been preparing its proposals for a European approach to reconstruction in Iraq, as requested by the European Council in Thessaloniki. We are prepared to help, if and when security conditions allow, provided that there is an adequate multilateral umbrella for our contribution, one that is separate from, though coordinated with, the work of the Coalition Provisional Authority. This is a message which I have personally made clear in meetings over the summer with US Secretary of State Colin Powell and Under-Secretary Alan Larson.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been wholly consistent on this point, and I do not believe it has been either inappropriately controversial or unreasonable to be so. Let me give one example of political reality. I do not believe this Parliament would support any other approach. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe my political judgment is way off the mark. But I do not think that it would be.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the endorsement of my colleague!</p>
<p class="contents">Over the summer, Commission officials have been participating in the international needs assessment missions as part of World Bank and UN teams and I would like to publicly thank them here for their willingness to do this in difficult security conditions. Two of our staff missed being victims of the 19 August attack by a matter of minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this crucial needs assessment work, the Commission and presidency have been participating in weekly teleconferences of a core group, together with the United States, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the UNDP. There is a face-to-face meeting of this core group in Brussels today to prepare a Donors’ Conference for the period before the end of 2004. It will take place in Madrid on 23-24 October 2003, and Spain has joined the group as host. I very much welcome that, and have assured the Spanish Government that the Commission will do everything possible to make the conference a success.</p>
<p class="contents">All members of the core group have agreed that we must not allow our timetable to be delayed by violence on the ground. But I cannot pretend that attacks of the kind we are now seeing will not inevitably have some effect on international reconstruction efforts. In Madrid, we will be faced with discussions on what specific contributions we and others will make to the reconstruction of Iraq at a time of uncertainty about what can be implemented on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this perspective in mind that I have made some initial contacts with the Chairs of the relevant committees to look at the budgetary implications for 2003-2004, and I had a useful meeting yesterday with the budgetary rapporteurs of the relevant committees. I am sure that the House will recognise that in these difficult circumstances we have not yet begun discussing detailed figures but, whatever the final conclusion of the estimates, we know the needs are great.</p>
<p class="contents">As ever, we have to work within the existing financial framework. That is the iron law that I have had to learn, whatever my occasional political reservations. And we must still be in a position to respond to the hopes and needs of other parts of the world, for example Afghanistan and Palestine, where the needs do not get any less. When we make our proposal, you, as the budgetary authority, will have to decide whether we have the right balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that we have all learned lessons – if expensive and rather painful lessons – over Iraq. For Europe, I hope we can all now recognise that the European Union is incomparably more effective when we work together, especially on the biggest issues in contemporary politics. If we can do that now, in Baghdad and Basra and beyond, then perhaps we can help to ensure that the removal – and we are all agreed that this is at least a benign outcome – of a wicked dictator leads to a better life for the people of Iraq.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my agreement with the statements by Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, to the effect that we now need to make a joint effort to bring peace to Iraq and thereby stabilise the region as a whole. Not only many European governments, but also Members of this House, have had differences of opinion on the war in Iraq. The situation being what it is, these should now be set aside; we will make no progress by looking for culprits, and our concern must now rather be the development of a common strategy that will help us to resolve today’s problem in a sensible way.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also see that what the increasing number of terrorist acts in Iraq demonstrates is that the end of the war has brought Iraq no real peace, and that the establishment of a legitimate and acceptable government there is still a long way off. For a variety of reasons – about which there is discussion everywhere – the USA cannot achieve this objective using the means it has employed so far. I believe that President Bush is right to call for a UN resolution on this subject now.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I would like to introduce a figure into the proceedings. The USA reckons its monthly commitments in Iraq to be USD 4 billion, which amounts to almost USD 50 billion per annum, a fantastic sum when set against its budget deficit, which is in any case enormous. That alone can scarcely fail to make it clear the need for cooperation in this area. If Europeans can now speak with one voice, then the time is also ripe for us to sit down together and try to work out a new policy objective. This will make it possible to clarify where we go from here, to decide who does what in the civil, military and humanitarian spheres, and thus to divide up tasks in a sensible way. If Europe and the Americans can do this together on an equal footing and work together with the UN in doing so, then I am sure that Parliament would be prepared to accept the Commission’s budgetary proposals and forward them, together with its mandate, to the Donors’ Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of ECHO in Iraq for the fine work they have done, which, I believe, gives us a real opportunity to contribute to peace in the region. There is no doubt that this is in our own interests, as there will be disastrous consequences in store for us too, in both the medium and long term, if it proves impossible to pacify the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Considerations such as these should also, however, apply to Afghanistan, and I believe that we should therefore attempt, by means of a new Petersberg conference, to bring about a truly fair balance of power and the equitable distribution of aid, including to the Pathans, in order to establish peace there as well. I get the impression that in neither Iraq nor Afghanistan has such a strategy been in place before now. So now is the time for us to take a deep breath and make a new start together, doing our best in the region’s interests and in our own.</p>

<p class="contents">We are facing a situation in which the devastating fire which destroyed the UN headquarters in Baghdad and also the murder by means of car bombs of the Shi’ite religious leader, Mohamed Baquer al Hakim, are part of a terrorist fight, but also of something which could be compared to a resistance and, at a time when everything that happened before the war is being reconsidered, we must be aware that what is required in Iraq is not more besieged troops, but to seek a timetable for the country to be reconstructed, and reconstructed, furthermore, with the involvement of the Iraqis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we do not have to return to the past, but there are certain principles that we believe still to be valid, and the first is the defence of multilateralism above all else in today’s world, and also our commitment. In this regard, what is becoming increasingly clear is that the doctrine of pre-emptive attack is a doctrine which we questioned and which has been shown to be entirely useless in terms of resolving the problems of Saddam Hussein’s tyranny.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bush administration’s lack of preparation for dealing with the post-war situation is surprising. Where is Secretary of State Powell’s exit strategy? Our question in the European Union, and I say this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the eve of the informal meeting to be held next weekend, should be how we can act jointly as the European Union, not by means of generic appeals, but of commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an initial point which has been clear from the outset and which has yet to be fulfilled, and that is that the four European states on the Security Council must act jointly, and that must be achieved. Until that happens we will be divided and it is important that we take that step because, as well as our international commitments, we have much at stake in the resolution of this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the humanitarian efforts being made by ECHO. It is very important for the Iraqis and also to demonstrate our commitment, but, in any event, what is being considered – and what we Europeans must resolve – is the approach to the future. This problem of the so-called chain of command, particularly in a situation in which the Budget Office of the United States Congress says that they cannot run to the presence of troops beyond March 2004, and also at a time when the US administration is presenting a new resolution to the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is very clear: we cannot ask for supplementary efforts while maintaining the current situation of occupying forces with a chain of command essentially led by one country. If we believe in multilateralism, if we believe in a serious commitment on the part of the European Union to the United Nations and the international community, we must propose sharing responsibilities, replacing the occupation approach with one of returning sovereignty to the Iraqis. And this requires a very clear and precise timetable and also requires a joint effort involving us Europeans and, also in a very direct way, the Arab countries, in order to achieve something which erases the image of an unacceptable form of neocolonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr President, that it is positive that we are going to the conference of donors – we must change the current thinking according to which the booty is being distributed amongst the friends of the occupiers – and we must be able to respond as the European Union. I hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will prepare a recommendation which we can vote for unanimously, or at least by a majority, during the second September part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The unstable and violent situation in Iraq shows that while a coalition of the willing may be able to win a military conflict, winning the peace without the legitimacy of the United Nations is a much more difficult matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group, therefore, welcomes the tentative moves towards a UN resolution which would place the coalition forces in Iraq within a multilateral framework. Liberals have always favoured a multilateral resolution to the problems posed by Iraq, and if the coalition is belatedly coming round to that view, then it is better late than never.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called 'coalition of the willing' was a curiously outdated 19th century balance of power concept, which always carried with it the danger of leaving at least one nation feeling aggrieved. What we seek is a multilateral, rules-based framework for crisis management within which there is space for the hurts of nations to heal. There is no reason why the United States should not retain command of a multinational UN force in Iraq, but it must be based on a UN resolution and give the UN and contributing nations the central role in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure thus far to find weapons of mass destruction is leading to searching questions at hearings in London, Washington and Canberra and raising doubts about the legitimacy of the enterprise. The way to give the international presence in Iraq a sense of legitimacy and regain the trust of the Iraqi people is to mount a UN-backed drive to restore security, to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis and to move towards government by popular mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The swearing-in of Iraq's first post-Saddam cabinet today is a tremendous step forward in that respect. We hope that the timetable for elections by the end of next year can be maintained.</p>

Nor, in a way, do I myself think it is much fun looking back. We have here one of those situations in which it has to be said that, as time goes on, it becomes less and less pleasant to have been right. When representatives of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities visited Baghdad in February of this year, we talked with the weapons inspectors, and it was our extremely clear impression that the inspection was working and that, if no weapons of mass destruction had then been found, it was first and foremost because they probably did not exist. Six months on, it may also be seen that this view was probably correct and that the weapons inspection was, therefore, working as intended, with the UN on the right lines in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing we discussed at that time was how such an attack would be taken in Iraq. Would it be seen as a liberation or as an occupation? Our message was: probably as both. Naturally, there is a desire to be free from a despot and dictator like Saddam Hussein. Is there, however, a wish to see one’s country occupied by foreign troops in the process? I think it can probably now be stated that our fears at that time were justified and that the attacks that are now being made upon, for example, civilian targets, the UN building and the Iraqi police are a sign that the Iraqi people are experiencing the current situation as an occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing we wanted to be considered before an attack was made was the internal tensions that would be triggered in Iraq. Recently, we saw the killing of the Shia Muslim leader, Mohammed Baquer Hakim. Not that I think he was a hero. Far from it. This is, however, an example of how strong the tensions between the population groups in Iraq are, and it shows the enormity of the task involved in the headlong plunge into an attack on Iraq. The demonstrations at his funeral were a mixture of protests against both Saddam Hussein and George Bush, meaning that, even among people who must have felt they were perhaps free of a dictator, there were very strong reactions against the American occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing we feared was that, with this attack, the UN would be fundamentally weakened. That, it also has to be said, has unfortunately happened. With a weakened UN, it can also be seen how much we in actual fact need the UN. The United States must now recognise that even 180 000 soldiers are not enough to restore peace and order in Iraq. More is required. The UN must become involved. We therefore now see it as a very important task to rebuild and strengthen the UN. That is one of the reasons why my group proposes that we give this year’s Sakharov Prize to Hans Blix, Doctor El Baradei and Mr de Mello. The idea is for Parliament to send a signal that what we wish to strengthen is international law. We wish to strengthen the UN system, and we believe that this is the prerequisite for success in that rebuilding of Iraq that we all wish to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Kanaan had worked for the European Parliament as an assistant to Pierre Pradier, and for the Commission, particularly in Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to Iraq, where I believe there are great dangers. There are those who say that the United States should admit their mistakes. Where is that going to get us? Personally, I do not want to be in the right and tell the Americans that they were wrong, because there was, at the time, one question to which we had no answer, and it was this: ‘How do we rid ourselves of Saddam Hussein?’ We may have been right to oppose the war, but we did not come up with any alternative way of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. In this respect, then, Commissioner Patten is right: the Iraqi people have the right to live in peace without Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Saddam Hussein is no longer in power, but the Iraqi people are not yet living in peace. In such a situation, what matters is not whether or not we are satisfied with what the Americans are doing, but that we help them and the British to emerge from their isolation. Whether or not we were right beforehand, it is for us to take the most intelligent approach now. That, alas, is too expensive, which is why Great Britain is currently reviewing its position. This is the devil of a business, being more about money than about principles, but that is life.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the UN were to adopt a resolution tomorrow, and the United States were to hand over operational command to it, it would not find it a simple matter to pacify Iraq. The UN is not God, and nor, for that matter, is Europe. What do you do in a situation like that, when a society that once knew such power has now completely fallen to pieces? There are those who say we have no right to occupy a country. To them I would reply that the Allies had the right to occupy Germany. If the United Nations had decided that Iraq had to be occupied, that would have been legitimate. The problem is that the UN has come to no such decision. There are times, unfortunately, when you have to occupy a country if you want to overturn a dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would welcome it if, today, the European Union were to put forward proposals by, for example, organising a conference on stability and peace in the region, which would involve Iran and other nearby countries. This would allow the United States and Great Britain to slowly find their way back to the UN. By concentrating the debate on the rights and wrongs of a UN resolution, we are in fact in a deadlock, as neither side is at present able to overcome yesterday’s divisions. What this means is that we have to work towards a solution by taking a different route, that of a conference on stability and peace in the region, and then hand over to the UN, which will take charge of rebuilding democracy in Iraq. I do not, unfortunately, believe that next year’s elections will bring us any closer to solving the problem of how to stabilise that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The US forces in Iraq are simply not able to ensure the security of either Iraqis or foreign nationals. Sadly, not for the first time in history, a war has been won, but the peace lost. The forces based in Iraq are sadly contending with daily acts of sabotage and loss of life. Banditry is rife in Baghdad and on all major transport routes leading to the capital. The Governing Council does not appear to command the support of the Iraqi people. Most Iraqis do not see the Council as being responsible for the country's administration and continue to blame the coalition for the many hardships they endure. I strongly believe that the United Nations must be called upon to play the central role in the political, economic and military transition in Iraq. We must all seek to restore Iraq to the international community under an indigenous and representative government. But the bottom line is that the US and British forces are simply unable to cope with what is a rapidly deteriorating security situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the difficult political problems in Iraq can only be effectively addressed in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations. There is growing political support for this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Security issues are always best addressed collectively. The United Nations is the body that commands the support and goodwill of the broader international community. I do not believe that the troops in Iraq can oversee the peacekeeping efforts in that country. The forces there cannot responsibly administer day-to-day activities in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not seek to reopen the debate as to the merits or demerits of what happened in Iraq earlier this year. I do not believe that this would serve any constructive purpose. We need to come together to ensure that the citizens of Iraq are protected. The only way in which this can be achieved is if the United Nations is centrally involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Iraq is a dispiriting one, to say the least. But there is no way out of this impasse unless the United Nations takes the leading role across a range of political activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the basic situation which, I fear, despite the Convention which you all applauded this morning, will not, alas, change in the coming years: we Europeans have not established a policy, neither in the past nor, I regret to say, now.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the reconstruction effort and our financial generosity are more than appreciable, but that is not enough to constitute a policy. I cannot see what we are proposing other than recourse to the United Nations, but the United Nations is no greater than its component member states. For the moment, the Arab countries – many of which stand to benefit if things deteriorate for, indeed, it would mean going home for many of them if Iraq were to start functioning properly – are keeping a close eye on things and many countries of the European establishment are also standing by, maybe waiting for the Americans to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">It disturbs me when I hear terrorist attacks described as legitimate resistance. I am concerned by these ambiguities at which, quite frankly, I am amazed, to say the least, even just hearing the terms used. Tell the Iraqis who have died that this is legitimate resistance. It may well be that we too continue to be undecided, even at a time when success in Iraq is in everyone’s interests, first and foremost the interests of the Iraqi people, who have suffered 20 years of martyrdom at the hands of Saddam Hussein. They, like all of us, have the right to a different kind of life and a different kind of development. Our cowardly actions will not help them; our cowardly actions will certainly not take us even half a step forwards along the road to democracy.</p>

Following the attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad and the attack on the sacred Shiite sites in Najaf, the faint hopes of a lull that would make it possible to gradually legitimise the authorities established by the coalition are disappearing, and with them the prospect of a more or less short-term transfer of the coalition’s current responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that it is sufficient to catch Saddam Hussein, which needs to happen soon, in order to put an end to the chaos that the dictator on the run is so keen to maintain, but that many others with him and, if need be, after him have decided to magnify further. I am thinking, of course, of the religious extremists who are prepared to die in order to fight the United States under the banner of Al Qaeda and other fundamentalist organisations. I am also thinking of its large neighbour, Iran, which cannot remain unaffected by the situation in Iraq. I am thinking, above all, of the Iraqi people themselves who, rightly or wrongly – as many have said here – consider the occupation of their country to be unacceptable, regardless of the justification.</p>
<p class="contents">In this latter, mainly psychological field, in my view the international community, which quite rightly hopes to end this chaos as soon as possible, has no option but to legitimise its action by voting on a new Security Council resolution that entrusts the United Nations with the task of restoring order in the country and preparing the necessary transition to a legitimate Iraqi Government. This was your objective, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I welcome the fact that the latest known US proposals seem to be moving in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish I had been wrong in my predictions, and take no pleasure in having been proved right. This is not about establishing who was right, who was to blame, or anything else of the sort, but about finding a way to resolve this situation. Most of us, I believe, take the view that an international solution is the only way out, but that requires international legitimacy, and that must first be established. It is because of the absence of such legitimacy in the past that the UN and the occupying powers must determine who does what, when, and where, and must clearly mark out their areas of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqis themselves must be involved at the earliest possible stage if, instead of concentrating on security and waiting until it is established, we consider as a whole the reconstruction measures that will be necessary – by which I mean the process of democratisation, the re-establishment of government, the creation of order, and of course the safety of all the people in Iraq, along with the rebuilding of infrastructure such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as hospitals and schools.</p>
<p class="contents">The sooner the people of Iraq themselves take on responsibility for the rebuilding of their country – its political system and democracy, not forgetting of course the technological, social and cultural dimension – the sooner we can expect the situation to return to normal. If they are to do that, I believe, they will have to have a definite prospect of taking their destiny into their own hands in the very near future; that is why we have to set very tight deadlines in the expectation that a constituent assembly will be elected in Iraq, perhaps by the end of this year, giving the Iraqis a sense of working together with us on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if international legitimacy is established and the Iraqis are enabled to share responsibility for what happens to them, we in the European Union will be able, by means of common action, to make what is in fact an important contribution; today’s debate has shown that the great political and national differences of the past are no more, and that we all agree, in principle, on the same objective, that of seeing this country rebuilt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom from the yoke of a terrible tyranny has been achieved. 30 years of vicious oppression, marked only by a few bloodied milestones of failed invasions abroad and genocidal assaults at home lie in the past. Yet guilty men and women are still at large. Trials are essential, but Iraqi judges cannot carry the burden alone. Their vulnerability is too acute to act in isolation of an international judicial framework and a freer Iraq lies vulnerable to gangs of organised criminals as well as to terrorist incursions. Securing her borders as well as the provision of increased protection for the Iraqi people are both imperatives today.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely the time has come for Nato to join with the Coalition forces. These already number many nations, but lack the benefits of Nato's longstanding expertise and close coordination. The Nato umbrella could properly protect the UN's essential guiding hand in an advisory, humanitarian and developmental role. Without that protection the UN agencies simply cannot function.</p>
<p class="contents">The keynote themes of the late and much mourned Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim included the demand for the full establishment of the rule of law and of the entrenchment of human rights in a federal constitution. Inward investment, the development of civil society, small businesses and citizens’ rights and freedoms, are also part of the democratic process that is starting to come together.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have decades of confidence and experience in all these fields. Let us now take up the challenge and join, in every way we can, in the restoration of Iraq's rich culture and human diversity and her return into the family of nations, through the establishment of a free and democratic state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If anything, it is the responsibility of the United States of America to think about whether mistakes were made in this context. Unfortunately, what has happened is what we feared. The dictator Saddam Hussein has been ousted, but the country is not at peace, conditions are chaotic, and aggression on the ground is increasing, not only in Iraq. That is why it is important to play our part, together with the USA, in bringing peace, order and hope to the people of Iraq. As Europeans, with our experience, our culture of peace and our economic opportunities, we too are called upon to make our contribution towards a better future for Iraq. A retaliatory or ‘I told you so’ attitude is counterproductive now. I say this as someone who visited Iraq shortly before the war and warned about precisely the outcomes that we are witnessing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty, our responsibility now is to rebuild the country, and it is probable that we Europeans will be judged by whether we can now find a solution to the problems in Iraq, and that means policies.

In the case in point, it has scarcely need of time to judge the decision taken by President Bush and his henchman, the British Prime Minister, to destroy Iraq, for that was indeed the aim. In reality, history will recall that this sad affair is based on a double lie. I am not going to dwell on the first lie as it has been mentioned many times: it is the famous pretext that one has to destroy a country in order to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction. There were none, as we said, as the inspectors said, and that was confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, look closely at the second lie, which is just as, if not more, serious. Do President Bush and Tony Blair really want to eradicate Islamicism or, on the contrary, did they want to promote it and establish it in Iraq? As I have already said in this House, a year ago Iraq was the only Arab country that was totally free of any trace of Islamic fundamentalism. Today, it is very much in evidence and plays there as in a playground.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the empire continue for a long time to play with Islamic fundamentalism and will it continue to receive the backing of those who support it unconditionally?</p>
<p class="contents">This is an extremely sad situation. There are many Members who supported that policy in this Parliament. I regret this on behalf of Europe for in actual fact all they have done is encourage a sad, short-sighted policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They are talking about an Iraq where the automatic effects of the initial strategic error are all too evident. The continued military occupation is turning the country into a special theatre of operations for the terrorists, who are even forming another coalition, improbable though it may be, bringing together Islamists returned from exile, all kinds of Jihadists and survivors of the Ba'ath apparatus. You certainly do not need to be a geopolitical genius to see that as long as the foreign military occupation continues, there will be insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is thus not to seek a broader coalition or UN backing for the coalition. We know what that does. If we want to stop terrorism developing in Iraq, there is no option but to return sovereignty to the Iraqis.

Once the totalitarian regime that had suppressed them had been toppled, all internal forces were unleashed, sometimes violently. It is the same with Iraq. Under these circumstances, an ‘I told you so’ attitude or gloating is inappropriate and unwarranted; rather, the situation is something for us to be concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">A regime of criminals has been ousted and that is a good thing, and it was necessary, but we are certainly not on a direct road to peace, stability and the rule of law. That is why the Europeans need to play a part. In my view, it is not enough to point out to the Americans the obvious fact that they are incapable of restoring peace by military means alone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Europe’s hour has come. We must provide help. It is our responsibility, and it is also in our interests to do so. I therefore want to say this to Commissioner Patten: he can count on the support of the CDU/CSU delegation in this House, both for his commitment and for the fact that we must put our money where our mouths are – for it will cost money. We will have to justify why we are spending the money. So let me say again: it is in our interests to make an effective contribution, together with the United Nations and, of course, with the United States of America and Great Britain, to support the road towards peace, stability and the rule of law in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, it should be our primary objective now, as we enter the new century and the new millennium, to do all in our power to ensure that Iraq is the last war in the history of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to do that for the European Union should be as follows: instead of sending armies to areas of conflict, we should be sending the philosophy and principles of peace, plus a large team of officials to promote dialogue. I know what I am talking about in this regard. The European Union is in a very powerful position to do this. Look at the century we have just left. The first half was the worst in the history of the world: two world wars and 50 million human beings slaughtered. Who could have forecast that in the second half of that century all those countries would be together or that we would be all together as we are today? Therefore, we should study how that was done and how the philosophy behind it was sent to every area of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Principle number one of the European Union is respect for difference. What is all conflict about? Difference in religion, nationality and race. The answer to difference is to respect it. Principle number two is to have institutions to do that. Principle number three creates the circumstances in which they can then all work together in their common interests and break down the barriers of the past. Those are the three principles we have in our peace process in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and all the world's major countries should come together to create that kind of world and to take the necessary steps to prevent war. The European Union itself, as I have said before – given that it is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution – might begin by creating a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation, backed up by a department of peace and reconciliation, which could be sent to areas of conflict with the principles of conflict resolution that are the heart of the European Union. In doing that, let us build a world for the new century and the new millennium in which there will no longer be any war or any conflict but total respect for diversity. Because when you look at humanity no two human beings are the same. Difference is the essence of humanity, and it should therefore be totally respected and never fought over.</p>

Today, I want to pay tribute to one of my own constituents, Mr Dewi Pritchard, a man from Bridgend in South Wales, 35 years of age, the father of two children aged six and just 12 months. He was killed just a week ago, the first UK reservist to be killed in this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">His role, as a military policeman, was to play a part in the training of the 35 000 Iraqi police officers out of the ultimate target of 65 000. He had worked for nine years for the German-owned Bosch company in South Wales and yet when the call came in June in the post-conflict situation to play his part in reconstruction he willingly went to Iraq and paid for that with his life. His memory is one that we should treasure as well.</p>
<p class="contents">No one who has witnessed the deaths of coalition troops, the bombing of the UN headquarters building in Baghdad and last week's attack on the mosque in Najaf, could fail to agree that security and stability are now the paramount concerns in Iraq. The coalition forces and the Iraqi Governing Council must have our full support in putting in place the rebuilding of Iraq and the process of transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the United Nations has an important role to play in this process and it is endeavouring to do so. However, calls for the UN to take immediate control of the situation, or even Mr Souchet's suggestion of a withdrawal and leaving it to the Iraqis, only play into the hands of the remnants of the old regime and some other outside forces which are clearly engaged in a campaign of destabilisation. European and UN responsibility should be fully engaged in supporting the process of reconstruction which is currently being taken forward by the coalition forces in Iraq, and the courageous men and women who are taking it forward on our behalf. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have the choice of either indulging in sterile argument, accusing each other of being irresponsible – which reminds me of the old medieval arguments about how many angels fit on the point of a needle – or of the international community, in general, and the European Union, in particular, mobilising the best of its efforts in order to restore security, stability and democracy in Iraq. And let there be no mistake, the democratisation of Iraq is not the exclusive competence of the United States: it is a responsibility which falls to the international community and as such is a worldwide need.</p>

It is an act of terrorism pure and simple. Since when, Mr President, has radical Islamic terrorism required a pretext for committing its horrendous attacks?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Patten has made a statement loaded with pragmatism and good sense and I, if I had to consider any aspect as urgent – apart from security – would place the emphasis on infrastructures because, being an inert system, it makes accumulated backlogs irrecoverable. Water, electricity and telecommunications services and spare parts are a great challenge for the international community, and I am sure that what the European Union must do is demonstrate at the Madrid meeting the financial commitment which lives up to the ambitions, Mr President, which were expressed to us this morning in this House by Mr Giscard d'Estaing in a style befitting a world leader when he presented us with the draft European Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say, however, that the instability and the attacks on the US and UK forces are a problem for everyone – they have been right from the start, right from the first attack – and not just for the coalition forces. It needs to be made quite clear – I do not think anyone has any doubts on this matter – that terrorism is never justified, that retaliatory action carried out using bombs, using suicide bombers, is never legitimate: this is one of our fundamental principles. Clearly, however, in addition to tanks and weapons, now we have to take to Iraq a roadmap for democracy, a roadmap for political and institutional reconstruction and for a new Iraqi Government. That is why the Presidency has said and continues to say that we need a UN mandate; that is why, because Europe currently feels the need to reinvigorate UN action but, at the same time, wants the United Nations to be more effective, more capable of taking decisions and shouldering responsibilities than it was during the eventful weeks preceding military action.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must look to the future, to when Europe will be able, for instance – as someone has said – to express in the Security Council opinions which have been discussed beforehand and agreed upon by the 25 European countries. I feel this is a necessary experiment. We must make every effort to this end, so that we may come closer to realising the dream – for that is what it is – of having a European seat in the United Nations. That is why the Presidency will report, next Friday at the General Affairs Council, on the positions – which I hope will converge and coincide – of the UN, Russia and the United States on a new resolution, giving the UN a central role, and then attempt to set out alongside these evaluations and opinions the unified position of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, I believe, be an excellent, exemplary way of<span class="bold"> </span>boosting Euro-Atlantic cohesion, to which the Presidency is committed, doing so precisely on the matter of Iraq, an issue which has damaged the relationship between us Europeans and our US friends in recent months. The Presidency therefore confirms that it will make every endeavour to<span class="bold"> </span>this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, first of all in the presence of the Commissioner who is presently responsible for humanitarian assistance, and also in the presence of the Commissioner who was responsible for humanitarian assistance before that, I would like to say how pleased I was that so much support was declared in this debate for the work of ECHO in Iraq over the last few months and indeed years.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of very good and relevant speeches. We listened with interest to the contribution from the honourable Member Mr Hume, whose own personal record in the area of conflict prevention speaks volumes. He rightly pointed out that in modern warfare most of the victims are civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with much of what he said about conflict prevention, but perhaps I part company with him on one point. If one wants to see an international rule of law, one must, from time to time, accept that it needs the sanction of force if it is to be effective and if it is to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure the whole House has noted the tribute paid by my honourable friend Mr Evans to his constituent, and we all know the enormously important and difficult job undertaken, as part of nation-building, by those who seek to establish judicial authorities and policing authorities where there has previously been chaos. Building an Iraqi police service is going to take a great deal of professionalism and a great deal of the sort of bravery shown by the honourable Member's constituent. I join him in offering my condolences to his family and friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I agreed with much of what was said during this debate. I agreed with what the honourable Member Mr Cohn-Bendit said about the regional dimension of the problems in the Near East, the Middle East and Central Asia. I agreed with what the honourable Member Mr Collins said about the importance of the UN role. This is a point underlined by the International Crisis Group report, to which I referred earlier. I am only sorry that those two honourable Members are not able to be with us to hear me paying those glittering tributes to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much agreed with what the honourable Member Mr Sakellariou had to say about involving the people of Iraq as much as possible in shaping their own destiny.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to face the fact that you cannot drop a fully-fledged democratic system from the air into a country. You have to build democracy from the bottom up. You have to build democracy through local elections and regional elections, municipal elections, elections for professional bodies, trade union elections, elections in all those functional organisations. That is the way we will embed pluralism in due course in Iraq and, I hope, in other countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the honourable Member Mrs Bonino was entirely correct – she has a way of pointing out from time to time that the emperor is decidedly lacking in clothes. She was right to say that we need a policy framework for what we do. It is not simply going to be enough to sign cheques.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one other thing about the Madrid conference. We want to be clear about what we need to achieve at Madrid. I do not think the contents of the collection box is the principal issue. The principal issues are these: we have to have a proper assessment of the needs of Iraq over the next 14 or 15 months. We have to know what is going to be required.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to agree on the circumstances in which we can best and most effectively contribute to meeting those needs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things that I want to mention again. The first is that for the international community, it is imperative to have a multilateral umbrella for our contributions. It is imperative to have an international trust fund which operates transparently and separately from the Iraqi Development Fund and the Coalition, though properly co-ordinated with what they are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that unless I can give those guarantees to the budgetary authority it would be very difficult to persuade people to make the budgetary switches which will be required in order to achieve a reasonable level of generosity within the bounds laid down in the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need reasonable security in Iraq. It is not a very sophisticated point to make. It is impossible to develop a society if there are bombs going off. It is very difficult to reconstruct and to build democracy and pluralism if there is violence and instability. We need to ensure that the security situation improves. We must not be deterred from making commitments, but we must recognise that the amount of instability will affect the amount of progress in reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the sooner we can transfer real authority to Iraqis in government to manage their own affairs the better. I hope that is going to follow from the appointment of the Iraqi cabinet the other day: they need not only titles, but also bureaucracies that they can run, policies that they can frame and services that they can deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at the beginning of a long road. It is going to be a rocky road, but the sooner we get started the better for everyone.</p>

A great deal of responsibility and complicity also lies with the EU which, despite many proclamations by its members about respect for international law, has legalised the above crimes and is continuing, as today has made clear, to legalise the barbaric occupation of Iraq, hoping to secure a share of the spoils.</p>
<p class="contents">For the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, this unacceptable situation goes against the feelings of our peoples, as expressed – including in the European Union – in the past and present mass demonstrations. It will only change with the immediate withdrawal of the occupying armies, so that the Iraqi people can take their fate in their own hands, and on payment by the invaders of the compensation needed in order to reconstruct Iraq. This should have been the stand of the ΕU if it wanted to respect international law instead of helping to flout it. Everything else is a ‘pretext for evil’.</p>
<p class="contents">Any attempt to continue to use the UN to get the USA ‘out of a fix’ and to continue the occupation is bound to fail. It is certain that the resistance of the Iraqi people against the conquerors, under any guise, will continue with increasing international solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
