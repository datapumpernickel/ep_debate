<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Veyrac (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a commonplace to say that our heritage and its protection are crucial components of European identity, a commonplace but true, nonetheless. Our heritage is one of the most visible components, one of those closest to the culture of our fellow citizens. It forms part of their everyday environment and their own identity. It strengthens the sense of belonging to the European Union by identifying the roots we all share. Protection of heritage is therefore a vital necessity in view of the ravages it suffers over time, but also in view of the new forms of attack it is undergoing, such as atmospheric pollution, uncoordinated urbanisation, demographic pressure and, unfortunately, many others.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has approached this matter very seriously with, in particular, two resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1988, which provide a frame of reference for the action to be undertaken in this field. I now consider it necessary to assess the current situation on this issue, taking into account both the principle of subsidiarity and the development of the European Union due to the increased number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth recalling the objective of the UNESCO Convention, which is to protect heritage and not to enter it on a heritage list. Since the last time sites were selected in December 2000, 690 sites have been added to the World Heritage List, 208 of which are located within the European Union. Of these 208 sites, 192 are cultural properties, 11 are natural sites and 5 are properties of mixed type. The fact that the European Union is highly placed on this list, with almost a third of the sites, is easily explained in terms of Europe’s contribution to world civilisation. However, in order to obtain a better balance on the list between the various categories and also between States, UNESCO has drawn up a world strategy and an action plan for the implementation of that strategy. I think it appropriate that Parliament recommend that Member States that can pride themselves on a significant number of listed sites should restrict the number of sites they propose in future. I think it perfectly reasonable that they should make a contribution towards making the world list more representative and more balanced, both geographically and in terms of its content.</p>
<p class="contents">When this report was adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, the two provisions on self-imposed restriction were withdrawn by a very slim majority. I do however feel, ladies and gentlemen, that these provisions should be reincorporated, and I have therefore tabled two amendments to this effect on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. Another proposal was made in the report for a European list to be drawn up, for UNESCO sees heritage sites primarily from a geographical point of view, which restricts their concept of what a site is. A port may be classified, for example, without any regard for the boats. A steel plant may be classified without regard for the equipment. I feel that Europe, the European Union, on the other hand should look at things from a dynamic point of view. It could therefore take action on dynamic aspects of heritage and, from this point of view, a European list may represent real progress. It would make it possible to raise the profile of sites which are of more than purely national importance but which are not yet accorded world recognition. That would moreover help to bring Europe closer to the people, giving them an awareness of a shared cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">There is often need for heritage to be restored. The Commission should draw up a report on the position of restorers in Member States with a view to structuring the restoration sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work. High-quality restoration requires sufficient funding, and the need for economy should not override the need for quality work. Finally, I suggest that the European Commission should, in liaison with the Council of Europe and UNESCO, look into the viability of a legal and fiscal instrument in order to facilitate forms of patronage relating to the conservation of the cultural and natural heritage. This aspect might be included in the deliberations on the harmonisation of European tax systems. Protection of heritage is an area over which we must be continually vigilant. It is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future generations. The young people of Europe must be able to identify themselves in this in order to build their future and to be able to perceive their European identity more clearly. Surely the feeling of being European relates far more to cultural references than to economic and social data?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me repeat this expression which you will all recognise as emanating from one of the great founders of the European Union, "If I had to start again, I would start with culture." It is something which could have been said by Haydn composing in London, da Vinci painting in Amboise, or Byron dying in Missolonghi. It is the feeling, the pleasure we all experience when travelling through the European Union and marvelling at the treasures we find there and the pride we feel that, thanks to the existence of the European Union, we are in some small way owners, and also their custodians for all time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of it is here in Europe, which is something we can be very proud of, although it also shows that there are certain inequalities. Also, there are very few sites, i.e. places that have been deemed part of world cultural heritage, in comparison with the number found in the rest of the world, and it is a real drop in the ocean, because there are many more sites that would merit this kind of status and support.</p>
<p class="contents">This simplifies neither the decision-making process nor the selection procedures. More applications are rejected than are accepted, and I think there is a need to redefine the criteria. The diversity of cultural heritage underlines the identity of a country’s own regions, which is why responsibility must primarily be taken and asserted at regional level, whilst acknowledging that they must be afforded substantial support from outside, from the European Union and from all those who are jointly responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">These regional responsibilities include the preservation of homelands, customs and traditions, the development of a country’s own regions and so on and so forth. As I see it, these are criteria that can primarily only be managed at regional level. The importance of world cultural heritage sites transcends the scope of regional development. They are cultural treasures, and bear witness to epoch-making changes and unique occurrences in nature. They have outstanding universal value. Architectural cultural heritage, land developed and cultivated by man and urban cultural heritage belong together, but the picture is not complete unless it also includes monuments to contemporary history, from the world of work for example, such as developments in working life, the building of factories, machines and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">They trace the development of the working process of our document, and also elsewhere in the world. It is therefore just as important to tackle the plundering of architectural finds as it is to combat the thoughtless destruction of the remnants of social institutions. Rapid technological development and changes in our environment really bring home how important it is to spare a thought for our natural heritage and take responsibility, in other words development planning and changes of designated land usages must feature more prominently in our responsibility for the conservation of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, when selecting world cultural heritage sites, there must be more emphasis on striking a balance between historic sites, religious monuments, the various religions from prehistoric times, contemporary history and natural heritage, and the assessment criteria must be amended with this in mind. The conservation of our cultural heritage is associated not only with a high level of responsibility, but also with high levels of cost. We therefore need to find ways of alleviating the financing aspect, of considering the legal and fiscal instrument and providing sponsors with incentives to make us more conscious of this responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to protect cultural heritage, and the Union’s common cultural heritage is its diversity. It is a great and vital responsibility to safeguard this diversity in every single Member State. I therefore consider this report to be superfluous. On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is my view that protecting cultural heritage is a task for the Member States. Up until now, the Member States have helped implement the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage by tabling proposals – many of them – for inclusion on UNESCO’s list of values of specially universal significance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is probably a disproportionately high number of European topics on the list and, as the rapporteur remarks, a little more modesty might well be in order. I do not think it goes without saying that there should be a special list detailing European cultural heritage. Nor do I think it necessary for the Commission to take on the major task of coordinating the initiatives, as many have requested. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a series of amendments whereby Parliament is to call upon the Member States, and not the Commission, to implement the necessary cooperation in consultation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe. I have done this in order to honour the principle of subsidiarity and also with reference to Romano Prodi’s words here in Parliament last year when he said, “Let us remember how often we have been made into a laughing stock because we deal with things that are absolutely ridiculous, which defy common sense and conflict with the interests of our population”. I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union’s work on hold for a short while. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Naturally – to come back to what the previous speaker said – every Member State of the European Union has a policy on these issues. Obviously, we have no intention of superseding national policy. However, we really do need a more general perception and a policy at Union level. And the reason is clear: it is because all Union policies have a considerable impact on how we preserve and promote our cultural and natural heritage – mainly a negative impact.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Union frequently funds projects and interventions through the Structural Funds which destroy or seriously affect monuments, the landscape and other elements of our cultural and natural heritage. There are, unfortunately, numerous examples from Greece alone. We fought long and hard some time ago to stop the Egnatia motorway from being routed alongside the ancient Dodoni theatre, where it would have prevented the audience from hearing the performance. Because of pressure from numerous organisations, the question of electricity pylons on the Cyclades islands was taken to the Privy Council, the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece, which broke new ground in its judgment and recognised, yet again, the value of the beauty of the landscape on these islands. Today, the question is still in abeyance of the new Olympic facilities in Schinia in Marathon, an historic site <span class="italic">par excellence </span>for the whole of Europe as well as a particularly important wetland which was initially included in the ΝΑΤURA 2000 lists, Commissioner. We should like to save it, quite how I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction is also in abeyance of the new museum on the Acropolis, a stone's throw from the sacred rock and the Parthenon. It is to be located on top of older archaeological remains, thereby endangering both the remains in question and the aesthetics of the whole area and the vista leading up to the world-renowned sacred rock and the Parthenon.</p>
<p class="contents">This project and many others have one thing in common: they hope to receive, or they are already in receipt of, Community funding. It is therefore quite clear why I wholeheartedly support the particular points in the resolution which call on the Commission to examine projects from the point of view of their impact on cultural and natural heritage, their historical importance and their visual impact, all of which should be made into eligibility criteria, before any funding is approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UEN Group will vote in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can question the need to extend this concept to sites which are not just monuments, natural sites or moveable property. There is clearly a great deal of ethnographic data which can be collected and protected as world heritage. The importance of musical heritage or literature in the oral tradition may be emphasised, the task of collection, analysis and protection of which still remains to be carried out in a good many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This heritage, which goes beyond the traditional concept which often embraces only monuments or sites, is often a factor in the daily lives of the people living on this earth. It is this presence and permanence in culture and daily life which should define the very concept of heritage, as indeed Mrs Prets mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to emphasise, for example, particularly here in Strasbourg, the importance which our fellow citizens attach to their national currencies and their determination to consider it as a part of their heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The German magazine, <span class="italic">Focus-Money,</span> recently published a survey showing that 70% of Germans are committed to the Deutschmark and wish to retain it. This percentage is an average, because in eastern Germany the rate is as much as 80%.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Finance Minister, responsible for implementing the withdrawal of the franc, recently published on his website a very interesting survey on the French people’s commitment to their currency. This is, admittedly, a ‘reverse diagnosis’ because they were, of course, asked their opinion on the euro and not on the franc. Nonetheless, the response was overwhelming. Only 26% of the French have confidence in this artificial currency. I think it worth informing you of the real state of affairs, given that this is something that does not appear to have been taken into consideration or to have any influence over the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Great Britain, which has for the moment decided to protect its national heritage in the form of the pound sterling, only 14% of young people in the 18-24 age range wish to give up the pound. By this standard, the 45% of Danes who gave a yes answer would make the recent referendum in Denmark look like a vote in favour of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans are committed to their own currencies just as they are committed to their own values, their own nations, their own natural heritage sites, their own languages and their own cathedrals. This is how national currencies should be protected, as if they were part of world heritage. This is the thrust of the amendment I have tabled on behalf of my group and which I urge you to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although Nice did not take the crucial decision of exempting culture from the unanimity ruling, thereby enabling us to take a more decisive step towards convergence, what is important, as the report confirms, is that the European Union is working to develop a diverse cultural area. Equally important, in my view, is Europe's awareness, as the report states, that it is over-represented on the World Heritage list and that this over-representation applies both to historic towns and to religious buildings, as compared with other categories of countries, to Christianity in relation to other religions and beliefs and to ‘elitist’ as opposed to vernacular architecture. This awareness demonstrates that the concept of cultural diversity and respect for what is foreign is an accepted idea right at the nub of the problem and will help Europe play a fundamental role in relation to the rest of the world in the era of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposals are concerned, I think that the proposal to take the initiative on harmonisation at ministerial level is especially important, as is decisive action by the Member States to stop the plundering of and the illegal trade in archaeological finds within the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover – and here I agree with Mr Papayannakis – I think that cultural impact studies should be a compulsory criterion when deciding which projects to fund with European money, so that we avoid causing what is often incalculable damage. It is to be welcomed that the Culture 2000 programme has allocated one third of its budget to cultural, archaeological, underwater and architectural heritage and to museums, libraries and archives, thereby strengthening national action.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the report points out, attention must be paid to rural heritage, to ancient and Palaeolithic forests, to habitats and wetlands, in other words to what are considered more or less marginal issues. Education and training in all professions involved in protecting, preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage are also important, as are raising pupils' and young people's awareness and developing a movement of voluntary activities which can also make a decisive contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the amount of work she has put into it. It shows, at least, that the European Union and the Member States have done their homework, and have done it well. They have submitted many applications, so much so that this has led to an imbalance. In my opinion, this is due to the opinion that it is especially buildings that must be registered. There are, of course, also other aspects, and I believe we should encourage Member States to take measures so that we can redress the balance and be more selective.</p>
<p class="contents">My own group is debating whether or not the European Union has a task here. First of all, the preservation of our cultural heritage, also at European level, appeals to the citizen. Our historic monument days are always very well attended. Our cultural heritage is an excellent tool to make the European dimension visible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, European added value is evident in many areas, for example in cross-border projects in the Wadden Sea region and underwater archaeology. The European Union can encourage Member States to cooperate, and can offer support in all cultural areas, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point where the European Union can fulfil a typically European task is research and education. So is creating clarity as to which areas transcend national interests. Drafting inventories and lists is necessary at every administrative level, and it is important to weigh up all the pros and cons when taking environmental action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would mention the deployment of structural funds. Preserving cultural heritage is important for tourism. It brings cultural diversity into focus. It has a bearing on employment. The question of whether the European Union has a task is not a question to me. In this area, the European Union has a task to stimulate, support and make visible Europe’s common cultural heritage. Accordingly, I, along with others in my group, will give my unqualified support to the rapporteur’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a UNESCO meeting some years ago in Casablanca, the issue was raised of whether to make the entire Alpine Region a World Heritage Site. I confess to feeling somewhat perplexed at this point, for I found the idea of lumping the entire Alpine Region, which covers a whole range of different areas, together as one site rather odd. I was amazed by the frequent discrepancies between the sites selected – certainly not due to any fault of UNESCO's but because of the varying natures of the sites put forward by the States. I also noticed the conspicuous absence of some cultural, natural or mixed sites. In this regard, Mr Costa of our group, who is the mayor of Venice, reminded us ironically, a few days ago, that Venice has never been classified as a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, upon reading the Convention my suspicion was confirmed: the 30 year-old Convention is now prehistoric. In the meantime, we have become much more sensitive towards culture and the environment – consider the buzzword 'sustainable development'. This is why I am afraid that the report will prove to be full of inconsistencies: some issues need to be simplified because of the need for coordination between European countries rather than European interventions, which can be unnecessary and are sometimes used by the Member States as an excuse to avoid their responsibilities. Moreover, in certain cases, the structures already exist. I would point out – and this is a positive fact – that the text refers to regional minority languages, which are covered by a range of protective measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are some good points. I would point out that there must be a policy of active interventions inasmuch as the protection of sites works well if the interventions also include the commitment of financing; the sums referred to by the Convention, which are minimal, are certainly not sufficient for active interventions, especially in Third World countries. It would be a good idea for the Commission, sooner or later, to indicate the limit which State aid may exceed, as laid down in Article 87(3)(d). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to do with the fact that almost every second square metre of the European Union is cultivated, both the agricultural landscape and land given over to forestry. The whole of Europe’s current biological diversity is a result of nearly 10 000 years of struggle and hardship. It is the fruit of cooperation between nature, the climate, technology and the human being as cultivator. That is what has given us the incredibly diverse and many-sided Europe with which we are familiar. I naturally believe that cultural heritage is a responsibility for regions and nations and not, in the first place, for the European Union. There is, however, one area in which the Union has complete power over cultural heritage, namely agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If I were in a position to decide, I should exchange the EU’s current agricultural policy for a policy which favoured cultural heritage and biological diversity. I should like to use subsidies to preserve the cultivated terraces around the Mediterranean and to preserve the biologically rich and fantastically beautiful meadows in the mountain areas surrounding rivers and lakes in thickly wooded Scandinavia. In short, a good cultural policy for Europe would be a transformed, modern and relevant agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we have any wealth in Europe it is our wealth of cultural diversity, and that belongs to all of us. It does not belong to just a small part of Europe, even if it comes from that small part of Europe. That is why we are all responsible for protecting our heritage and protecting this diversity. If something is lost from Finland’s heritage, then it is also lost to Greece, and if something is lost in Greece, then it is also lost to Denmark. Responsibility lies with all the citizens of Europe wherever they are and whatever the role they have to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, obviously the Commission welcomes the work carried out by Parliament, especially the rapporteur, Mrs De Veyrac, and it shares the concerns and the interests highlighted by this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally speaking, as you are well aware, the Treaty does not provide any legal basis for Community action in the field of culture and rules out the possibility of harmonisation in this field. Not only is the Commission not in a position to draw up its own list of cultural and natural heritage properties and sites, but it is rather reluctant to consider adding to the number of existing lists.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to my opening remarks, this does not limit our responsibility in the area of heritage conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, indeed, always cooperated with the international bodies, private associations, individuals, states, regions and villages that have worked so hard to safeguard their heritage and our heritage. In particular, we can highlight the joint action undertaken with the Council of Europe and with UNESCO, such as, for instance, the “Europe, a common heritage” campaign, or the study undertaken to support Kosovo’s heritage. This cooperation must continue, not just in order to avoid the uncoordinated duplication of effort in similar areas, but also to improve the effectiveness of the international legal and fiscal framework which some speakers have mentioned. I should, moreover, like to point out that under the Raphael and Culture 2000 programmes, we are most committed in our undertakings to assist the public, regions, states and associations alike, in order to support all those working at grass-roots level to conserve the heritage shared by all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The types of project that have been promoted continually include raising the awareness of and promoting the involvement of the public, especially young people, because, as you rightly state, respecting our heritage and nature is a matter of education. Schemes have also included the improvement of the methods and tools used by heritage workers in Europe, especially those developed by the International Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage in Rome, and the further training of workers and specialist craftspeople in the area of restoration, an area we have tried to develop through our education programmes, precisely in order to establish a supply of specialists capable of assisting with various ongoing restoration projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that we intend to continue on these lines, within the scope of our jurisdiction and our, as you know, very limited resources, of course, but we do intend to provide appropriate constructive responses. That is why I must thank the European Parliament for its initiative, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the Commission, because we should like to see more initiatives, private or public, being taken in Europe at every level, on condition that they go towards the objective of conserving European heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, this is why I am wholeheartedly in favour of the publicity we can give heritage aid by establishing prizes such as the prize for restoration created by <span class="italic">Europa Nostra</span>, or the European Heritage Day prize. What is the value of these prizes? Well, they provide role models showing all the citizens of Europe what it is possible to achieve, sometimes with minimum resources, in terms of preserving this heritage we share for future generations, a heritage which belongs to us directly but also indirectly, that is, the heritage of all Europeans, while respecting cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
