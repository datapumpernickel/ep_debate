<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van den Burg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, let me first start with a word of welcome, also to Mr Maystadt. I should also like to thank the EIB for the fruitful cooperation which, in the tradition of the past three years, has developed as we have commented on your annual reports. I think that Parliament can be pleased with the way in which you have taken on board the suggestions from those previous reports, and I hope that this will also be the case with my report.</p>
<p class="contents">In your introduction to your 2001 annual report, you described the EIB as a policy-driven public bank whose mission is to help achieve economic, social and, ultimately, political goals. I could not agree with you more. The EIB can play an important macro-economic role and underpin EU policy in key areas. The EIB is a public bank, accountable to the public for the policy it pursues. It is with these considerations in mind that I have written my report and I have emphasised a number of aspects in this respect. Today, I should like to single out five elements from my report.</p>
<p class="contents">They are: capital increase, pension funds, labour market policy and employment policy, EU enlargement and adequate supervision of EIB policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, capital increase. In its annual meeting of 4 June, the Board of Governors decided to increase the capital by EUR 50 billion. Parliament welcomes this decision and believes that funding this capital increase from the bank itself is a wise decision. We condemn, however, the Board’s refusal to agree at this stage to a further increase in the next five years. Parliament also applauds the decision to increase the funding of some projects in the sectors hardest hit by the economic slow-down from 50% to 70% of the total project budget. I should also like to draw your attention to the facility which the EIB offered during the autumn floods in Central and Eastern Europe to bolster emergency programmes to as much as 100%. I think that this fits in well with the image of an active bank which supports the EU's goals. In that way, the EIB also becomes visible to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I should next like to turn to the subject of pension funds. In my report, I enlarged upon the role of the bank as borrower on the capital markets. The EIB plays a major role in this area too, particularly on relatively new markets, such as in some accession countries. With its triple-A rating and long-term bonds in different currencies, the bank is a major protagonist and a very safe investment for pension funds, for example. A drawback is that EIB bonds are not always freely accessible. Government restrictions often apply precisely to investments made by pension funds and insurance companies. The EIB can play the role of icebreaker in order to promote long-term investments and, as a result, give investors more scope for riskier investments in their new economies. For example, the EIB could be an interesting partner for pension funds. This is why I tabled one more amendment before the plenary’s debate on my report, and I should like to invite the bank to play an active part. I should also like to hear Mr Maystadt's opinion on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns labour market policy. The Amsterdam action programme has been more effective in drawing attention to projects in the social sectors. Since time immemorial, the majority of investments have been in the area of hard infrastructure. It is, however, also important to invest in social infrastructure. I would apply the two-pronged Lisbon objective, both economically and socially, to EIB policy. Like last year, Parliament calls on the EIB to assess the impact on employment of the projects and activities implemented and supported by the EIB and to enhance the internal and external expertise in this field within all the bank's different activities and directorates. I am interested what Mr Maystadt's intentions are in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, we discussed the first round of the EU's enlargement in Parliament on Tuesday. The EIB can also do its bit by giving a high priority to activities in the accession countries and by allowing those countries to take part as fully-fledged participants. I have a feeling that the new Member States take too little advantage of investment opportunities. It seems as if they are imposing restrictions on themselves because they do not want to run up excessive debts. A creditable ambition which can bring them closer to monetary union, but something against which I would put question marks at this stage. Parliament has advised the EIB at any rate not to overlook the social dimension and to set up a special programme for the candidate countries and other partner countries, which should address the objectives of social cohesion. Mr Maystadt may be able to enlarge on this point too in his response.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Parliament urges an intensified co-operation of the EIB and the EBRD on the basis of a well-considered and efficient division of tasks. In fact, this will be discussed in a separate report by Mr Markov in our committee and in this House in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns monitoring. The importance of transparency and of the adequate supervision of the EIB group is something that has always enjoyed Parliament's undivided attention. As a public investment bank, the need for adequate monitoring is obvious, but there is still room for improvement in this respect. This is largely due to the EIB's dual position as, on the one hand, originally a tax-funded public institution and on the other hand, a normal bank which, in the case of the EIF, which also forms part of the group, is also a venture capital fund. As financial institutions, they are not subject to the normal prudential supervision that is set up for other institutions at national level. This monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which I supported here yesterday. I think that this can also play a part in the case of the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point concerns the recommendations tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control and I shall leave Mr Sjöstedt to put the case for these. I have given almost all of them comprehensive coverage in my report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, President Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having once again taken the initiative of organising a debate on the work of the EIB. I would congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, on her extremely interesting and comprehensive report which emphasises the EIB’s role as the Community’s primary long-term financing institution for key sectors of the European Union, the candidate countries and other partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would briefly like to consider the following four points: collaboration between the EIB and the Commission, the EIB’s work in the partner countries, the EIB’s work in the candidate countries, and the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point: the EIB is a policy driven public bank. Its task, as President Maystadt himself pointed out, is to contribute to the achievement of the political goals of the European Union in cooperation with the Commission. In this respect, the Commission warmly welcomes the growing cooperation with the Bank in various priority sectors such as regional development and the environment, and also areas addressed by the ‘Innovation 2000 initiative’ such as research and development, the audiovisual sector and information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the EIB Group’s consolidation of its activities concerning SMEs. It agrees with the European Parliament’s point of view whereby the Bank should adopt the Commission’s definition of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges Parliament’s wish to evaluate the impact on SMEs of the ‘Multiannual Programme 2001 – 2005 on small and medium-sized enterprises’, known as the MAP. In this respect, the Commission intends to draw up an interim progress report on the MAP in 2003, including its impact on SMEs, as required by the Council decision on the MAP. Furthermore, again as required by the same decision, the Commission will submit an external assessment report to the Council and Parliament by the end of December 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point: the EIB has increased its financing activities in partner countries, working in close cooperation with the Commission. In this context, the Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Facility, launched in Barcelona last October, will constitute an important initiative to boost economic development in bordering countries in the south. The Commission has given substantial backing to this initiative, pledging EUR 255 million of the Community budget over the next four years. Moreover, the EIB, again in conjunction with the Commission, is preparing to implement the new investment fund for ACP countries laid down by the Cotonou Agreement. As regards the Balkans, the Commission and the Bank are currently looking into the possibility of granting the Bank a mandate to operate in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point: with regard to the EIB’s work in the candidate countries, the Commission endorses Parliament’s view that absolute priority must be given to the Bank’s activities in these countries. We believe that the funding requirements are considerable and that the EIB and the EBRD must work closely together in order to contribute to the growth of the new Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the integration of the candidate countries into the EIB structure, the Commission is pleased to note that the Member States have, at last, reached an agreement on amendments to the Treaty with regard to the governance of the EIB and on its subscribed capital following accession. Once the agreement of the candidate countries has been obtained, this will enable the new Member States to be integrated into the EIB structure immediately after accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the fourth and final point: a very brief comment on the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission. The Commission feels that the basic principles of the Tripartite Agreement reflect a fair balance between the rights of the Court of Auditors and those of the EIB, and that these principles must not be altered. As for the Community budget, in accordance with the Tripartite Agreement, the Court has access to a wide range of information about the Bank’s operations under mandate and is entitled to additional information whenever it so desires. The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament’s initiative calling on the interested parties to review the agreement, an initiative which will doubtless constitute an opportunity to update a number of technical and administrative aspects in the light of changes which have taken place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My committee and I are grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee responsible have chosen to take on board so many of the views we have presented. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank has for many years been one of the EU’s more anonymous powers that be. At the same time, the EIB has very great influence by virtue of the extensive loans both to the Member States and to the candidate countries. It would be sensible to have a more comprehensive political debate on the bank’s approach and also more comprehensive scrutiny of the bank’s activities on the part of the other EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the European Investment Bank’s having been a fairly anonymous wielder of power in the EU is no doubt the special status of this body. It is a bank which, moreover, is basically owned by the Member States, at the same time as being a part of the European Union. We suggest, partly by means of the following proposals, that it be scrutinised more carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to increase the Court of Auditors’ access to information from the European Investment Bank. In the long run, this access to information should be similar to the access that exists to information from the European Central Bank. This is something that can be brought about through the tripartite agreement, which is subject to future review.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to see increased cooperation between our committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Investment Bank. It should, for example, be possible to welcome the chairman of the bank to our meetings. We should also like to acquaint ourselves with more documents concerning the European Investment Bank’s internal audit.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to see the environmental dimension strengthened through the EIB’s incorporating the Århus Convention and the obligations under it into its policy. We are concerned here with public access to environmental information. In a year or so, we should also like to see a progress report made on the task taken on in Gothenburg concerning impact on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to add that there is a need to evaluate the system of global loans which is at present a little too vaguely defined. A thorough evaluation needs to be made of the actual impact of the loans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Mr Maystadt, this is the third time that Parliament has been able to give its opinion on the EIB's annual report. The report by Mrs van de Burg is balanced and consistent, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore adopted it unanimously. I would nevertheless like to make some observations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to comment on the role of the Bank. The role of the EIB is important. The Bank is a major investor on the European market and outside, with considerable macro-economic clout. This macro-economic clout does not require the EIB to have its own macro-economic policy. The agreement is that the Bank serves the EU's goals. The Bank deploys its investment funds in order to strengthen the EU's macro-economic policy. In other words, the Bank's mission does not require it to adopt a pro-active role. The EIB is to promote economic and social cohesion within the EU by financially supporting the goals which the European Union has in mind. As a result, the EIB naturally has macro-economic influence, and, indeed a great deal of it, but this influence is not a goal in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the plan by the Group of the Party of European Socialists to include in the structure of the EIB a body to define the scope for employment and the effects on employment of EIB projects. Creating employment is not one of the Bank's tasks as such, but it is sometimes, of course, a side-effect. The Bank's task to modernise means the effect could also be the complete opposite, intensifying the eternal dilemma between productivity increase through high-grade investments and employment. Given this dilemma, there is no point in setting up an extensive employment barometer. In my view, employment is not a goal in itself as far as the Bank is concerned. In order to avoid unnecessary administrative costs, we have agreed to the simple registration of employment effects – or employment impact assessment, to use a fine phrase – but without any snags. In other words, employment impact assessment should not take on the scale of the Bank's environmental section. Sustainable environmental policy is one of the Bank's explicit tasks. We are thus opposed to a comparison of the employment barometer with the environmental section. We will try to prevent the comparison between the two, suggested by the word 'similar' in the amendment, by a split vote. We believe that the EIB funds should be used for investments and not for the system itself if this can at all be helped.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of monitoring. At present, the Bank's outgoings are covered by the EU Member States. It also generates money itself by issuing bonds. In our view, the issuing of bonds to pension institutions, as proposed by the rapporteur, is unwise for the time being because there is as yet insufficient transparency within the Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the amendments we have tabled will prevent the link being made to pensions in the final report. We expect of the Commission that, after three years of debating the issue of monitoring, it will finally produce proposals on how better monitoring can be arranged and what the Court of Auditors' exact role might be. I believe in the Dutch saying: ‘vertrouwen is goed, maar controle is beter’ – trust is good, but control is better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also, however, highlights the decisive role that this bank plays in the economies of the candidate countries for which it proposes, as a matter of fact, to create a special social policy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the increase in social capital recently decided on can be considered to be in line and consistent with these structural objectives, which are so important to achieving a global European economy that is prosperous and fully sustainable. The European Investment Bank is already responsible for more than 5% of all investments made in the Union, which has enabled more than 400 000 jobs to be created, specifically through the support that the bank gives to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that the European Union has recently taken on increased responsibility for the funding of venture capital, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the EIB. Unfortunately, as the rapporteur also points out, the work of the European Investment Bank is sometimes limited by the orthodox and rigid rules for the consolidation of public finances, which must be complied with under the growth and stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that a large part of the EIB’s remit is geared towards investments of a structural nature, such as infrastructures or venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that the success of these investments is often dependent on the possibility of mobilisation in partnership with public spending. The understanding that has just been reached, therefore, is not indifferent, in the framework of the current budgetary rules, to the flexibility that is crucial to the correct implementation of the growth and stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is increasingly clear that Europe has an aim which is also an undeniable need: that of becoming a highly competitive area and therefore, of creating wealth and of harmonising its distribution. This aim can only be achieved, however, through support for structural investments and is, consequently, unfettered by restrictions that could endanger these investments. The quality of expenditure, whether public or private, must be the guiding framework for investment policy and the European Investment Bank has an irreplaceable role in this framework. I congratulate the rapporteur on the content of her report and on having been able to interpret these aspirations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is also cause, I think, for sincerely commending the EIB and Mr Maystadt for the way in which the dialogue between the European Parliament and the EIB has developed in recent years. From having been, as Mr Sjöstedt pointed out, a fairly closed institution, the bank has since opened itself up to dialogue and the exchange of opinions. My first coming into contact with the EIB a number of years ago was due to the fact that independent organisations complained about the EIB’s lack of transparency and its failure to appreciate the need to contribute significantly to the EU’s efforts to devise a policy in favour of a sustainable environment. Crucial progress has been made within both these important areas. As we all know, nothing is so good, however, that it cannot be improved, and that applies too to access to information in several languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the rapporteur’s ambition has been further to emphasise the EIB’s overarching role in macro-economic and financial terms and in terms of political strategy. I share that approach in principle, but I would at the same time warn against we in Parliament’s expressing too many wishes, legitimate enough in themselves but meaning that we cease to focus upon the EIB’s main tasks, namely those of promoting regional development, supporting forward-looking technology, taking account of the environment and concentrating on the candidate countries and what are termed the partner countries. As you can hear, the EIB now already has more than enough on its plate. I would emphasise, however, that the EIB’s efforts in the Balkan countries, which are part of its remit, deserve increased attention. Where supervision of the EIB is concerned, we would repeat our proposal that the issues be addressed at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask Mr Maystadt how he views our desire for a panel of experts to be set up, of the type to be found within the World Bank. I know that there is a certain scepticism within the EIB where the view is that the EIB cannot be compared with the World Bank and that, moreover, the EU has the institution of the Ombudsman. What does the EIB intend to do to disseminate further knowledge concerning the global loans, that is to say the loans to small enterprises? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have, it is true, been astonished at the levels of bureaucracy that exist between the Bank, the Commission and the Council, evident from the financing of environmental protection investment in Russia’s Baltic basin. What happened showed that the Bank is not just a financial institution but also a political playing field. The environment suffered as a result of the political games played by representatives of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union guarantees a large portion of what the EIB lends and its loans in this respect do not carry any risk. A 3A credit rating keeps the cost of borrowing low in other forms of fund-raising on the part of the Bank. As the EIB has a good credit rating and the bad debt risk is low, it should adhere to stringent social and environmental criteria when granting loans. We have to promote aims that work for the common good. With that purpose in mind, the Bank must listen very attentively to the totally justified opinions of the NGO, Bankwatch Network.</p>

My group has submitted a small number of amendments which aim to highlight the importance of greater transparency and environmental commitment in the work of the EIB and also, in particular, to ensure that the EIB applies the highest ethical standards possible in project financing, including withdrawal from any project carried out in breach of national legislation or where corrupt enterprises are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with that last point, I am sure Mr Maystadt is aware of the ongoing court case in Lesotho, where European companies are on trial for allegedly paying bribes to win contracts in the Lesotho Highlands water project, a project part-funded by the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">Since corrupt practices in the award of contracts for development projects represents a major threat to the provision of good governance, would you agree, Mr Maystadt, that it is crucial that the EIB examine its due diligence procedures, with respect not only to the Lesotho project, but also to all future projects, and will you report back to Parliament on its findings?</p>

<p class="contents">This Bank performs a special task: the distribution not of all funds, but only of funds intended to contribute to the achievement of the Union’s objectives. This institutional task has helped to create new wealth and to support entrepreneurial initiatives in the regions of the Union which are most lagging behind. The Bank’s efforts to support certain sectors, such as the environment sector, where EUR 5.9 billion has been allocated to environmental protection projects, are certainly commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important aspect for territorial development is still support for SMEs. In this case, partner banks which also distribute funds need to provide detailed information about the investments. It has therefore been suggested that a credit ceiling is set in advance for SMEs and that, at the end of the financial year, a report is submitted to the European Parliament on the actual use of the pre-established ceiling and on any reasons or difficulties encountered which caused it not to be used, or only to be used in part.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly support the major undertaking of the EIB in the candidate countries, but objective 1 regions should not be forgotten: even after they no longer have this status, they should be monitored as appropriate and given substantial credit support so that they can conclude their development process – certainly not fully completed – by 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">We should pay special attention to the Bank’s Statute, which can only be amended in accordance with the procedure for amending and revising the Treaties laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union. In particular, Article 5, which provides for 6% to be paid in by the signatory Member States, should be amended. An increase in this percentage would lead to higher loans and, consequently, greater support for the areas concerned, and greater profitability for the Bank or, alternatively, with the same amount of revenue, a reduction in the applicable rates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have had the satisfaction of working on EIB matters for many years, and I often say that it is more difficult getting into the EIB than into Fort Knox. It is still a hard fight to obtain greater transparency and supervision where the EIB is concerned. The bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision. It is almost impossible for the Court of Auditors to obtain access to documents. The bank always refers to banking secrecy or to the fact that the money does not come from the EU budget but from its own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 1999, the EIB, the Commission and the Court of Auditors signed an agreement concerning the Court of Auditors’ being able to supervise the EIB, but I firmly believe that the agreement must be altered so that it gives the Court of Auditors the same right to supervise the EIB as it has to supervise the ECB. I am extremely pleased, moreover, that Parliament is now making this demand. Why should the EIB have special status? That is something I absolutely cannot accept. I would compare the EIB with the goblins’ bank in the Harry Potter books, namely a totally closed institution in which no one must interfere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two weeks ago in Vienna, speaking before the annual European Investment Bank Forum, President Cox recalled the historical importance of enlargement and emphasised, with particular eloquence, that this move is the essential extension of the work towards peace and stability commenced by the founders of European integration. For its own, modest, part, the European Investment Bank, which was created by the Treaty of Rome for the purpose of providing financial support for the political objectives of the European Community, is trying to contribute to successful enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank, which already has a portfolio of loans of around EUR 18 billion in this region, making it by far the main backer, will, of course, continue to back the necessary investments in the future Member States. Three areas in particular are targeted: infrastructures, with particular regard to transport, energy and telecommunications; the environment, because tremendous investment is needed in order to achieve compliance with Community standards; and, lastly, direct foreign investment, because it is a particularly powerful tool in bringing conditions in the candidate countries into line with those in the current Member States. The preparation of the candidate countries for accession is therefore one of five priority axes adopted by the Council of Governors of the EIB last June, when it agreed to a 50% capital increase for the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes. First of all, regional development, with a view to devoting 70% of our direct loans and at least 50% of our global loans to projects based in regions eligible for assistance under the Structural Funds. Then what we call the i2i (Initiative innovation 2000) programme, which was implemented following the Lisbon European Council and which aims to encourage investments that contribute to transforming the European economy into an economy based on knowledge and innovation. Over EUR 13 billion of loans have already been approved within the context of this initiative. Another priority axis is environmental protection and improvement, with the objective of devoting between one quarter and one third of our total loans each year to environmental projects. The fifth and final priority axis is our support for the European development aid policy, in particular with the launch of two new facilities: the Euro-Mediterranean Facility, which was established by the Barcelona European Council, and the new Investment Facility created by the Cotonou agreement between the European Union and the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Having thus briefly summarised the five priority axes for the coming years, I would now like to try to respond to the various speakers. I confirm that I will be available to give fuller, more precise answers at committee meetings. I would like first of all to respond to your rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has put a great deal of effort into preparing this excellent report. I would like briefly to raise a subject close to her heart: the use of EIB bonds by pension funds. In the United Kingdom, pension funds have already invested in long-term EIB bonds. We have not yet had the same success on the euro market, but we are trying to find formulas that might be of greater interest to pension funds and insurance companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment, which many of you have continued to focus on, clearly constitutes a final objective. I believe, however, that it would be dangerous to make the number of jobs created directly by a project the deciding factor in the decision on whether to finance the project. In this regard, I share some of the reservations expressed by Mrs Peijs. We consider that our project must have a positive impact on the economy, through the innovation-productivity-growth-employment chain, but that it would be dangerous to establish too direct a link between the number of jobs created and the choice of a particular project.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financing of SMEs, I would remind you that we finance small and medium-sized enterprises in two ways: on the one hand, through global loans, as half of our global loans go to small enterprises, and, on the other, through the provision of risk capital from the European Investment Fund. I would say to the Commission, in response to the comment by Commissioner Monti echoing one of the report’s recommendations, that, in fact, we plan to adopt the Commission’s definition of small and medium-sized enterprises. We must, however, first solve one problem, which is that of medium-sized enterprises. The latter are in danger of being considered too large to receive global loans but too small to benefit from direct loans. When we have found the appropriate method for medium-sized enterprises, we will in effect be able to adopt the Commission’s definition.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the important matter of monitoring the European Investment Bank, I would say that, naturally, we are entirely open to monitoring by the Court of Auditors within the scope of its competence. Mr Blak, I can assure you that the Court of Auditors has access to all the documents it wishes to obtain within the context of the tripartite agreement concluded between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. This agreement operates to the satisfaction of all three parties. The President of the Court of Auditors confirmed this to me and you have just heard Commissioner Monti say that the Commission, too, is satisfied with this agreement, which will be renegotiated and renewed. In this regard, there is therefore no problem. The Court of Auditors has the power to monitor the use of Community funds and, insofar as the EIB uses Community funds, the Court of Auditors must clearly be fully able to exercise its monitoring powers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, however, the sector of EIB activities which have nothing to do with Community funds and are financed by our earnings from financial markets all over the world. These activities, naturally, also need monitoring. Moreover, it is in our interests to be monitored effectively, and we are already monitored by a verification committee and external auditors who report directly to the governors. That said, I think it would be desirable to find a form of supervision that is appropriate for a bank. I have already said this before the House, and I confirm it today. We are entirely open to the idea, and even keen to be subject to a form of banking supervision. Furthermore, that is why we are following with great interest the discussions taking place on the possible creation of a European banking supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lucas raised some interesting points, but I have already exceeded my speaking time. I will be able to give her more information in committee, in particular with regard to the Lesotho project she mentioned. I can simply confirm that, as soon as we became aware of signs of possible fraud, we ordered a detailed audit and communicated the information assembled during this audit to both Olaf, the monitoring body with which you are familiar, and to the Lesotho legal institutions. We did not uncover any fraud with regard to the use of EIB funds, but our enquiry at that time enabled us to discover other factors which we communicated to the competent authorities. I shall be able to say more about this in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I hope that the House has found my response informative and that it has given you an idea of the way in which we and all the Bank’s staff view our responsibilities and intend to put them into practice over the coming years, in close cooperation with the Commission and maintaining dialogue with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
