<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are dealing with here is the integrated management of our external borders, which is where, I am sure that we are all agreed, security, for the European Union, begins. They are also the starting point for defence against such menaces as organised crime, terrorism, smugglers, and illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">We know, though, that our external borders continue to be the weakest link in our internal security system as a whole, and the reasons for this are well known. They have to do with the different ways in which Schengen is interpreted, with differences in technical standards, and with the various agencies engaged in border control, with differences in training and, in general terms, with the lack of any Community, or even joint, action in matters concerning border control.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, we want to improve border security and hence make the EU more secure, we need equally high standards on all our external borders, both as they are at present and as they will be in the future, all of us being aware that the EU is about to be enlarged and that this demands that action be taken. The security that we are aiming for is something on which our internal security as a whole depends, as also does our ability to make a reality of the fundamental principle of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiatives taken by the Laeken European Council in December 2001, when it mandated the Commission and the Council to take appropriate steps to deal with this. I certainly welcome the Commission proposal, congratulate the Commissioner on the excellence of his preparatory work, and welcome the Council's plan of action. On these things there is broad agreement. I can also tell you – and I am glad to be able to do so – that these proposals met with broad consensus in the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, therefore, to express my gratitude for the close cooperation, which has seen all parties united in a concern for security. I believe that, in going ahead in this way, we have set a very good example, and I would be delighted if the same broad support and consensus were to be demonstrated tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, are the crucial points in my report, on which there is such agreement? I would like to single out five of them. The first is that we need to analyse and redefine the tasks involved and establish a common set of legal regulations. In order to do this, we also need to analyse the operational practice involved in the transposition of the Schengen acquis, which we know varies to a large extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Common Manual on border control should be revised to include the common standards and to take account of best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as particularly important that we should have not merely a Common Manual, but should also establish a monitoring body to verify, at regular intervals, that the provisions are being implemented and adhered to, which is what common standards and high quality are all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Leading on from that, the second priority is joint training and re-training. We must at long last give tangible effect to Article 7 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement. We are already engaged in drawing up a common core curriculum for border guards. What we need, however, in order to create a multiplier effect so that high standards may be guaranteed in the long term, is the establishment of a European Staff College for the training of senior officials, which should be supported through the ARGO programme, thus enabling the standard of training, as well as the common operating standards, to be maintained in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is that the equipment used should be interchangeable. In this area, there is a lack of compatibility within the Member States, and practical cross-border cooperation is made utterly impossible by the completely incompatible technical standards involved. If we go over to using shared satellite or radar systems or start cooperating across borders, then compatible equipment becomes an absolute necessity. It would, moreover, make sense in the future – for reasons of economics as much as any other reason – to have these standards in the joint procurement of technical systems, which can be very expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we should carry out an ongoing risk analysis. As Europol also has systems for analysing organised crime, we should have them carry out a risk analysis, the results of which – reporting on situations and outlining any assistance needed – would be communicated to the Member States and made available in order to make the common standards a reality here. It would be desirable – and, in terms of increased efficiency, an overall objective – for data to be exchanged between the Schengen, Europol and Eurodac systems, with, of course, all necessary data protection provisions being adhered to. There is no doubt that this could achieve certain synergies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth priority is that a European Corps of Border Guards should be established, made up of specialist units and with Community funding, which would, in an emergency and at the request of the Member States, support the national authorities at vulnerable border points for limited periods. This would enable us not only to achieve an optimum standard of security at particularly vulnerable sections of our external borders, but also to share the burden of dealing with a specific situation on the external border, which the country involved cannot be expected to bear alone. By doing this, we would be providing assistance and sharing a burden, although it has to be said that, in principle, general competence in matters of control of the external borders should remain at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope that all this agreement will give us the necessary stimulus to at last bring about in reality what we owe to the public – a greater degree of security even when enlargement has taken place. We can get down to work. Parliament will give its full support to the endeavours of the Commission and the Council if they go down this road.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Hubert Pirker for his report, which has focused not only on the Commission communication on the management of the EU’s external borders, but also on the action plan adopted by the Council. We might also say that the two documents, the Commission proposal and the Council action plan, contain a great deal of common ground. I believe that, in fact, the four fundamental objectives that were set for us at Laeken form part of this action plan: increasing mutual trust between the Member States with regard to controlling our external border, which is a common border, which means that poor control over the border in one State has inevitable knock-on effects on the security of all the other Member States of the European Union, the effectiveness of the fight against illegal immigration, the particular priority that must be given to controlling the external borders to prevent the entry of terrorist groups or agents and, finally, to safeguard the high level of internal security in the European Union, without which we cannot preserve freedom of movement and the abolition of controls at our external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Pirker emphasised, the objectives of this action plan are clear; and I believe that, rather than talking about objectives, we must define targets and work out what actually needs to be done. Firstly, in the legislative field. We have the Schengen acquis, that, as Mr Pirker quite rightly underlined, is implemented very differently in the various States. We need to harmonise the way in which the Schengen acquis is implemented and we are doing so in two ways: firstly by revising the Common Schengen Manual, and the Commission will, in the first six months of this year, be submitting a proposal for this revision. Secondly, however, by also establishing a code of good practice for establishing common standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is the training of border guards. I believe that, at this very moment, a meeting is taking place in Vienna, in which the Commission is participating, to define a proposal for a common curriculum for the training of border guards. This project is being led by Austria and by Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is to use modern information technologies to improve the control of our external borders. In this field, the Commission plans at the Salonika European Council, this coming July, to present a viability study into the launching of the on-line visa system at European level. We will similarly be presenting the first proposals on the control of the European Union’s external sea borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth objective is to define a common risk analysis model for controlling our external borders. In this field we already have a model, defined on the basis of a proposal presented by the Government of Finland, and a first meeting was held under the Danish Presidency of the so-called ‘SCIFA+’, which is the body that coordinates the border control services of all the Member States of the European Union. As a result of the functioning of this new body at European level it has been possible to develop, as early as in 2002, two practical operations. The first was the operation ‘Ulysses’, which was coordinated by Spain and involved joint teams from various Member States on controlling the Mediterranean; and the second was the operation of a joint team led by Germany to control its land borders. These two operations were, in 2002, funded by the ARGO Programme and new actions for operational cooperation have already been presented for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Seville European Council supported the principle of sharing responsibilities for controlling the external borders. This is a sharing of responsibilities in financial terms, in terms of sharing equipment and also with a view to creating, eventually, a common border guard force. The Commission presented an initial evaluation of the financial situation. We must acknowledge that the data that the Member States provided us with on the real expenditure of each of them on controlling the external borders were very different and were hard to compare. The Commission therefore requested further clarification and intends, during the Greek Presidency, to propose criteria for sharing financial responsibility for controlling the external border of the European Union. I hope that, with the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Pirker, which will be voted on here tomorrow, Parliament will be able to give a decisive boost to this ambitious, demanding and crucial programme of action to control the external border of the European Union in order to enhance the domestic security of all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The signing in 1990 of the Schengen Agreement and the abolition of controls at national borders have made controls at the external borders even more important in preventing threats to our citizens’ security from entering the Community area.</p>
<p class="contents">The growing threats from terrorism, organised crime, the trafficking in human beings and from drugs and illegal immigration have moved to the top of our political agenda and have become a core concern of our citizens. It is a matter for some regret, however, that our external borders continue to constitute a weak link in the overall system, which endangers not only the effective protection of internal security but also the full implementation of the principle of free movement. This situation takes on even more significance as a result of enlargement, when the new Member States will gradually take over the task of ensuring security at the external borders, with a considerable proportion of responsibility being transferred to those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial for the Union to adopt coherent measures on security at its borders, without infringing Member States’ own competences, but helping to increase the effectiveness of this protection. I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, that it is vital to develop a common policy of control for our current and future external borders, which requires common standards to be established for external border management, a common guideline and a common core curriculum for the officials concerned, a European Staff College for senior officials, priority for funding projects for establishing common standards, a jointly-funded European Corps of Border Guards, consisting of specialist units, which would, in an emergency and at the request of the Member States, be temporarily seconded to assist national authorities at vulnerable sections of the EU’s external borders and in crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">These common measures must also contribute to solving problems that we are seeing today, in the level of transposition of the Schengen acquis at the current external borders with regard to the type and practices of border control, which differ between land and sea borders, with regard to who is responsible for border management, which varies from Member State to Member State, even resulting, in some cases, in the duplication of competences and, finally, with regard to the use of different technologies that are sometimes incompatible and hamper the achievement of a uniformly high level of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by repeating the words of Commissioner António Vitorino: this concern to better manage our external borders must contribute to increasing internal security in the Union and in the Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free movement within the Union is one of the most cherished achievements for this House and for many citizens in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules which regulate the free movement of persons within the Union are Community rules. Many of the measures it has been necessary to establish in order to guarantee it are scattered around our legislation. To guarantee this free movement requires a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States, particularly in the management of external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">There is plenty of information on the reality of the situation to demonstrate that we have difficulties here, including the arrival on the coasts of the south of the European Union of people who hope that this will be the first stage of a journey but for whom it is often dramatically the last, the women rescued on a daily basis from their captors and exploiters, who offer them to Europeans who ask no questions about their origin, or the tragic spectacle we have witnessed for months in relation to the Sangatte centre.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the European Commission has raised the need to deal with this issue correctly and in a timely manner. Firstly, because the enlargement of the European Union obliges us to do so. Secondly, because their proposal is a good signal to the Convention that it should resolve the legislative mess involving one of the Union’s fundamental distinguishing marks; internal free movement. Thirdly, because it presents today, with the legal framework we have – and perhaps also the financial framework – the possibility of making progress on this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the notion that there is room to better guarantee both the freedom of security of those people who are in Community territory and the situation of those who wish to pass through it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and despite our extremist tendencies, the Socialist Group will vote in favour of the Pirker report. I hope that the enthusiasm and broad support of this House are contagious and that the Council will go beyond its political declarations and actively and enthusiastically support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted, moreover, it will, of course, in itself have no direct legal effects. Rather, the motion and the Commission’s communication will acquire significance in the light of a series of other decisions concerning the development of police cooperation. In this context, the proposal signifies a development that, in my view, is a threat to democratic control and the rule of law. This is a policy that would considerably weaken the national authorities in favour of the EU authorities. The unmistakeable ambition is to develop a supranational border police force in the longer term, one of several steps on the road towards an actual federal police force. This expansion of the police service is, at one and the same time, about unthinking EU integration and the securing of Fortress Europe. The latter is an obvious consequence of that outside pressure that is due to the prosperity of the EU countries as compared with the wretched social conditions endured by our neighbours, a contrast basically due to the EU countries’ policy, pursued for many years, of exploiting our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the motion’s real background. The content of the motion is no less alarming. The common legislative body, the system of coordination and operational cooperation, the interoperational facilities and the permanent exchange of information and data, in short the overall development of the police service, does nothing less than dismember that rule of law which, on the basis of experience in the Nordic countries, I see democratic activists as having sought to establish over the years. What does the Commission have to say about democratic and judicial control? What we have is a non-binding and ill thought-out policy to the effect that control must be ensured. How? No answer. What does the report have to say? Not a word. EU border police and a common body for external borders? No thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very topical subject, as has been pointed out, if you consider that the Union’s current external borders will be radically changed and extended in May 2004 when the 12 new Member States become part of the political and geographical structure of the current European Union. It is therefore more than appropriate that we should now be proposing the model used thus far on the basis of the consolidated experience of the 15 current Member States before the entry of the new candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pirker report drops into this wide-ranging framework a number of practical proposals on how to achieve integrated management of our external borders, without interfering in the territorial sovereignty of the individual States but rather defining the ideal formulae for harmonious cooperation. This is an acceptable approach which will involve the creation of a Community corps of border guards in the coming years – not straightaway but after we have fine-tuned techniques and procedures with appropriate measures for training staff and achieving cooperation between the different current corps of border guards. Hitherto impromptu experiments with mixed patrols have yielded excellent results. As far as my country, Italy, is concerned, these have been developed on borders with Member States such as France and Austria and on borders with third countries such as Switzerland too, and with a candidate country, Slovenia.</p>
<p class="contents">The section which addresses the issue of combating illegal immigration is extremely innovative. This involves a difficult, daily undertaking, particularly on the part of border States such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. However, the problem is everybody’s problem, not just the problem of these States, for, thanks to Schengen, an illegal immigrant who succeeds in penetrating the Adriatic coast has automatic access to many other Member States, at least those in the Schengen Area, which therefore have a major responsibility as well as a great opportunity. Therefore, the rapporteur is right to propose to call upon all the countries to work together to contribute to and bear the costs of external border controls, whether they have external borders or not. Indeed, it would appear to be clear that it is appropriate for all the countries to contribute if we are to achieve an effective control and monitoring service, particularly in the places where the flow of illegal immigrants is currently greatest – a genuine flood of new illegal immigrants is, even as we speak, pouring into the Union – for this is not just a problem for those who are directly involved in the daily fight against illegal immigration: it is also a problem for all those countries which are the automatic destinations of these illegal flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council for bringing this forward and recognising the need for further cooperation in this field, a very difficult area.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree, to an extent, with Mr Krarup, in that this is an issue that no one country can address on its own. It is vital that there are common policies, agreements and understandings between the 15 Member States. Having said that, we recognise the different situations in each Member State. Mrs Terrón i Cusí spoke earlier about the situation on the southern border of Spain. My own country, the United Kingdom, consists of one large island plus the north of Ireland. Other countries each have their own circumstances that need to be addressed: Greece, for example, has some 400 islands, and Luxembourg is land-locked. We all have very different situations and, in their own ways, these are very difficult to monitor and manage. But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment. Mr Coelho quite rightly drew attention to the fact that when we are 25 countries in the EU – and later on 27 or 28 – it will be even more challenging. It is very important that we at least make the effort to get into position now something that is trying to address the issue, trying to face up to the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make certain that we respect the rights of the individual. I agree with Mr Krarup on that. We can only do this if Member States work together, if we copy good practice from one country to another, if we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past. Effectively, this means border management, hand-in-hand with common policies on asylum and immigration. It means being prepared to constantly update and upgrade, and it means border management which takes account of citizens' rights of movement. If we put those together we will address the issues for the years ahead in an enlarged European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was whether the Commission regarded a common framework for border control as necessary; and the second was whether the Commission believed that the candidate countries would be in a position to secure their borders with countries outside the EU to the same high standard of protection as the existing Member States already did. The Commissioner's reply was that the candidate countries would have no problem with guaranteeing a satisfactory level of protection on their own, and that there was no need for a European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now changed its mind and presented a sensible proposal for a common framework for control of our external borders. Mr Pirker's report supports it and adds to it at various points, and Mr Coelho is unfortunately no longer here to hear me say that it goes without saying that I wholeheartedly support it too. It is to be regretted that Commissioner Verheugen has wasted a lot of valuable time by talking rubbish. One example of why this is a matter of urgency is the border between Germany and Poland, 456 kilometres long and formed by a river, where traffic across it is at present monitored by some 10 000 border guards. Poland's border with its non-EU neighbours is over 1 200 kilometres long and runs across fields for the whole of its length. The belief that, within the next few years, Poland will be able to secure this border on its own in anything like the same way as external borders used to be secured, is utterly illusory.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where European solidarity is needed, as the defence of the external borders by a number of Member States is to the ultimate benefit of all Member States. Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control. Any European concept of external border control must, at the end of the day, be enshrined in the Treaties, both by the allocation of combined powers to the EU and, on the other hand, by giving it institutional form as a European body in parallel with Europol and Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">And, in these present times, as Cato did in the senate of ancient Rome, I will end all my speeches with the same words: Commissioner Vitorino, I wish that the Convention would demonstrate greater courage in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before wishing you good-night, I would of course like to avail myself of the opportunity to tell you what I think and, as one who comes from Germany, to set out in clear terms the importance of external border control, Germany being, as Mr von Boetticher has just said, a country with a vast external border.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, we are very glad that you have presented this communication, and also that the report by the PPE-DE Group's Mr Pirker has proposed the right thing and enjoys our support for that reason. I assume that Parliament's united manifestation of agreement with the Commission in this area will, perhaps with the Greek Presidency's help, make it possible to win the Council over, as the Greek Presidency has already signalled the importance it attaches to combating illegal immigration and smugglers of any kind. I have high hopes of them.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament does of course have Members who persist in regarding the reinforcement of police or border control units as problematic, and who tell us how much better all these things should be done. Over and over again, they ask why we need the police so much. I can tell them in all frankness that I should prefer to deploy as many police officers as possible and have a secure border that prevents refugees escaping to their deaths. I become really fed up with it all and find myself thinking that the responsibility must be shouldered by us all together. We cannot keep on standing idly by while people die, and the only way we can prevent people dying is if our borders are secure and illegal immigrants are no longer exploited or abused by gangs of smugglers. It is for that reason that I hope we can all reach our objective together. Good night. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
