I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Harbour, whom I again have had the privilege of working with; we work well together.</p>
<p class="contents">As many Members will realise, this is the second phase in the reform of the Commission, a reform which this whole House has endorsed previously. If we believe in the reform process, we must endorse this second phase, which concerns the introduction, on a one-off basis, of the early retirement scheme for officials within the Commission. A proper retirement scheme will apply at a later date, but this particular one is on a one-off basis.</p>
<p class="contents">If we believe in enlargement to accommodate the officials from accession countries, we must reduce the number of existing officials and do so within the existing budget. Also, if we believe in a modern, responsive, technically competent Commission, then we must look to bring in new blood to replace some of those officials who have not adapted or coped with the new technology. All this adds up to some people taking early retirement and to allowing new people and new blood in. But it also adds up to some of us within this House having to take decisions, which previously were not palatable. We have, however, to live in the real world and therefore we must take those decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the amendments, that I will be supporting all the amendments except for two submitted by Mr Ferber. Initially I was reluctant to put my name to some of the amendments, as I was concerned that the inclusion of the other institutions might delay the implementation of the early retirement scheme. However, my fears have proved unfounded and I am hopeful that the scheme will be implemented in the second half of this year. It will also allow the other institutions to go ahead with implementing their own scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the two amendments submitted by Mr Ferber, first of all they have come in rather late in the day. Secondly, they were never raised or discussed within the committee. Apart from all that, I see these amendments as being submitted by a mean, narrow-minded individual who wants to put a spanner in the works. This is the only way I can really describe it. I cannot accept such a petty attempt to derail this whole process and I hope Parliament cannot accept such a petty attempt to derail the reform process of the Commission. Therefore I would ask the House to support this report as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I would like to thank Bill Miller for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work. It is a pleasure to see our roles reversed, since he shadowed me on the report on the overall strategy for the human resource reforms that this House approved at the end of last year. Together we have gathered the experience on what are absolutely crucial issues, both for the future of the Commission and, indeed, for the future of the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good, from the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee, that we are now getting on with the task of making the crucial reforms to the Staff Regulations that will be needed to implement these reforms. We hope to carry them out thoroughly and quickly, as Commissioner Kinnock forwards them to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much echo what Bill Miller said about the importance of this measure as a one-off package. It does need to be seen in that context. It is encouraging that the Commission realises that this crucial step towards an entirely new human resource policy, means creating a whole new culture where people are promoted on merit, where we have a linear grading structure, where there is not an artificial ceiling for promotion, where there is much more delegated accountability. This is part of that transitional phase and it is encouraging that the Commission wants to tackle this seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have asked in our committee, and the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets have also looked at this, is whether this is the right package. It is clearly a very generous package, but at the same time it has to be a powerful package because otherwise it will not work. The worst thing we could possibly do is make an offer which nobody takes up. That would frustrate what the Commission is trying to do. In that context I can tell Mr Miller that I am not supporting the two late amendments. They will not be on the EPP voting list. We have a consensus on that.</p>
<p class="contents">So we believe this is the right package, but I commend the way that Bill Miller has sought to tighten up some aspects, particularly those relating to Commission officials who may take the retirement package and then go on to take up other jobs. Clearly it is not reasonable that they should effectively be rewarded twice at the European taxpayers' expense. I hope the Commission will accept those sensible provisions that Bill Miller has put into the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish again to support the amendments that extend the application of this scheme to both the European Parliament and the political groups. That is a recognition of our dual role. We must not just hold the Commission to account for the progress of these reforms, but also look at our own management policies within this institution. It is quite clear that we have to address exactly the same issues. This is a once-off package that is not setting a precedent for the future reform of pensions policy. You will recall that in my report I attached great importance to the need to reform the standing pensions policy to introduce a permanent early retirement scheme. But this package is disconnected from that, and quite rightly so. This is a very important step in the reform of the Commission and I am pleased to give it, on behalf of my group, our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that Commissioner Kinnock is demonstrating his great parliamentary experience by negotiating this rather complex issue in a very efficient manner and I will simply make an observation on what we might call Mr Harbour’s <span class="italic">obiter dictum</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Socialist Group, it is essential that the rights of officials be recognised, including acquired rights, as well as the existence of an administrative career path, and that it be recognised that officials of the European institutions are of high quality and have carried out very efficient work. Therefore, the officials should not be pursued, as it appears these last minute amendments intend to do, but this Community administration should be rapidly transformed without abandoning the essential principles of recognising an independent civil service and recognising an administrative career path.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we agree with the proposals in the Miller report on the extending the facilities enjoyed by Commission officials to the officials of the other institutions, including the European Parliament, which I believe will take a favourable view of the amendments we are presenting, which, in summary, recognise the good work done by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">So it only remains for me to congratulate Mr Miller on his report and Mr Kinnock on the skilful, capable and progressive way in which he has dealt with this first administrative reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like the previous speaker, we accept this proposal as a one-off measure, a necessary measure in order to take the reforms forward. We also believe that it is cost-neutral. We are also pleased that the Commission has realised that the other institutions must have similar rights, that this will be included in the scheme and that it will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">When we compare our institutions, I would like to warn the Commissioner about one point, namely about accepting the promotion system which we have in the European Parliament. I have heard that the Commission is interested in this, but I have unfortunately received indications that there will be no real assessment of the actual knowledge of various employees as the assessment is a “zero sum game”.

The shadow rapporteurs no doubt also had a hand in this. Neither are my thanks diminished by the fact that the rapporteur has called 32 Members, of which I am one, a group of narrow-minded individuals. Nevertheless you will of course allow me first of all to repudiate this description here.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of a minority in our group, I should like to express a number of reservations which we have on the proposal. It is proposed, in the extreme case, that an official who has worked in the Commission for ten years and who is 50 years of age be given early retirement with an allowance of 65% of his salary. We do not believe that a lucrative, generous early retirement scheme of this kind can be justified to the European taxpayer. When we have spent the whole day talking about the Irish referendum in the corridors and when we are always talking here about proximity to the people, may I please ask who can actually explain to a pensioner who has paid into a pension scheme for 40 years why a 50-year-old A3-grade official should be given EUR 5 500 to go for walks in the country?</p>
<p class="contents">No one is able to explain to me why the Commission, which has 18 000 posts, is nevertheless not in a position usefully to deploy 600 officials who are obviously no longer productive. Neither is anyone able to tell me why this should now be an essential component of this Commission reform. I fear, you see, that there will be crafty, shrewd and smart officials who will succeed in benefiting from this golden handshake. In the end the good ones will go, the bad ones will stay, EUR 16 million will be spent and everyone will be disgraced! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Inside the Commission, it has emerged that over 1200 posts needed to achieve fundamental strategic objectives are unfilled. According to the Commission, part of that deficit can be made up by rationalising and redistributing the existing workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">That approach deserves support, but it anticipates that some members of staff are not capable of adapting to the new tasks. To solve the problem, the need arises to give such staff incentives to choose favourable, mutually agreed early retirement as a unique, one-off package.</p>
<p class="contents">This hypothesis rightly recognises the past contribution of the staff involved, and gives them the option of alternative employment elsewhere. The Union does not suffer economic overload and it is not obligatory to take the package.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, my verdict is positive. However, I do not support the Ferber amendments. Reform is an exceptional event and should be regarded as such. I would like to express great appreciation of the rapporteur’s really excellent and influential work, and the same appreciation applies to the proposals from the heads of delegations, which extend that solution to all the institutions of the Union. Finally, great appreciation is due to all the employees of the Union, those who choose early retirement and those who remain in working life, because it is also thanks to their enthusiastic work that Europe continues to advance briskly towards the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and specifically the rapporteur, Mr Miller, for this very constructive report on the Commission's proposal for a time and numbers-limited early retirement scheme. I know that the speedy drafting and consideration of the report owes a great deal to the enthusiasm and hard work of Mr Miller, and indeed of his shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour. Whilst expressing gratitude to both of them I would also like to express my thanks to the House for agreeing to bring forward consideration of this report in plenary. As several Members may know, that assists the Commission in its efforts to sustain progress with the reform and modernisation that Parliament has called for and to do so in good time, so that if everything else goes well it can to implement at least the first part of the scheme by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House may recall, in our reform strategy White Paper in March last year we announced our intention to undertake a reallocation of human resources across departments in order, specifically, to concentrate activities more precisely on core policy objectives and to achieve a better balance between the tasks assigned to the Commission and the resources available to it. We then set up a Commissioners' group under President Prodi to make a thorough analysis. That assessment showed that even after the rationalisation efforts carried out in 1999 and 2000 there was a shortfall of 1 254 posts in relation to Commission staff members assigned to priority activities. In order to make a significant contribution to closing that gap we then specified the ways in which further rationalisation of activities, productivity gains and internal redeployment would enable us to meet two-thirds of those requirements from within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to measures which enabled redeployed staff to perform other higher priority activities, we also proposed that explicit termination of service arrangements should be made available so that over a two-year period the Commission could offer reasonable severance conditions to 600 officials whose skills are not easily adaptable to the changed and changing needs and tasks of the institution. The purpose of the proposed regulation being considered by the House is, therefore, to authorise such a termination of service scheme for 300 Commission officials in the course of this year, and another 300 in the course of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is based on the same mechanism that has been used in previous termination of service regulations related, for instance, to successive enlargements of the Union or to renewal of responsibilities in the on research directorate-general. Application for inclusion in the scheme is therefore voluntary, but the new scheme differs from previous ones, particularly on the following major points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, candidates for early retirement will be selected solely according to the interests of the services. Secondly, financial conditions are set at a lower level – 65% of final salary instead of 70% – than has been customary in all previous termination of service arrangements. Thirdly, this early retirement proposal has a neutral budgetary impact. The difference between the cost of the total remuneration of 600 officials before termination of service and the cost of the allowance they will receive afterwards will finance the recruitment of 258 new officials. The 342 remaining posts will be given back to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">These elements of the new scheme will help to ensure the achievement of the overall objective of gaining a better match between Commission tasks and resources. It will also ensure that the ceiling of Heading 5 of the financial perspective is fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Miller, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 9, which asks for the expenditure for the early retirement scheme to remain non-compulsory. We cannot accept that amendment simply because of the statutory reality that allowances for officials who have left the service are legally defined as compulsory expenditure. Having made this point, I turn to the more positive and more complex position of the Commission on the other proposed amendments tabled by Mr Miller in the report. I will come to the amendments by Mr Ferber later on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 and which are aimed at ensuring that the arrangements of the scheme are properly implemented, that the measures under consideration do not preclude the adoption of a new permanent early retirement scheme for all of the institutions. As Miller said in his speech, these arrangements should be drawn up and adopted at the earliest possible opportunity. The amendments that I have just listed are also aimed at ensuring that further single measures of this kind should in future be unnecessary and, therefore, precluded.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are in line with the Commission's intentions as regards the implementation of the scheme and introduce improvements and refinements to the proposal that we originally submitted. We therefore welcome them very warmly. Since the Commission will soon be proposing the introduction of a permanent, flexible retirement scheme into the Staff Regulations, further single measures of this kind are highly unlikely to be necessary in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will know that the most important political points in the discussions on this early retirement scheme that have so far taken place in the Council and in Parliament relate to the fact that the proposed scheme only concerns the Commission, which is committed to implementing the scheme in a budgetary neutral way. In this context, I refer to Amendments Nos 1- 6, 12, 13 and 16, all of which seek to extend the field of application of the proposed regulation and require the participation of all European institutions and of Parliament's temporary staff in the early retirement scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the interest of Parliament and Council as employing institutions in this matter and, as Members of this House will know, I am not unsympathetic to their objectives. However, I wish to say most emphatically that, if progress is to be made to everyone's liking, budgetary neutrality must be observed in all of the institutions that implement a scheme of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three reasons for that. The first, very obviously, is the clear need for public understanding and acceptance. That in itself requires that any developments in this area should be budgetary neutral. Secondly, if the Commission alone guaranteed budgetary neutrality, the adoption of the scheme by the Council would be very unlikely indeed. Thirdly, heading 5 of the financial perspective provides budgetary means for all institutions. The margins for the years to come, which the Commission has promised to respect, would be further reduced if budgetary neutrality were not common to all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking these realities into account, it is clear that the success and the acceptance of the whole early retirement scheme may well depend on all institutions' accepting budgetary neutrality. In adopting Mr Miller's report, therefore, this House would need to confirm that its participation in an early retirement scheme will be subject to the same conditions as those applied by the Council and by the Commission. I am sure that that requirement is well understood and supported across this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, before responding to the two amendments tabled by Mr Ferber, I must say that I heard Mr Miller's comments on Mr Ferber's amendments and think that, whatever glorious future offers itself to my good friend Mr Miller, I can safely predict that he will not be made head of the diplomatic service. In response to Mr Ferber's amendments, the Commission feels that Amendment No 21 would significantly reduce the effective scope of the measure by restricting the number of eligible candidates for early retirement. Indeed the restriction would be so significant as to actually have an impact on the geographical balance of the scheme. That would clearly be unacceptable to the Commission and to the great majority of this House. Amendment No 22 by Mr Ferber would introduce new conditions, notably a 50% tax so negative and complex as to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the Commission's proposals. We cannot, therefore, accept that amendment either, and I hope that, on reflection, the honourable Member, Mr Ferber, whom I know very well and have every reason to respect, will understand and accept the Commission's view.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely grateful for the constructive approach taken in this report and, indeed, the improvements made on the original proposal, because it has received close and enthusiastic attention from Members of this House. I am sure that that constructive attitude will continue to characterise our discussions on reform, since as honourable Members know, I regard the understanding and support of this House for all our reform proposals to be absolutely critical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
