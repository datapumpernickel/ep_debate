<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thyssen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, the report I am about to present was approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy by just one vote short of unanimity. It concerns competition policy and two proposals in connection with vertical agreements. One proposal for an amendment concerns the first Council regulation on the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty. This is the famous Regulation No 17/62 which empowers the Commission to grant individual exemptions. The other concerns an amendment to Regulation No 19/65 which determines the Commission"s powers to grant block exemptions. It seems that the system of block exemptions, which the Commission has used for more than 30 years, is no longer flexible enough to meet the needs of rapidly changing distribution structures. There is also increasing recognition of the risk that agreements between undertakings with a dominant market position, even if they comply with the legal conditions for block exemption, may still have a distorting effect on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the Commission set out these and other findings and published a Green Paper on vertical agreements. Parliament also took the opportunity to give its opinion on this occasion. While we recognised the need for a change of policy we did not unconditionally share the Commission"s view that market share should be an essential differentiating criterion. With the current proposals, the Commission is introducing an initial specific amendment phase. The Commission wishes in future to introduce a single block exemption regulation for all categories of agreements on the resale of goods and services, intermediate goods and industrial property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, the scope of Regulation No 19/65 must first be extended. The Commission also wants to drop the excessively strict legal conditions in the area of contractual content. Furthermore, it wants to grant the national competition authorities the power to withdraw the benefit of block exemption in their territory. If all this is to be achieved within a consistent legal framework, the scope of Regulation No 17/62 also needs to be adapted, which the Commission also proposes to do. Finally, the Commission wants it to be possible for agreements which are not individually notified, but which nevertheless qualify for exemption, to be exempt with retroactive effect from the date on which they were concluded. These then are the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is in broad agreement with the Commission when it says that the proposed amendments will bring competition policy more in line with economic reality in future. But we also have certain objections. First of all, I must say that, contrary to what the Commission maintains, not all economic sectors welcome the proposed policy change. This is certainly true of the brewing sector and of filling station contracts. These are sectors with special rules which have shown their practical value. The beer supply contracts, for example, are currently perfectly satisfactory for the catering sector, large and small breweries, wholesalers and also the consumer. Yet the Commission claims that there are insufficient economic and legal arguments for maintaining special rules for them. My first question to the Commission is therefore: What compelling reasons does the Commission have for replacing an effective system which everyone is pleased with in this sector and which does not distort competition?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to hear from the Commission how the general block exemption will relate to the duration of contracts and in particular whether contracts linked to long‐term investments will be able to run for periods as long as at present?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I have a question about the transitional period for current agreements and wonder whether agreements made under the present system can be fully implemented under this system or whether the new system applies to them and, if so, from when?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like public confirmation of the Commission"s undertaking to inform Parliament and to give it the time to draw up a report on the planned block exemption regulation and guidelines before the Commission makes any final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I am curious to know what the Commission"s position is on Amendment No 9 relating to the professional secrecy of in‐house counsel and what position it intends to take on the automobile distribution sector when the block exemption regulation for this sector expires in 2002. I thank the Commissioner in advance for a clear reply on this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today debating one part of the overall package of reforms in European competition law. Mirroring the trend in the United States since the end of the last century, the European Union"s anti‐trust authority has become the spearhead of the EU. We need rules to safeguard the free market and to provide protection against monopolistic situations. Only competition can guarantee the lowest possible price for the consumer, quality, free access to the market, and, of course, innovation and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you quite rightly referred several times to the support which Parliament has offered up to now in its contacts with the relevant departments. The Commission can also count on Parliament playing a constructive part in future work on the reform of competition law. This of course includes a detailed analysis of the present communication which deals with vertical restraints on distribution. As a matter of principle, it is of course right to frame practical block exemption regulations. Let me say it again, practical. It is probably easier to assess the internal market situation by judging the impact of vertical agreements than by applying strict formal criteria, particularly as small economic operators would then benefit from simplified formalities. And we would be well advised to convince all sectors of the need for such a reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Marianne Thyssen, quite rightly points out that there is absolutely no obstacle either to exceptions being made or to sector‐specific approaches being adopted for those sectors in which the existing arrangements work to the total satisfaction of economic operators. Some distributional restraints reflect an economic requirement, for example because of the scale of investment or the consequent rate of return. At any rate, changes in sensitive areas should involve appropriate transitional periods. In my country alone, assets measurable in billions are dependent on this approach.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it is certainly laudable that the Commission, and above all the Commissioner responsible, Mr Van Miert – who is not with us today but to whom I should like to say that he for one clearly cannot be accused of having lost control of his administration – is seeking to ensure that the Treaty is properly applied in order to avoid any distortion of competition in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must guard against being over‐zealous by questioning something that has been shown to work effectively, especially if this review of competition policy on vertical restrictions threatens to jeopardise a whole sector which, thanks to its exclusive distribution contracts, and beer contracts in particular, has functioned perfectly well thus far, to the satisfaction of the breweries on the one hand and the cafés, restaurants and hotels on the other. As our rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, very clearly highlighted, the breweries invest in the buildings and equipment of their clients safe in the knowledge that they can then sell their perishable products there. The owners of cafés, restaurants and hotels benefit from these investments which they are unable to finance or finance in advance themselves. What is the harm in that?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must understand, and give us the assurance, that any reform must ensure that a brewery operator can conclude beer delivery contracts for at least 10 years, given the considerable volume of investments in this sector and the relatively long period before they yield a return.</p>
<p class="contents">In sectors such as beer, and also hydrocarbons, where the present approach is satisfactory to economic operators, either an exception must be made to the general rule or a sector‐specific approach adopted. There can be no question of giving the Commission carte blanche in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we want to hear from the Commission that it will accept Parliament"s argument and review its position. In a small country such as mine, Mr President, a new regulation on market thresholds could simply drive our breweries out of business. This must not be allowed to happen and the Commission must understand this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> The approval of the Green Paper in January 1997 marked the start of the Commission"s review of its competition policy in relation to distribution agreements. Since then we have received support for this review in the course of what has been a very open dialogue with Parliament. This support for one of the most important European competition policy reforms is clearly of great importance. The two proposals for Council regulations on the agenda today represent a second step in this process and should make it possible for the Commission to adopt new measures with regard to distribution agreements. I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, for the support she has given the Commission"s proposals in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Council has approved the Council regulation, the Commission will draw up a proposal for a block regulation covering all vertical agreements below a certain market threshold. At the same time it will propose draft directives for those agreements not covered by the block exemption. The European Parliament will be informed of both proposals before the Commission adopts the final texts. The Commission supports a number of the amendments that have been tabled. Let me tell you which amendments the Commission has difficulty with and cannot support. The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 2 on Regulation No 19/65 or Amendment No 1 on Regulation No 17. It is not the case that small and medium‐sized enterprises in the beer and petrol sector may suffer adverse effects as a result of the policy review. SMEs in all sectors will benefit from the deregulation while the use of market share thresholds will ensure that dominant companies are unable to block off the market to new entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why a number of breweries and beer wholesalers support the policy review whereas some dominant players are opposed. There are a number of beer markets where market dominance seems to be a problem, which only highlights the need to treat this sector just like any other. However, the directives will take into account the specific situation of long‐term investments in these and other sectors. For the same reason the Commission is unable to support Amendment No 3 on Regulation No 19/65. There should also be no need to stress that sector‐specific regulations remain possible as these are always possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has objections to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 concerning the principle of legal privilege for in‐house counsel. The law protects the confidentiality of written communication between an independent counsel and a company, therefore rendering it impossible for the Commission to use such documents as proof in applying European rules of competition. This protection is usually known as legal privilege. On the other hand, documents received or written by in‐house counsel for the enterprise for which he works are not protected. The proposed amendments propose extending the principle of legal privilege to include in‐house counsel. The Commission recognises the importance of this question but is unable to support the amendments, for three main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this question lies beyond the scope of the present policy review which is concerned with competition policy as it relates to vertical agreements. The Commission"s wide‐ranging consultation in connection with its Green Paper did not include the question of legal privilege for in‐house counsel. Accepting these amendments would mean changing the subject of the present legislative procedure and would result in a decision without prior consultation with all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are at present busy considering an extensive reform of Regulation No 17, including a review of the Commission"s powers of investigation. If any changes need to be made to the principle of legal privilege, it should be done in this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we do not believe that now is the time to resolve the question of legal privilege for in‐house counsel. The proposed extension of this principle requires a new European status for in‐house counsel, based on comparable rules on professional ethics and discipline. It will take some time to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mrs Thyssen has now supplemented her report with five or six questions, the first of which I propose to answer now, but I would ask Mrs Thyssen if she would be prepared to accept a written reply to the other questions tomorrow. I have noted them down here but in order to save time I should like to give a written reply.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Mrs Lulling"s question about the compelling reasons for changing the rules for the beer sector, the answer is that the present block exemption authorises market monopoly. No distinction is made as to whether a brewery controls 5 %, 30 % or 90 % of the cafés. That is not good policy as it does not protect competition. The present block exemption is also unnecessarily detailed in its formal requirements, resulting in unnecessary legal uncertainty. A good example of this is the British market. If there is no market monopoly then people have no reason to fear new regulations. This concludes my reply.</p>

It is not possible to set thresholds in a small country such as mine where a small brewery can dominate, but in a very limited market, whereas a major brewery such as ‘Bitburger", which is just next door to us and which is in a much stronger position and has a much bigger turnover, is not considered to be dominant because Germany is huge in comparison with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. It will be the death of our breweries, and this must not be allowed to happen. We will also discuss this with Mr Van Miert. I do not want to attack Mr van den Broek. It is not his sector, but we cannot accept answers like that. It is not being responsible.</p>

Of course I am prepared to accept written answers to my questions, but there is one question to which I should have liked to receive an oral reply because I believe it is important for this to be given in public. The question is whether the Commission will give an undertaking that its services responsible for competition policy will come to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy before the general block exemption regulation is finally adopted and before the guidelines are decided, and whether the Commission is ready to present the proposals to Parliament and we will have the chance to draw up another report on this. I feel that this is important if we are to consider the specific points raised by my colleagues in greater detail.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> On what Mrs Lulling said, it does indeed seem advisable, as she herself suggested, to take this point up with Commissioner Van Miert. I would of course like to give her a satisfactory answer now, but she has recognised that at the present time this is not really expected of me.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Thyssen, I would say that I thought I had answered her first question in my speech. From what I have gathered here, this block exemption is under a certain time pressure at the moment, so any consultation must take place within a very short period. The present block exemptions expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that where Mrs Thyssen talks about consultation, if I heard correctly, I myself thought Mr Van Miert was thinking more about providing information, though of course information can also lead to an exchange of views. This is simply how I see it.</p>

But we would very much like the opportunity to have an exchange of views on this issue before any final decision is taken. It was in this spirit that I drew up my report. In faithful cooperation with the Commission"s services I limited myself to the legal aspects on the agenda, precisely because we had received an undertaking that we would be able to return to the details later.</p>

It was Mr Speciale, the rapporteur on Slovenia, who drew my attention to my mistake. I referred to a number of areas in which Slovenia had fallen behind in preparations for accession, but I failed to mention the following positive points which I would like to be added to the report on the previous subject if this is possible. The words are as follows: since the publication of the interim report, however, more progress has been made, in other words more progress in the preparations for enlargement. A number of important laws have been passed, including in the areas of VAT, excise, company law and the bank act. A government programme has also been approved for 82 priority laws in connection with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> which will be enacted before the end of this year by means of shortened parliamentary procedures. Mr President, I would very much appreciate it if the rapporteur can be borne out on that point, and I also offer my apologies to Mr Speciale for this omission.</p>
