It is a programme to combat violence against women and children, essentially in the domestic environment. This violence is a serious violation of their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women results from the unequal relationship between men and women and the sex discrimination which exists in society. The fight against violence requires an integrated approach which combines prevention, dealing with aggressors and support for victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has carried out an exhaustive and rigorous mid-term assessment report on the programme, which allows us to make proposals for the future with a view to achieving the objective of ‘zero violence’.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women and children takes place in all countries, regardless of class, race or level of education. This violence is an obstacle to achieving equality and perpetuates inequalities. We must point out the insufficient budgetary contribution to this programme, which has only allowed a third of the projects presented to be funded. We must pay special attention to the prevention of violence, but also to the treatment and rehabilitation of aggressors in order to prevent re-offending. It is essential to create teaching programmes aimed at preventing violence, to be used in schools and adult education centres. We must involve all sectors of society in the fight against violence, and in particular the media, as opinion formers and instruments for the transmission of values, so that, by means of the media, a non-stereotypical image of women may be transmitted, also of children and of victims in general. The way news about acts of violence is transmitted is also essential to the subsequent evaluation of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGOs have played an important role in the fight against violence, but the public institutions must also be involved – so far only 10% of the programmes have been implemented by them – as well as universities and study and research centres. We need more information on real violence, since we only have knowledge of a small proportion of it. We must have common indicators and a common database.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States should update their legislation so that they have more appropriate instruments for combating violence. In certain countries there already exists the right to remove the aggressor from the shared home, with the corresponding accompanying measures. The victims must be protected and we must ensure that it is not they who have to flee and hide. Better police training in this field would be of great help.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE Programme should continue after this one ends, since the problem unfortunately persists and we know that it is difficult to eradicate, and therefore actions taken to increase awareness in society and try to change the sexist mentality which still persists must be welcomed. Amongst these measures we propose a European Year for combating violence against women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point to the need to change the legal basis of the Programme. This is the right time to do so, since the European Convention which is reviewing and updating the Treaty has the opportunity to modify it, and I would therefore affectionately ask Commissioner Vitorino, whose sensitivity towards all these problems we are well aware of, to insist, to apply pressure, to do everything humanly possible to introduce into the Treaty a legal basis which facilitates the fight against violence towards women and children throughout the European Union. I am aware of the difficulties involved in this, but I trust in your ability to achieve it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Avilés Perea on the excellent report she has presented to this plenary sitting today. I believe that the most important conclusion to be drawn from it is that the Commission and Parliament are agreed on uniting their efforts to combat the problems of violence, particularly problems of violence against women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is supporting this programme with the resolution that has been proposed, a programme that is still – I admit – modest, but which the Commission is extremely proud to have created. I particularly welcome the fact that the European Parliament acknowledges the success of the actions already undertaken and is warming to the idea that the programme must continue beyond 2003. The Commission, for its part, is ready to present the text of the decision on the new Daphne programme, in line with the concerns expressed in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this, however, I must address the issue that the rapporteur raised on the legal base of the programme. The Daphne programme today takes as its legal base Article 152 of the EC Treaty on health protection. The Article might appear to be far-removed from concerns about violence, but violence is clearly much more than simply a health issue, because it is also a health concern; involving both physical and psychological health.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree that violence against children and against women is an unacceptable breach of their rights as human beings. Nevertheless, within the scope of the Treaties in their current state, the Commission has no alternative but to initiate actions against violence under Article 152. This is the situation, regardless of the future position of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union, within the scope of the Treaty or outside it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the current situation must not prevent us from trying to improve it. The Commission will shortly be proposing a directive on equality between men and women outside the workplace. The directive will exclude action against violence, because its legal base, Article 13 of the Treaty, does not provide for actions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, for this very reason, pursue the discussion and I am pleased to note the suggestion of this House, which the rapporteur has just made, that the discussion of this matter by the Members of the Convention could focus on a proposal on violence, with its own specific legal base in the Treaty. Since I am one of the representatives of the Commission in the Convention, I shall certainly support Parliament’s request when the matter is discussed in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, in a discussion of this type we will have to take into consideration and balance the various competences between the States Members and the Union as a whole. In other words, if we – both the Parliament and the Commission – want a new Daphne Programme, which is ready to start at the beginning of 2004, the Commission has no alternative but to once again use Article 152 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of this programme is clearly expressed in the large number of projects that have been submitted. It must be acknowledged, however, that this sign of success is also a cause for concern. It means that the number of violent situations and the number of cases of violence against women and children in the countries of the European Union is still very high. Therefore, the rapporteur’s request for an increased budget is in line with the observations made by the Commission, especially if we bear in mind the expected increase in work in this field, following the accession of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the support given by this Parliament to the Daphne Programme, the suggestions contained in the motion for a resolution are useful and are fully in line with the discussions that have taken place in the Commission. I am referring, in particular, to the idea of giving priority to prevention, for which civil society, non-governmental organisations and the public authorities with competence in the field must be mobilised.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the concern to develop an ongoing educational programme in schools, and also in the media, to combat stigma and cultural prejudices that still predominate in our societies. I am referring most specifically to the need for common indicators and to the need to undertake a more comprehensive collection of data on violence at European level, because this situation is often hidden from view and disappears in official statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a need felt by the Commission and future activity could be tied in with the current action of setting up a network of experts on fundamental rights. In fact, following a request by the European Parliament, this new action to create a network of European experts in the field of fundamental rights under budget line B-5850 in 2002, which the Commission has already started to finalise, will enable a close relationship to be established between this network of experts and the objectives of the Daphne programme, in addition to emphasising something that is of considerable importance. This is the dimension of the breach of fundamental rights that all violence against women and children represents and which we shall continue to fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our mid-term report assesses how far we have come in raising awareness of the problem of violence and how to deal with it. However, the painful truth is that violence persists in our society, forcing us to adopt more radical and efficient measures, such as introducing a legal basis in the Treaty or organising a European year on this topic, as the rapporteur suggests. I, for one, am very keen to see a wide-ranging information campaign using every possible means and involving every agency in the overall campaign in the European Union and the candidate countries, which will reach small, particularly remote societies where, as we know, violence persists in the family, in schools and on the streets. And, over and above this objective, we need to encourage the whole of local society to get involved, as the Commissioner has already said.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking stock so far, we can see that, although the programme is open to regional and local authorities, their level of involvement is only somewhere in the region of 10%, while non-governmental organisations working at local and regional level are prevented from taking part by the need to create internal links by finding partners in other Member States and by the complicated management of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital, I think, that the final report contain an in-depth analysis of the quantitative and qualitative involvement of the various agencies and the mechanisms they use to cooperate and of the impact which the programmes have on local society. This will help us study and propose new ways of ensuring small agencies join the programme and areas in which little action has been taken so far, such as reviewing educational programmes which generate violence and educating teachers and journalists. Similarly, if we are to make better use of the programme, we need to look at it in relation to other, similar programmes, especially national programmes to reduce violence and help victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme has proven to be highly effective in combating violence against children, young people and women, even though it has had very little funding. Daphne was born of an initiative by Commissioner Anita Gradin and the European Parliament and it is a perfect example of how, with huge personal commitment on the part of everyone involved in the programme and in implementing the project and clear political will, results can be achieved and new policies developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Because violence is such a massive phenomenon, it has been hard to narrow the Daphne programme down. This is a taboo subject in the twilight zone. There is a lack of unequivocal data. But we know from studies that every third woman has experience of some form of gender-related violence. One in five women suffers violence at the hands of their spouse or partner. According to IOM estimates, 500 000 people are caught up in trafficking in the European Union every year, mainly women and children, while other women are at risk of genital mutilation.</p>
<p class="contents">We were only able to support 73 projects under Daphne in 2000 and 2001, just 12% of the projects proposed, causing some frustration among NGOs. Four million euros a year – hardly enough to move mountains – but enough to raise expectations and then dash them. But what is important is that Daphne was a multi-disciplinary tool and the Commission should continue to demonstrate flexibility here.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the violence monitoring centre in Dublin overseen by the European women's lobby provides excellent data. It also has managed to draft a good overview of the measures introduced and the legal instruments in the Member States. It brings synergies between players and projects at national, European and international level together. Unfortunately, the central and eastern European countries are still not involved enough. Only 6% of organisations even have any resources to put into projects. We found out during our delegations' trips to the candidate countries that there is a tremendous need here; they are hugely willing but financially unable and these two factors need to be reconciled in the NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important not to stop at the external borders of the European Union. Russia, the Ukraine, Belorussia, nowhere is safe from this phenomenon, which also affects us here in the European Union. We need to open up more and include other Community programmes in the Daphne programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I and my group think it is important that we build on our experience from the first half of the programme to strengthen synergies in the second half of Daphne. This is stated in item 12 of the resolution. We must continue with the campaign against violence and with preventive measures. There are excellent examples of this on the external borders in the form of warnings to young women. We have achieved good results with our networks, with the NGOs, and these now need to be implemented in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need – and this has been pointed out and called for on several occasions – is a European Year against Violence. Commissioner Reding, who is responsible for communications, has already given the go-ahead. Now we must push in the Convention for a clear statement to the effect that, from the point of view of the legal basis, this is not just a public health issue; internal security is also at risk if violence against women continues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially domestic violence, one of the most common forms of violence, although one of the least visible, and which involves huge human, social and economic costs for all of society, in addition to being a threat to the safety, the physical integrity, the freedom and the dignity of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of an integrated approach enhancing the measures, actions and financial means which the Daphne programme provides for, but which are insufficient, as has also already been emphasised. Furthermore, as the report states – and I must congratulate the rapporteur – in the European Union around 500 000 people per year, the majority of whom are women and children, are victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which also requires more effective measures in the fight against all forms of violence and in supporting victims, including increasing the financial means that are currently earmarked for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention, however, to the field of prevention, by creating more high-quality employment, better social provision and support and by paying greater attention to education against violence, by providing more information and improving promotion of women and children’s rights. I therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take account of the proposals put forward by Parliament, capitalising on the experience gained since 1997 and presenting a new action programme with appropriate financial appropriations, and also counting on the full participation of the candidate countries and the creation of a common database to eliminate violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are no contradictions in this report and in this revision of the Daphne programme. Everyone is in agreement. This initiative, instigated by the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has been a great success. Not only in Europe but also in many distant regions of the world, as my fellow MEPs have already mentioned. Sadly, it cannot be regarded as an unqualified success, as the Commissioner has already indicated. This programme may be drawing to a close, but I have heard many positive indications that it could continue although there may not be sufficient funds in view of all the associated problems.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the questions I should now like to raise is whether, in the case where certain projects have been approved by the Commission but cannot be funded, the Commission and your Commissioner could not recommend that the Member States, who are after all responsible for the projects, should take over a project. This would mean that a project would be funded by a Member State instead of the Commission, encouraging the Member States to undertake high-profile activities in their own country, perhaps also involving NGOs and public bodies such as local councils.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has selected violence against women as one of its priorities. This led to a major study into the measures taken by various Member States and an examination of best practice<span class="italic">. </span>The Danish Presidency continued along this path, but I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to one particular aspect which I think deserves more funding: violence within the family. Why? A survey conducted among the Antwerp police showed that 70% of all police work related to events directly connected with violence within the family. This includes incest, attacks by children on their parents and vice versa. Violence against elderly relatives, psychological problems, physical and mental violence before and after divorce, when exercising visiting rights or in the case of a newly formed family unit. I am not just talking about children who grow up in a violent family and so see this behaviour as normal, but also of a general blurring of moral standards. Sometimes the reverse occurs: one of the parents grew up in a disruptive or violent family and wants to spare their children this experience at whatever cost. This parent becomes over-protective and exerts too much discipline. The other family members either accept this situation or feel oppressed and rebel. In situations like this children may run away from home or attack their parents. Or girls growing up in circumstances like this later on unconsciously choose a tyrannical partner and often become the victim of domestic violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Making all these problems a fit topic for discussion in our society opened up a Pandora's box. We cannot abandon the victims to their fate, failing to provide support or a way out. I'm thinking here not just of the traditional activities like helplines, reception centres and safe houses, but also of training projects. Training and educational projects for people when they first come into contact with a possible victim and have the opportunity to help him or her out of their isolation: groups like doctors, teachers and police officers. Because acting when violence first occurs also prevents escalation and is the most important step in prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress just how important Daphne is. It was a project undertaken by a number of NGOs in various countries together with an international organisation: the International Organisation for Migration. They devised a project in the context of cooperation in helping the victims of human trafficking. That project was very successful, which is why I see it as so important that the projects can be continued and further refined. In fact, on 17 October the European Parliament will be holding a round table presenting a video, a brochure and a website where politicians like ourselves, police officers, journalists, researchers and students can obtain information. I should just like to tell my colleagues how important this is. Mrs Avilés Perea expressed it very well. We need the International Year against Violence, and subsidies. Perhaps we should put more pressure on our Member States to get involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most recent data on domestic violence and violence within the home, which reveal how one in five women is the victim of violent acts committed by her husband or partner, are incredible. These acts of violence are often never exposed and sometimes even end in the murder of the victim.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of such tragic figures, we are astounded at the allocation of such an inadequate sum, even taking into account the increase of the 2002 budget by EUR 1 million. We are also astounded that public bodies have only accounted for 10% of the participants.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of public bodies is, indeed, decisive, both in terms of training specialised staff and in terms of the provision of information on and prevention of acts of violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children. In particular, we need to create or improve counselling and legal advice centres which will be able to guarantee and provide maximum protection for the victims, as well as free psychological and legal assistance. It would be desirable to include teaching spaces dedicated to the prevention of child abuse and domestic violence in school curricula.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my group fully supports the idea of a European year of action to combat violence against women and children. However, I agree with my colleagues: if the legal basis is not changed, there is little of actual practical, effective use we can do to combat these terrible offences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, in recent years, during this legislature and during previous ones, a European awareness is being created of the problems of violence against women, against children and in the home. I believe we should insist on this working approach despite the fact that it is difficult to introduce the credibility and importance of these ideas into the policies of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider what is happening in many European countries. Organised prostitution, domestic violence, the alarming increase in violence against children and the abandonment of many of them by their families, demonstrate that we are talking about an issue which must be dealt with through a system of shared competences. In this regard, I fully support the proposals of Mrs Avilés and I very much agree with what the Commissioner has said.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it another way, Europe must create a minimum referential legal framework both for violence in the home and the obligation of the States to protect the victims and for trying to prevent the irreversible damage being done to children who are witnesses to horrors, minors who live in an atmosphere of fear and who cannot escape violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is very clear, and I would like to stress this, that the majority of abandoned children and those who suffer horrors in their own homes are in this situation because the family has broken down or has never existed. Consequently, their protection and education cannot be dealt with within the family framework. Other protection and defence strategies must be put in place since sometimes the family is a repressive environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have the feeling that we are getting used to so many cases arising. In this regard, I would ask for the implementation of a right for children which is binding for the Member States and that this obligation be taken into account when discussing the countries which are to join the European Union. It is impossible to carry on working without a basic legal framework, particularly when we know we are not protecting the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Horrendous reports from the numerous fronts in this absurd and merciless war reach our ears daily, especially from countries with which the European Union has concluded political and economic agreements, from Nigeria and Sudan, where fanatical Islamic courts condemn innocent women to death by stoning, from India, where little girls just ten years old are forced to marry, and from the Arab Emirates, where women still have no independence, i.e. political rights. Reports of this savage war against women appear in the press daily, even if they do not make the front page.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, as members have already said, it is estimated that over 500 000 women and children are bought and sold every day and yet Europol only has three officers working on this international organised crime against women and children. A percentage of European women which, depending on the country, varies from 20 to 50%, has fallen victim to domestic violence, while rape and sexual harassment are a daily occurrence. Communities of Islamic immigrants quote holy scripture and religious mores as an excuse for continuing their barbaric practices, such as the sexual mutilation of women, even inside the European Union. Unfortunately, in the year 2002, millions of women in numerous areas and communities around the world are still treated as chattels rather than human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee considers violence against women to be a very serious violation of the human rights of half of mankind, a modern form of barbarism tolerated by patriarchal societies and institutions alike. As the fight for sexual equality and <span class="italic">de facto </span>recognition of the rights of half the population on planet Earth steps up, so does violence against women. This means that violence is a global political problem of the first degree and must be tackled as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from its financial dimension – it must be said that the money is minimal compared with the size of the problem – the DAPHNE programme is of great political value, which is why it must continue beyond 2003, hopefully with a larger budget. We trust the new Treaty will give a stronger legal basis to the fight against violence. Our rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, has drafted a very valuable report and has tabled proposals on behalf of our committee which I ask you, Commissioner, to take on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are extremely close to achieving this approval and I hope that it will be formalised during this presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The only substantial answer that I should like to give at the moment concerns funding. I believe that it is sometimes tempting to think that, when an activity is eligible for Community funding, Community monies can be a replacement for national funding. In reality, however, the rules of our conception state that Community funding is additional to national funding in a task of this scale and of this political importance. Hence the importance that the Commission attaches to the public authorities of the Member States also being able to apply for the Daphne programme, because this would create a situation that encourages the Member States themselves to participate in projects and to invest financial means in combating violence against women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one problem, however, that I do not wish to ignore: the issue of the debate on funding is very closely related to that of the legal base. A clear, explicit and solid legal base in the Treaty would provide another lever for the funding of a project of this nature. As long as we have to work within the scope of Article 152 we shall continue to have problems. I sincerely hope that, with this debate, we might reach agreement on the joint efforts to be developed in the Convention so that the future Constitutional Treaty of the European Union enshrines the fight against violence towards women and children as an objective of the Treaty on European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
