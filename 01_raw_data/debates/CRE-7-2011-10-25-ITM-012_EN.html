<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – Dear colleagues, I have spoken to both Presidents, Van Rompuy and Barroso, today, telling them that I will inform them of the outcome of our debate in plenary. On Sunday, in the opening speech at the European Council, I argued that a decisive and comprehensive package needs to be defined to overcome the eurozone crisis, and that all EU institutions must come together. I reminded the European Council that we are also the Parliament of the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I welcome that today, between the European summit on Sunday and tomorrow’s meeting, we are taking the time to debate the short-, medium- and long-term solutions which are on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion from attending the European Council is that there are three urgent topics left.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is lowering Greece’s debt burden, but we need to know how much, and in what way, private investors will be involved; certainly voluntary rescheduling.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point: recapitalisation of European banks. Crucial decisions were taken by the Ecofin for all 27 Member States, such as that capital adequacy requirements will go up to nine per cent. Details on how the money will be raised on the markets, through national budgets and through the EFSF, have still to be decided. I believe that Parliament should have a say on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Point number three, which is very urgent as well: the creation of a firewall around economies in difficulty. The European Council should decide tomorrow on strengthening the role of the EFSF by allowing it to leverage money through insurance mechanisms. There are two other proposals on how to strengthen the firewall: by creating a special purpose vehicle and by creating a trust fund with IMF involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">For the medium term, we need to give time for the strengthened Stability and Growth Pact or ‘six-pack’, the European Semester, the Euro Plus Pact, and all our incentives for growth to work. Some competences may be national competences, but most Member States agree that we need to coordinate much better at European level. The important question is: how do we move all these issues from an intergovernmental framework to the Community method? It is clear that short- and medium-term solutions should be anchored in the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the longer term, there are discussions on a possible Treaty change. The question is: what kind of change do we expect? Are we ready to accept any changes?</p>
<p class="contents">In the long-term perspective, we need to draw conclusions from this crisis and reflect on the EU’s future. If we truly want a strong EU treated seriously by the global players, then this crisis gives us an opportunity to act quickly. The main conclusion is that we cannot afford the situation of a unity which is a kind of fragmentation in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We know this in theory. In practice, we talk about the EU, but we build our politics mostly on national levels. The Union is like a dream, whereas the nation state is current business. This European dualism is perceived from outside as our weakness and it is used against our common strategic European interest. Europe needs to be strong in a modern and multipolar world. Europe is not only a common market but a coherent, political concept – maybe even a power – able not only to overcome crises, but to have an impact on the modern world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corien Wortmann-Kool, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, do we really need a debate in this Chamber in Strasbourg at a time when the Heads of State or Government are doing everything in their power in Brussels, under the leadership of President Van Rompuy and the Commission, Commissioner Barroso, to take decisions tomorrow that are needed to pull Europe out of the crisis? A full radio silence has been agreed for this Sunday and the decisions will be announced only after tomorrow’s summit. What are we taking as the basis? Leaked draft documents, articles in the press?</p>
<p class="contents">However – and that is why we are participating in this debate – there is a lot of worry and a great sense of uncertainty amongst our citizens, because the crisis seems only to be deepening and the economic outlook worsening. Jobs for our citizens, our pensions, these important certainties are at risk. In this debate, I would therefore, on behalf of my group, encourage Heads of State or Government once again to take an ambitious approach. No partial decisions, but a comprehensive plan, a convincing approach, so that we can regain the trust of the financial markets and withstand attacks on our euro. We have got stuck for too long in political bickering and half-hearted solutions. That is why even the confidence that Europe is able to put things in order has been crumbling. We are now on the brink of ruin. There is no easy way out.</p>
<p class="contents">The origin of the debt crisis lies in Member States, but problems in some Member States are affecting us all. We share a common currency, from which we all benefit, year in year out. This also obliges us to work together in solidarity and to find solutions. Strengthening the EFSF and a European plan for capitalisation of the banks are essential for a lasting solution to the major problems in Greece and to restore peace to the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The EFSF should have the firepower of a bazooka and the borrowing capacity should be much, much higher, but the independence of the European Central Bank must be properly safeguarded, because if the markets are bluffing about the euro, then we, too, must be able to bluff. We must stand up for our prosperity, our security and stability. The situation is so serious that we need to be able to support even banks and countries with major liquidity problems from this fund under strict conditions, because the risk of infection is around the corner. We must literally prevent banks from collapsing, because a stable financial system is vital for economic stability and that is about our jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The banks and, where necessary, Member States are, first of all, responsible themselves for raising capital. The Emergency Fund should only be used when absolutely necessary. Likewise, recapitalisation should not constitute a reward for irresponsible policy. Instead, these two instruments must be properly linked to restructuring and a responsible remuneration policy, as also announced by the Commission. Banks need to be restored to lasting health, because for citizens, for our taxpayers, it is unacceptable that banks should be bailed out with taxpayers’ money again and again.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we, too, in this House, need to speed up regulation for financial markets and the proposals before us – the deposit guarantee scheme, a balanced financial transaction tax – so that they can work. In addition, we should, before long, put forward proposals for a banking crisis mechanism, linked to a levy on banks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the conclusions of last Sunday’s summit to accelerate the introduction of the ‘six-pack’. Moreover, a number of government leaders should take the responsibility to rapidly put their own houses in order. We must continue our efforts, especially in the euro area. It is also essential that we take important steps to that end in Eurotop’s conclusions tomorrow. The Euro Plus Pact must be enforceable and the Commission’s proposals, which should be implementable in Member States’ budgets, must be swiftly put into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should also have a fundamental debate about continuing economic and fiscal integration in the euro area and Europe as a whole, about our internal market. That debate also needs to address the issue of a change to the Treaties, but it is important that we have this debate with our citizens because public support for the European project is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that the European Council meeting on Wednesday may have genuinely earned the designation ‘historic’. This term is overused, but it could be that what is being decided tomorrow in Brussels will really be of historic importance, because a decision may be made tomorrow on the question of where Europe is going.</p>
<p class="contents">I have frequently been critical of the fact that the European Union has disintegrated into three parts: the German-French decision makers, the rest of the euro area and the remainder of the European Union, with a special position for the United Kingdom. This approach, this breaking down of Europe into different decision-making structures, is, in itself, one of the greatest risks that we face. It will destroy the community method and will ultimately create a situation in which the individual players, in particular, those in the euro area, will become so dramatically dependent on the domestic political situation in their countries that every person sitting around the table will be focusing only on his or her own national position, instead of basing their actions on community spirit and common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what has happened in Slovakia and it is now happening in Germany and in every other Member State, because the European Council and the council of 17 euro area countries are governed by the principle of unanimity. We are ultimately making one of the strongest currencies in the world dependent on the tactical domestic policy games of the Member States. We must put an end to this. Therefore, in future, we need community institutions which have the job of implementing community economic and monetary policy. We do not need any additional invented institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on a dangerous path, because we are putting confidence at risk: the confidence of the markets in the sustainability of investments in Europe and the confidence of citizens in the ability of their governments to effectively manage the euro area and the European Union as a whole. This confidence has been put at risk over the last 18 months. The process in the European Council of Heads of State or Government is generally as follows: announced, not implemented, withdrawn, looked at from different perspectives, announced again, not implemented again. Last weekend, we had the meeting between Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, but only now do we have the breakthrough. Now they have come to an agreement. In other words, they have announced something, but not implemented it.</p>
<p class="contents">On Sunday, in the middle of the debate, Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy held a press conference? What did it concern? The subjects that they had not agreed on. Yet it is obvious to everyone what all of this is about. We need to make this quite clear. It is about the size of the haircut, which depends on the extent to which the French banks will find themselves in the front line. They are the ones which are hardest hit and, therefore, the French state knows that when it comes to a haircut, these banks will have to be stabilised in one way or another. You have referred to this. The French state cannot do this from its national budget, because otherwise, it will put its rating at risk. Therefore, it is on the lookout for other forms of finance and aims to make use of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). There are two models: the German insurance model and the French banking model. They do not agree on this. How would it be if tomorrow, instead of constantly issuing unsettling interim reports, they were to sit down together, negotiate until white smoke could be seen and only then appear in public? They would be doing for the first time what needs to be done: winning back confidence in Europe, the confidence of the citizens and of the investors.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about possible amendments to the Treaty. I have read and heard that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is to be amended and that a working group has been set up involving Mr Van Rompuy, who, by the way, has missed a big opportunity here today. If he had come here, the attention of the whole of Europe would have been focused on him. All the Heads of Government are going to their parliaments and Mr Van Rompuy has missed his chance today. Other members of this working group include Mr Barroso and Mr Juncker, the president of the Eurogroup. Where does the European Parliament come in?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say at least on behalf of my group to those people who want to amend the Treaty that whatever sort of Treaty we have in Europe in future, even if it goes so far as to grant the right of intervention in national budgetary sovereignty, it will not happen without the European Parliament. We cannot allow the euro crisis to be used to continue the creeping deparliamentarisation of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My group will strongly oppose this. I hope that the decision that is made tomorrow is at last the decision that we need. Ultimately, it is no longer really about the content. It is about the Heads of State or Government demonstrating that they really are able to meet the challenge which is facing them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can tell you that on Thursday, I will make a proposal at the Conference of Presidents to summon Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso and Mr Juncker to talk about economic governance in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">They were appointed by the Council to make proposals for the December summit. I believe it is in all our interests to organise a debate with them, in Strasbourg, in November, on the content of their project. It should not be like last time, when we were convened at the end only to be confronted with a proposal that had already been decided on by the European Council without Parliament having been able to exercise any influence whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">I am telling you this now and I hope, I think, that we will, in any case, have the support of almost all the groups for this debate, in November, at the European Parliament. As for Wednesday’s summit, I get the feeling that after 20 months of hesitations, contradictions and half measures, the Heads of State or Government have realised that radical measures need to be taken. We need a global plan to truly restore stability in the euro area, as well as a kind of road map to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the content of this plan, Mr President, I believe that it is very simple. Eight days ago, in this House, we approved a resolution by an overwhelming majority. This covers the principal seven steps that need to be taken in this plan to restore stability in the euro area. No new approach is needed. No discussions are needed. We have decided on a clear and unambiguous resolution on the seven major reforms to be carried out in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume, Mr President, that you will go to Brussels on Wednesday to deliver your traditional introduction to the European summit, and I call on you to reiterate these seven points that the European Parliament is calling for to stabilise the euro area, in other words, to find a lasting solution for Greece. We need a European plan to recapitalise the banks, because it cannot be done with national measures. We must boost the bailout fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest with each other: among the other items in our resolution, there is one that will be crucial in the days and weeks ahead. We can talk about anything and everything – economic governance, economic government, the fiscal and economic union that we need, recapitalising the banks – they are all very important and therefore need to be repeated on Wednesday to the Heads of State or Government. However, we all know what the bottom line is: we need to find a way of boosting the bailout fund. That is what Wednesday will be all about, nothing else. As for the rest, they are going to say: ‘We will make some progress ahead of the December summit’. The bottom line, however, is this: how are we going to boost the bailout fund?</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Wortmann-Kool spoke about a bazooka. Will the bazooka be there? When they talk about financial markets, they only mean light weapons. When we talk about financial markets, we are talking about heavy artillery. Well, let me tell you that the proposal that will be approved on Wednesday already exists. Talk of boosting the bailout fund is already being heard in the corridors, not of the European Parliament, but of the Reichstag! That is where word is being spread about the proposal to be approved on Wednesday. I have it here. It is entitled ‘Draft terms and conditions maximising the lending capacity of the EFSF’. There are three and a half pages outlining all the details for achieving this. We are not the ones in possession of this document. It is being discussed at national level, not at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that it is a complicated system. You need to read this document at least three or four times before you understand it, and I have some doubts, Mr President, as to whether this system can work. In fact, it is a system whereby all debt securities issued by countries in difficulty will be underwritten by 20% – as already mentioned in the press. It does not matter whether those securities are issued by Spain, Italy or any other country; 20% will be underwritten. If the firepower of the bailout fund cannot be boosted, if the Member States do not reach an agreement on the European Central Bank’s involvement, and if a single bond market is not immediately introduced, what else can be done? We go back to national solutions. We are being told that the States must continue to issue bonds and that we Europeans will underwrite them by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that I have my doubts about the success of this system. 20%! We are going to grant Greece a 60% discount while, at the same time, hoping that a 20% guarantee will calm the markets. Once again, I hope that it will work, but I have my doubts, as I think that the only real solution for saving the euro that will work and which should be implemented as soon as possible is the creation of a single euro bond market, in the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that, in recent days and weeks, it has seemed to me that we are in the Europe of the 19th century rather than the 21st century. I have the feeling that we are in the Europe of sometime around 1815, after the Congress of Vienna, when people talked of a ‘concert of the great powers’, because, despite all the talk about European unity, European solutions and a community method, and the fact that we need to promote supranational solutions above the level of national solutions, in the past 14 days, I have seen only two national leaders running the whole show and taking decisions here. One of these was a Chancellor and one a President, who even berated another premier. They recommended that he keep quiet. I am no federalist, and Mr Schuman and Mr Monet are not great favourites of mine, but I would say that this does not sound very European and both gentlemen are perhaps turning in their graves.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the crisis itself, it is still the same story, and it is simply a situation in which we are making taxpayers pick up the bill for irresponsible behaviour. The irresponsible behaviour of banks and financial institutions, which acted as if they were in a casino, the irresponsible behaviour of states that bought off voters by throwing around public money which, in reality, they did not have, and we are proposing to ‘Europeanise’ the resulting debts, transfer them to everyone, and redeem them in the name of saving the euro, but it makes no difference what we call it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling that no one here reads the papers, and no one reads the economic editorials, because no decision will be taken tomorrow. Tomorrow, the EU will only buy time for one year, for two years, perhaps for three years, but afterwards we will be in the same situation again. Let us be aware, let us admit – many of you here admit it in the corridors but lack the courage to say it openly – that the euro is not a project for all, that a situation will inevitably come about where not all of the current euro area members will be able to continue in the project, because they will have to undergo a controlled bankruptcy, and they will have to undergo devaluation. You know it and you talk about it in the corridors, but you are unfortunately afraid to say it aloud. So tomorrow we will just be buying time. This is the most traditional approach, perhaps the most comfortable, the most costly, and the least credible one for the markets, and it is not statesmanlike. A statesman can be distinguished from a politician by the fact that he has the courage to adopt non-traditional solutions and knows how to make people believe in them, and knows how to carry them through. Tomorrow, therefore, we will learn, among other things, whether there really is a statesman in Europe, or whether we have mere politicians here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it became clear that everything that had been decided about Greece was incorrect and that everything which could have been done wrongly was done wrongly, and thanks to the report from the troika, this was also made clear to the Council. As long ago as July, the Council proposed a haircut for Greece which was criticised then for being too small. The funding for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was also too low in July. The unilateral insistence on austerity measures in Greece has ended in exactly the disaster that was predicted. The measures decided on in Brussels have exacerbated the crisis in Greece, both the Greek crisis and therefore the European crisis, from summit to summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The second insight which emerged from the weekend and from the repeated postponement is that it is not possible to manage a crisis in Europe by means of crisis summits. The very point which we have repeatedly reminded everyone about, in other words, that we need a different form of economic policy and stabilisation management, has once again been demonstrated by the way in which the Heads of State or Government went their separate ways after three days of intensive preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is calling for different results from the new summit. Tomorrow night, we would like to see an end to the repeated pattern of crisis summits where too few decisions are made too slowly and too inconsistently. We believe that the Greek haircut should be well over 50%. In addition, we must ensure that the speculators who have consistently been speculating on the bankruptcy of Greece on the basis of what amounts to a state guarantee do not once again earn billions of euro in profit overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also want to see a different signal being sent to Greece. The Greek economy has once again crashed as a result of our measures. We need a convincing plan for the reconstruction of the Greek economy. In the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the clear focus should be on sustainability, in the light of the EU 2020 decisions. I know that we cannot decide on the details, but we need to start working on a credible plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on the EFSF – I do not like the stupid term ‘bazooka’ – must be made in such a way that the funding can be increased. Anyone who talks about solidarity must once again ensure at this point that the financial engineering measures which we are planning to employ do not make the public budgets unmanageable or impose too heavy a burden on them. We need to find a happy medium in this case, too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recapitalisation of the banks, on the basis of our current knowledge, it is clear that this is once again happening too slowly. The process of nationalising responsibility for this guarantees that Dexia will not be a one-off case, but will be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have seen how Europe cannot be led out of the crisis. I believe strongly that we should now discuss in detail amendments to the Treaty and that we should also establish a convention which allows the citizens of Europe to understand what types of amendments are being made. However, in the light of the increasing divide between the European economies and of the major and acute problems we are facing, I believe that we should now take another bold step. We must enhance the status of the Commissioner responsible for financial programming and budgets in the Commission in Brussels. We must empower him to promote sound, viable budgets based on the principle of solidarity and also to encourage economic policy development. Anyone who does not dare to do this is not brave enough to lead the EU out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express one final wish based on the example of Germany which relates to many Europeans. Anyone who is afraid of their voters cannot overcome the European crisis. We are having to remind Ms Merkel about Helmut Kohl and Helmut Schmidt and we are having to remind Mr Westerwelle about Joschka Fischer. Anyone who recognises that something is the right thing to do must take action and must justify their actions to their voters. Then they may be able to win elections, but without this courage they will lose at home and may also lose the European Union.</p>

The Council is starting to introduce pre-summits and main summits within the space of three days. Parliament is following the same rhythm and debating the results of the Council discussions twice during one part-session. It is already becoming clear that the big step forward that has been promised will not be happening on this occasion either. The only thing left to say is that the Council and the Commission are continuing to work on the principle of hope: hope that the new measures will generate sufficient confidence and that the investors on the international financial markets will be satisfied this time around.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should they stop betting on future state bankruptcies? Why should they not try to draw Spain and Italy into the maelstrom of speculation? Only radical measures to prevent profitable speculation can stop this from happening. Until we bring in measures of this kind, the carousel will continue to turn and the Council will continue to propose rescue packages based on taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion now is to use financial engineering tricks to leverage the agreed funding of EUR 87 billion for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). One German economist has referred in this context to a weapon of mass destruction, because the states which are showing signs of weakness require financing to the tune of EUR 4 trillion. The proposed haircut for Greece is inevitable. The only question is: who will bear the cost of it? Of course, it is right that the international banks should take on a greater share of up to 60%. However, it is important for us to prevent bankruptcies. This affects Greek banks in particular, whose very existence is under threat. After all the cuts in social security spending, do the Greek citizens now have to worry about the safety of their savings and bank deposits?</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of a rescue package for the banks, we need a rescue package for wages, salaries, pensions and citizens’ savings. We need a public bank in the European Union which provides states with the necessary loans at favourable interest rates and excludes the private banks. We need public investment programmes to create jobs and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also shows the growing gap between the voting citizens and the institutions – including the European Parliament – that are supposed to represent them and which, instead, often take decisions that are distant and not what people want.</p>

In contrast, Europe’s Heads of State or Government once again failed last weekend to agree on concrete measures to bring an end to the ongoing crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual problem in Europe is the lack of united and decisive political leadership. Why is the Council continuing to discuss the involvement of the private sector when the private sector is already starting to take independent action? This means primarily that the political leadership of Europe is lagging behind the real world. Following the reports from the troika on Greece last week, the question of whether a haircut will ultimately be enough is already being asked. This is another consequence of the delays in European policy making.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am calling urgently on all the stakeholders to take immediate, decisive and united action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
