I am very happy to be here today to introduce to you a new team of European Commissioners. In the last two addresses I gave before the European Parliament, in April and May, I promised to inaugurate a new era of change within the Commission. The new College of Commissioners which I am going to introduce to you today is the team which will implement these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to introduce each member of the College to you individually. They are sitting here in front of you and their names are well known to you. This is a well-balanced team of the highest quality, and is the result of my constructive debates with the Heads of State and Government, which have fully respected the new powers which the Treaty of Amsterdam conferred on the President-elect.</p>
<p class="contents">Each member of the team has proven experience. Almost all have been members of the parliaments of their own countries, three quarters of them have been Ministers, many have been leaders of political parties and others have accumulated a wealth of experience in diplomacy, business, economic policy making and the legal sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Right from the beginning, I have made no bones about the fact that I would not accept a lower female representation than that of the outgoing Commission. I have succeeded in this although I had hoped to do better. Therefore, throughout its term of office, the Commission will promote equality of opportunities between the sexes in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The new College is also characterised by the right balance between the political complexity of national governments and the European Parliament. I am happy that this is so, but it should be specified that the Commission does not operate according to the same procedures as political parties. The Commission is a College and the Commissioners are neither delegates from political groups nor representatives of their national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">In our first informal meeting last weekend, we set a few clear ground rules. Each Commissioner will, at all times, discharge his duties in such a way as to reflect the interest of Europe as a whole. If at any point I am not satisfied with the situation, I will not hesitate to use the powers conferred on me by the Treaty and change competences and portfolios or ask individual Commissioners to resign. With regard to this, although it is not laid down by the Treaty, each Commissioner has given me his personal assurance that he will stand down if and when I ask him to. Obviously, this is not a step to be taken lightly, but the existence of these agreements is a transparent guarantee of the sense of responsibility of each individual Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We also found we were in agreement regarding the need for the new College to abide by the highest standards of public life. One of the first actions of the new Commission will therefore be to adopt formally the new Code of Conduct for Commissioners, including also new, stringent rules for avoiding conflicts of interest when the Commissioners leave their office.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to getting down to work and we hope that dialogue with the Parliament will be frank and open during our team"s hearings, and that we will receive firm support from you in September.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to the other main subject of my address today: the reform of the Commission. The need for reform is indisputable, as recent events have shown that European institutions as a whole are no longer adequately equipped to deal with the wide range of tasks incumbent upon them. This is why I have promised a revolution in the Commission"s operating procedures. This does not mean that I want to undermine the Commission"s achievement as an institution: that would be extremely unjust. The Commission has many strong points, including committed, experienced personnel and a great capacity for innovation and foresight. Over the years, it has given proof of its considerable capacities to adapt, repeatedly taking on new tasks and responsibilities. Practically every major development in the process of European integration can be traced back to the commitment and dedication of the personnel in the Commission. However, as is the case in numerous public administrations, the world has moved on and the Commission has failed to keep up. Too little has been done to modernise the institution itself and no alterations of substance have been made to the structure of the Commission in forty years. This is why an in-depth examination of the institution"s working procedures needs to be carried out now.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge to be taken up consists of redesigning, adapting and improving the organisation in order to make it more efficient, to fight fraud at all levels and place the institution at the service of the citizens of Europe. Let us not be under any illusions! This whole process of change will take time, but an initial reorganisation of the Commission is already underway. The bureaucratic machine will be simplified and rationalised, with fewer Directorates-General. The Commissioner"s offices, that is, their private offices, will be in the same building as their respective Directorates-General. Both offices and Commissioners will be more streamlined and more multinational – I have tried to ensure that each head or second in command of an office is the citizen of a different country from that of the Commissioner, and each office contains people from at least three different Member States. The rules for appointing higher civil servants will be more stringent and transparent, and mobility within the Commission of higher civil servants will increase. The Directorates of the Commission will be identified by short, clear names instead of by numbers, and a larger department will be established in the mass media and communications sector to ensure that the Commission"s policies are communicated professionally and that they reach all the citizens of Europe. Naturally, this is only the beginning and further, more important changes will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Presumably, the Committee of Independent Experts will present its second report in September, although I share Mrs Fontaine"s hope that it will be ready for publication as soon as possible, within a time frame which the five wise men will be able to sustain. We will study this report with the utmost attention, and I hope that it will contain elements which will be useful for the reform process. In this respect, the new Vice-President responsible for reform will submit a detailed plan at the beginning of the year 2000. All this will have to be discussed in depth with the European Parliament. In particular, we will have to find a suitable mechanism for ensuring that the Parliament is kept constantly and exhaustively informed of the progress of the reform, while at the same time respecting the Commission"s autonomy in managing its own competences. My intention is to transform the Commission into a world class administration which will lead by example. Our watchwords at all times will be transparency, accountability and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is not the time to dwell on the programme for the new Commission. I gave a broad overview of our future priorities in my addresses to this Parliament in April and May, and we will have the opportunity to examine these issues in more detail in September. I am here today to introduce the new Commission, not its programme, but I can promise you that the central theme of our entire programme will be to make the European Union more relevant to the citizens of Europe. In fact, it cannot be denied that the European institutions are suffering from a collective loss of confidence on the part of our citizen and in order to win this back, we must act decisively. However, we will only succeed if we confront the issues which have genuine importance in the daily life of the citizens, such as unemployment, economic growth and the challenge represented by sustainable development to ensure a balance between the creation of riches, social justice and quality of life. This must be the new Commission"s genuine priority.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have just said, this is not the time for a detailed examination of the programme, but I would like to put forward just three examples of what I mean by renewal. First of all, let us consider the issue of health and food safety. The European public has lost confidence in the national and European authorities responsible for controlling drugs and foodstuffs: it no longer has faith in this government, or any other governments, or scientists. I consider it our duty to take the initiative and make provision for an independent European Food and Drugs Agency, which will help to win back consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Air traffic is another matter for concern. Our European airports are in a semi-permanent state of chaos, due to ever-increasing traffic and lack of co-ordination between air traffic controllers. I think we can all testify to this. The problem transcends national boundaries in this case as well, and we must seek solutions at a European level – solutions that really work.</p>
<p class="contents">A third example is the doping which is taking place in the sporting world – a question which may seem banal to some but which for many is a cause of deep concern. This is a problem which obviously requires the different nations to co-ordinate and take decisive action. I do not pretend that Europe has all the answers to these problems. What I mean is that we must show our commitment to contributing to the resolution of these issues at a European level, as by their very nature, they go well beyond purely national boundaries. I have no hesitation in suggesting that in some cases – or, rather, in many cases – the answer to the concerns of disillusioned European citizens lies not in reducing but in increasing the European dimension. The vast majority of European citizens are not sceptical about action on a European scale, but they are becoming increasingly disillusioned and are fast losing interest in the interminable, impenetrable wrangles over who should do what at a European level. What the citizens persist in demanding are clear answers to the important problems in their everyday lives. The bottom line is, what interests them is not who solves their problems but the fact that the problems are finally being dealt with. They want consumers to be able to trust the food they buy, travellers to be able to take a plane without worrying about their safety and the sporting world to be above board.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already stated that I do not intend to dwell on the policies as the time for that will be in September. However, I would like to touch briefly on two issues which are especially important in the new Commission: Kosovo and the next Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us first take the situation in Kosovo and the Balkans. The war in the Balkans has left the whole of Europe deeply scarred. What we must do now is make sure that peace brings something positive. As time goes on, my concern grows that our capacity to make war far exceeds our ability to co-ordinate the reconstruction after the devastation suffered by the populations involved. More time than necessary has been wasted in diplomatic disputes over who should co-ordinate the reconstruction work. It is now a question of focusing our energy on the really important tasks: rebuilding houses left without roofs, putting back together shattered communities, and, even more importantly, providing the Balkans with a clear political and economic future, which will put an end to all the centuries of continual conflict. Only the European Union can do this. In order to restore peace, a clear, long-term strategy is needed, based on reconstruction, reconciliation and <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> : construction to repair the damage done by the war, reconciliation between all the parties involved, including the Serbian people, and the <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> of this region to the European Union, including the prospect of future accession to the European Union for all the countries of the region, if and when they show themselves to be politically and economically ready. I am sure that the best way of pursuing such a goal is the method already successfully employed by the Community in the past: firstly, to ask the various parties to co-operate with each other, to start to work together on issues of everyday relevance, to establish customs unions, to set up common institutions and to consolidate peace through common interests. This is how lasting peace was achieved within the European Union, reconciling opposed nations by co-operation. When the Second World War was still a recent event, the signatories to the Treaty of Rome were people of great courage and farsightedness. Are the men and women of our generation unable to display the same farsightedness and courage over the Balkans issue? Is it that Europe is not ready to take the risk? Does Europe not have the ambition to bring about successful change?</p>
<p class="contents">When we start to take up this challenge, we find before us a paradox. The European Union may be first in line with its contribution, but the risk is that the impact of its aid will be lost in a complicated network of competing structures: the United Nations Mission to Kosovo, the Stability Pact, the G−7 High Level Group for economic relations, the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia, the special envoy for the Republic of Yugoslavia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p class="contents">This multitude of decisions undermines the central function which should be carried out by the European Union. There is a desperate need to simplify things. In particular, we must ensure that the European Union"s huge financial contribution is spent on reconstruction and not on bureaucracy. I believe this is the reason the Commission has refused, for example, to draw upon the budget made available by the OBNOVA reconstruction programme, approximately EUR 45 million to pay the salaries of the seven hundred people working for the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia. This is the equivalent of a sum of about EUR 17 million out of a total of forty-five. As a priority, our financial aid must be used to benefit the population and reconstruction work directly. We must focus exclusively on sustaining the economic growth of the region and reinforcing its democratic structures. Moreover, with regard to the structures to be created, we must pay particular attention to the specific value added in each case. We must at all costs avoid things being done in Brussels when it would be better to do them in Thessaloniki, and doing things in Thessaloniki when it would make more sense to do them in Pristina.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I want to touch on today is the new Intergovernmental Conference which will be announced at the Summit in Helsinki. Some people think that the Intergovernmental Conference will be a simple job of fine-tuning after the Amsterdam Summit, the object of which will be to speed through the individual issues on which it was not possible to reach agreement in Amsterdam. I do not share this view. For me, the Intergovernmental Conference will be crucial for European institutions. It is our opportunity, possibly the last opportunity, to prepare ourselves for the potential doubling of the number of the Union"s Member Countries. In my opinion, an Intergovernmental Conference which only has limited goals could not deal with a similar challenge. I am well aware that some people will object that it is better to make rapid progress in a limited field than to line up a whole series of issues in several fields, which are too complex to be resolved quickly. To me, this means not going to the heart of the matter. If the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is too limited to allow us to prepare adequately for enlargement, the only thing to do is to enlarge its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">It will serve no purpose to patch up the borders. For enlargement to work, an in-depth, thorough examination of the institutions is essential. To this end, I intend to build a small, high level working party – and I do hope that it will be of a high level – which, during the next three months, will prepare a report on the subjects to be covered at the Intergovernmental Conference. The report will contribute to the preparation of the official position of the new Commission on the Intergovernmental Conference. Even though much of the political demand of the European Union is currently opposed to a clear refusal on this matter, I will not be shaken in my resolve to present, at least in an official way, the possible options.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it would be an error of mammoth proportions to organise an Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki which is too limited, simply because of the collective fear of confronting the real challenges of future enlargement head on. We will naturally see to it that the European Parliament plays a greater role in the work carried out in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the institutions of the Community have been through a very difficult period. The European public is now looking to us to draw a line under the past and move on towards the future. The challenge facing all of us is that of restoring the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens and ensuring that they understand the benefits that the European Union provides for their personal, everyday lives. I cannot insist enough on this point. As I speak, the whole of the European public is watching us, and is waiting with bated breath to see what is about to happen in the great history of the Commission and the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to propose that we disappoint those spectators who have come here to watch a confrontation. None of us will act in the interest of the people of Europe if we allow the European institutions to be in a state of permanent confrontation and deadlock. Now we have a new Parliament and a new Commission, and this is our opportunity to start afresh. The Commission and this Parliament are the only two institutions whose leaning is exclusively and genuinely towards Europe. There should be a solid alliance between them. We have to deal with the same tasks. Who else, if not the Commission and this Parliament working together, can take this project forwards? The Commission has suffered greatly from the recent events, but I believe that this Parliament has also been affected, considering the poor turn-out at the recent elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The task we face is that of restoring deep, mutual confidence between the two institutions, which has traditionally been the driving force of European integration. This means working together, while at the same time acknowledging the diversity of our functions. I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the Parliament for there to be a strong, autonomous, independent, trusted Commission. I hope that the new College which you see before you today will receive your full support in September. The go-ahead is not, however, a <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> for the future. This Parliament, which is the voice of the citizens of Europe, is the supreme judge of the Commission"s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with many challenges and Europe needs a powerful sign of renewal and leadership. I have done all I can to prepare the new team and we are all impatient to get started. However, only you can give us the signal to start work. I am confident that you will use the great powers and responsibilities conferred on you by the Treaties wisely and in the best interests of the Union.</p>

That is progress and we welcome it. Today"s debate is part of a longer process and the Hearings, which are to start on 30 August and run throughout the first week of September, also form part of this process. All those who say that they endorse the Commission or say ‘No’ to it today, be they within or outside this Parliament, are disregarding Parliament, because the Hearings are an important part of the whole process, at the end of which we will be free to reach a decision on whether or not we will endorse the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you said again just now that the Commission is balanced. I don"t know which criteria you would cite in support of its being balanced, but I want to make it crystal clear to you that we, the Group of the European People"s Party and European Democrats do not consider this Commission to be politically balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">(Loud applause) </p>
<p class="contents">And that is why we must not allow the myth to develop in Europe that this Commission is balanced. If you were to repeat that it is politically balanced then under no circumstances would you be increasing the likelihood of your team being endorsed, although it may well be thoroughly competent.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause, heckling) </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr President, I should be grateful if you could enlarge a little on the criteria used to judge balance. This team has a weak point. You said that you were wholly responsible for putting the new team together. I am bound to inform you that the preceding Council Presidency under the Federal Republic of Germany certainly did not speak in terms of a process in which you as President-designate of the European Commission were involved. What happened to you in Bonn was a diktat from the German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause, heckling) </p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty states: the governments of the Member States shall nominate the other individuals they intend to appoint in agreement with the President-designate. As far as we are aware, you had no involvement in the nomination of the two German Members of the Commission. I am bound to tell you that I find this regrettable. The vociferousness of your arguments does nothing to improve them, Mr Cohn-Bendit, neither does it improve the arguments of the others now kicking up a fuss behind me. We consider it unacceptable that whilst Great Britain, Italy, Spain and France nominate two Commissioners, one of them belonging to the Opposition, this example is not followed in the Federal Republic of Germany. I consider it unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">(Loud applause) </p>
<p class="contents">It shows presumptuousness and arrogance on the part of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Our President, whom we elected to Office yesterday, spoke of how important it is for us to receive the Report by the Wise Men as quickly as possible. It is my wish for us all that we should work together to see that this report by the Wise Men is made available before the Hearings begin.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">We, or at least my group, will also do all that is necessary to ensure that an adequate period of time is allowed for each applicant during the Hearings, for the one and a half hours which have been allowed for hitherto are not sufficient. We need at least three hours to hold a discussion which is to our complete satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">I would also recommend, Professor Prodi, that we, as a Parliament, are given the opportunity to enter into probing discussion with you in the appropriate committee. I speak on behalf of my group when I say that the Hearings are conducted on a fair basis and without any form of personal discrimination. This means that as far as the individuals are concerned, we treat everyone equally at the Hearings. There is no prejudice. We are fair and shall also behave accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause, heckling) </p>
<p class="contents">To close, a remark concerning the role of our institutions. Mr President, I support your contention that we the European Parliament and the Commission have equal responsibility for this European Union. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and you used the term ‘government’, a term I personally very much approve of, because it implies that this government must also bear parliamentary responsibility and be accountable to Parliament. That is why, Mr President of the Commission, I should be grateful if you would provide me with an answer to the following question. You have said that you have asked every Member of what is potentially your new Commission whether they would actually comply with your request in the event that you were to ask them to resign. That is why I want to ask you the following: if a Committee of Parliament was not to endorse an individual a majority, if the Committee was to say ‘no’, what then would be the question that you would put to your team? Would you then urge the Member to comply with the vote taken by this committee of the European Parliament? I would be pleased to hear you answer this question.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">A final remark: As the Group of the European People"s Party and European Democrats, we know that we have responsibility for Europe and when the Hearings have taken place we will make our own decision, remaining true to our consciences, and I hope it will be a decision that serves the interests of us all.</p>

<p class="contents">I think we should remember now that we are having this debate on this side of the Rhine and not on the other side. On the other side, there are domestic issues which can very well be resolved in Germany, but this is not the place to bring them up.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I hope we are capable of overcoming this first great crisis which is currently facing us in the European Union. According to the opinion polls, the citizens are still in favour of the European Union. However they do not participate in great numbers in the elections. We have the responsibility, as elected representatives, for construction rather than destruction. This means that we have to respond to the problems which are worrying our fellow citizens: unemployment, Kosovo, consumer problems, the management of the euro. This must be done as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We can neither carry on with a Commission in total ruin, nor delay its investiture until next year. How could we explain such a thing? Mr Prodi, you have spoken of the Commission as the government of Europe. I will offer you a more sporting simile: a team. We are playing here a European league. The German, Italian, Spanish and Danish leagues each play against each other in their own countries, but not here. Here we have to take the lead as Members of the European Union. I therefore believe that there is a basic truth in your talk of this team and this government. Your Commission must be invested in a democratic fashion. You have begun to take steps. You have announced reforms. I agree with you that it is impossible to make known the list of Directorates General, and I am grateful that the change is going ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot subordinate the work which must be done by the Commission – and I say this, Madam President, with all respect for what you have demonstrated this morning – to this report by the Committee of Experts. The report of the Committee of Experts is a useful instrument, not a basis for law. We must show political judgment and responsibility in order to understand what we can ask of the new Commission and in order to await and support the reform process proposed by President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to such a critical matter as the hearings – which for us are fundamental – we believe that these must be directed at Commissioners regardless of the political persuasion of the particular Commissioner. Questions should be asked of the Commissioners – first in writing and then orally – in order to discover whether they are in a position to fulfil their responsibilities and also to identify their political criteria with regard to Europe. This is absolutely legitimate, but we must not turn this into a sort of fairground shooting-gallery where we blast away and see how many candidate Commissioners remain standing. It seems to me that this would be enormously dangerous and, of course, my group intends to ask questions, responsibly and on our own terms – without waiting for third parties to tell us what to do – and we will ask them in a way which will deliver us, as soon as possible, a Commission which is in a position to carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President Prodi, we have listened attentively to what you have said in relation to the individual responsibility of the Commissioners. In politics, responsibilities may be accepted, above all, when they are taken up. But I believe that you have touched upon a constitutional matter which is tremendously important and the standards which can and should be adopted by the Parliament, which has already expressed its view on this question, must be taken into account. I think this should be discussed with a little more calm.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Union reform process – which is absolutely necessary, not only in terms of enlargement but also in terms of making the Union more democratic and efficient – Madam President, I believe that we cannot have another Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors. It should be done in the way that we carry out reforms in our own States: transparently and on record, in Parliament and before our co-citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">How can we explain that we have the euro – a common currency which is not common to all – but at the same time we are implementing reforms which not even we are able to comprehend or justify. In this respect, we believe this to be an absolutely critical matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we do not participate in the threats made by some political groups in this Parliament, who want to take the Commission, which presents itself to our scrutiny, hostage. We do not believe we should take it hostage. Our future is genuinely at stake with this Commission. Furthermore, we should remember that if we go along the route of concessions we will never know where we will end up and we must act responsibly. For some people, the principal objective is not to achieve institutional equilibrium but to undermine it and destroy it. We do not share that opinion; we believe that the European Union, our fellow citizens, deserve better, they deserve a Parliament which acts responsibly and with an approach which looks to the future, with hope and towards the construction of a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, may I conclude my intervention – if President Prodi will allow me – with a quote in my own language, written by an immortal Italian, by Manzoni, who says in <span class="italic">I promessi sposi</span> : ‘<span class="italic">Adelante, Romano, con juicio</span> ’ (“Go ahead, Romano, wisely’).</p>

<p class="contents">I want to make a few things clear here at the outset. Firstly, the ELDR Group in this House comes here in terms of a European vocation. We will not judge Commissioners on the basis of the national preferences of one or other party or group inside this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say, Madame President, in respect of your helpful suggestion this morning that we should incorporate, as we prepare for the hearings, an understanding of the work and insight of the Committee of Experts that we, as an Institution, must say to the Experts ‘speed up what you do and deliver it in time'. If necessary, 'speed up the report' but by no means should we slow down the process of hearings as anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">My group's essential and fundamental starting point in this debate is very clear. The outgoing Commission resigned last March and since I can hardly explain to myself why the rump part of that Commission is still there, how can we expect the citizens of Europe to understand that fact? It is therefore our overwhelming duty in this House to decouple Europe from this institutional embarrassment at the earliest available date and the only means to do that is to take the available Commission – and I do not prejudge how the hearings may go – and do our utmost to make sure that it takes up office at the earliest available date. By this means we should begin to decouple ourselves from what has been a very difficult, but useful experience, but one that remains, unfinished as it is, deeply embarrassing and complicated as we have seen recently by the deplorable choices of Dr Martin Bangemann.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I say also in regard to the hearings process which will be in two parts, i.e. written and oral, that we in the Liberal Group will want to know from each of the candidate Commissioners: ‘What is the perspective that you will bring to Europe for Europe?' This will be important to us. We want to be able to talk to you and engage with you on the question of suitability for the portfolios and to understand the capacities that you bring to this prospect. We want to ask you about your willingness, your personal willingness, to accept that you are accountable and responsible to the public of Europe in whatever you do with your President and before this House and in clear and full public understanding that this is the public forum for European democracy to which you are accountable and have a public responsibility. I wish to say on behalf of my group that when the IGC comes we will continue to press for Treaty reform on the question of individual accountability. We recognise that within the current constraints Professor Prodi is taking some steps to improve the dreadful situation of the past, but we may need Professor Prodi to take some more steps.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose that the hearings should be tough because we have learned from the lessons of the past five years that it is better to be tough at the outset than to regret it later. Our hearings also will be fair. There is one point I would ask the Commission President-designate to respond to. We have been so busy reconstituting ourselves we have not yet had the capacity to do our homework and our research, so if the hearings bring to light issues of substance and public concern about which we as yet know nothing, we in this House would have a duty to Europe to act and we will act – certainly, my group will.</p>
<p class="contents">If such difficulties present themselves, I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission, Professor Prodi, please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises. We need a respectful dialogue between our institutions. This Parliament has matured in recent months and we have learned one basic lesson for the years ahead: we are no longer the junior partner in the European political institutions. We do not claim the status of ‘primus inter pares' but we expect and demand to be treated as an equal among equals in the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in September we have the hearings and, as I said, I do not wish to anticipate how they should proceed, but my group's strong preference is that in September – subject always to the reservations that we must see what emerges – we should take a decision and rid ourselves of a sense of crisis. If we have to have some difficult debates, for God's sake, let us have them in September and let us have it out in September so that we do not have some form of institutional guerilla warfare right through to December or January. Let us do the business early and let us do the business well!</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment, Madam President; before he had this high office thrust on him some months ago, rather I think to his surprise, Mr Prodi had sought to contest the European elections in Italy. He had chosen as the symbol of his party the donkey. Well, the donkey has various traits – one of which we know is stubbornness. I wish to say to Professor Prodi, if he uses his stubbornness in this Parliament as a reliable partner for Europe, that is the kind of stubbornness we welcome. And if he uses his stubbornness to refuse to dialogue with us, if we have difficulties in the hearings, that is a stubbornness we will oppose.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the message of my group today. We want to work with you as a reliable partner for Europe now and in the future and that requires respectful dialogue. We will give it. We believe in a strong Europe, we believe in a strong Commission and we believe we should be natural allies – let us work to that end.</p>

Your team, Mr Prodi, faces a double challenge of which the first, which you have mentioned at length, is the restoration of the trust of the citizens and parliamentarians. The institution that you will be presiding over must achieve this trust. We can only have trust in an institution if it is run rigorously and transparently. I believe that you have the necessary qualities to restore that trust, and I have no reason, at first sight, to believe that the various applicant Commissioners are not also up to the job, whatever their political allegiance. I therefore greet your team positively. It goes without saying that we are impatiently awaiting the second report of the Wise Men, which is constantly being promised us, and your reaction to its contents, before expressing a definitive opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like straightaway to deal with the second challenge, which has already been widely discussed. In my opinion, this challenge which you are going to have to face is more political and just as fundamental. Certain recent events, such as the war in Kosovo and the new crisis in the field of food safety which has occurred in Belgium, but which clearly has repercussions for the whole of Europe, are particularly significant, and I believe that the necessary responses to them – and you have said some interesting things in this respect – must be ambitious responses.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also important deadlines and I think there is one deadline that nobody has mentioned until now and that is the opening of the new negotiations of the World Trade Organisation in Seattle at the end of this year. I believe that this is a major problem and when we talk of transparency we find ourselves faced with a significant problem. I do not wish to criticise you though, for ideas which you may not hold.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention the relationships, which have sometimes been difficult, between the Commission and the Parliament. It has often been said that there is a natural alliance between the Commission and the Parliament. In the past, the facts have unfortunately often shown that this alliance is more frequently evoked than realised. The rejection by the Commission of the Parliament"s position – even when passed with an overwhelming majority – does not show a good attitude and I would like to point out that it is the previous Commission which is responsible for it. Likewise, I could speak of the numerous resolutions voted for by the Parliament – with just as big a majority – involving requests for initiatives which have not been responded to or acted upon for years. We await from you, Mr President, a change of attitude in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Some moments ago, I mentioned the start of the new round of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation, and I would like to dedicate my remaining two minutes of speaking time to this subject. The Commission has obtained from the Council the mandate for negotiations proposed by the last Commission – in fact by Mr Leon Brittan. This mandate has not been debated by the European Parliament nor by national parliaments. There is, however, a fundamental problem which we find totally unacceptable; that is, the broadening of the competencies of the World Trade Organisation without a serious and exacting evaluation of its workings having been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">In fact the World Trade Organisation, as it currently functions, plays an extremely arguable role in European politics. In this respect, I could mention the decisions regarding the issue of bananas and that of hormones in cattle rearing.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of concrete measures aimed at respecting multi-national agreements on the environment – in particular on climate and biodiversity – and the implementation of the decisions of the Copenhagen Summit with regard to the fight against poverty, have been put on hold. Meanwhile, the Committees of the WTO are imposing their law on democracies – in particular the European Union – and are giving priority to free trade over all other issues, whether they concern public health, the environment, human rights or social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle, which forms the basis of European legislation relating to the environment, is, if not ignored, then interpreted in a very restrictive manner by that organisation. Your Commission, Mr President, must express its view on this subject in a clear and rapid manner, at least before the negotiations start.</p>
<p class="contents">We are ready to open a debate on this subject and I hope that this goes for the other political groups. It is even more important that the dioxin affair in Belgium, which will be the subject of heated debates, is clearly connected to the problem of food safety which is itself clearly directly related to the functioning of the World Trade Organisation. Transparency, Mr President, must not only be applied to management, including financial and administrative management, but also to political decisions. And on this point, it should be noted that there are serious deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore expect ambitious initiatives from you and your team. I hope you do not disappoint us and I insist once again that we are prepared to work loyally with you and to listen attentively to the arguments of the nominee Commissioners in the forthcoming hearings.</p>

We will carry out this assessment with great care and, naturally, try to be constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission has pointed out the need for a clear rapport between the composition of the Commission itself and its programme. We will assess the proposed choice on the basis of this rapport. At the moment, the composition appears to us to be rather neocentralist, and the representation of women still inadequate, but in any case, it is a question of assessing the overall success of the operations as they happen. The decisive factor will essentially be the relationship between the Commission and its programme, and we are preparing for this comparison with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission has touched on some of the issues such as public health, doping in the sporting world and air traffic, to give a token semblance of adherence to the programme, but his attention seems rather to me to be focused on two other issues: the reconstruction of Kosovo and the Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki. I would like to comment on these two issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to Kosovo, it is right to be thinking of reconstruction and reconciliation and treating the Balkans as a region with a special relationship with Europe. However, it is also essential to be aware, in addition to the damage in the Balkans, of the devastation wreaked by the war both on international order, with international legislation ripped to shreds and on the UN, which has been razed to the ground, and to bear in mind the substantial loss of autonomy for Europe with regard to the Atlantic Alliance and the United States of America. Now, of course we must reconstruct the Balkans, but in order to do so, Europe needs to regain its autonomy and authority, which requires democratic construction as well.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi is giving thought to the Intergovernmental Conference, but he seems not to be giving enough heed to the fact that the critical state of the institutions and the citizens" lack of confidence in them is neither politically nor socially neutral. Although it is exacerbated by the confidence crisis produced by the <span class="italic">défaillance</span> of the Commission, this Parliament does have a democratic deficit. It is far removed from the everyday problems of the people of Europe. The only Governmental body seems to be the Central European Bank, and that has less control than the United States" Central Bank. However, we await what will be said in the hearings with great interest and especially in the September programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like you to know, Mr President, that our attitude will nevertheless depend on the correction we request from you regarding the content of your previous speeches, which displayed a change of direction which we did not appreciate. It is not for me to remind you that there are twenty million unemployed in Europe at the moment – and unemployment is a problem which undermines Europe"s social cohesion – and that the achievements of this Europe in areas such as the welfare state are being undermined by neo-free trade policies, which are those same neo-free trade policies in which you exalted the need for flexibility in previous speeches and which, however, brought a reduction in the quality of work and life, in contrast to your proposals for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We suggest that you reflect on the need for a change of direction. Even this debate seems to point to two testing grounds: one concerns the relationship between Europe and the world, and the other concerns European construction and the individual situations in the different countries. The negotiations on the WTO and world trade will be the testing ground for Europe, to see whether it will be able to temper the first principle of the free trading of goods, which dominates today, with the need to protect working conditions throughout the world, environmental conditions and the health of the world"s populations and Europeans in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The other testing ground is that of Europe. Here we have a Stability Pact which is making it increasingly difficult to respond to the problems of unemployment. Even the costs of the war are by now placing strain upon the Stability Pact, which was already being challenged by a growth rate so slow as to be completely inadequate for the problems of Europe. Here you are right, Mr President. There is a need for flexibility, not in the labour market, but regarding the Stability Pact. Maybe it should be suspended, but in any case, growth investments need to be considered outside of this context and a qualified enlargement policy put forward. Without these, there will be no possibility of either making good the democratic deficit or reducing the lack of confidence of the people of Europe in their current institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that we are preparing for a constructive debate on the work that awaits you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To some, you appear to be a Socialist, others would call you a Christian-Democrat and the latest news paints you as a Liberal. The Italian view is that you are sustaining a left-wing government; the view in Europe is that you are associating yourself with political groupings to the centre and to the right. This ambiguity does nothing to bring clarity and credibility into the political debate in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Professor Prodi is a Southerner and from a Portuguese point of view, this is something in his favour. I hope therefore that he will understand my questions, which are frank, direct and of a practical nature. They will probably be of no interest to the federalist parties of this House, but they will certainly interest the citizens who voted for me; that is, the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission"s attitude towards Portuguese farming has been one of real persecution. I will deal with the Portuguese government"s inability to protect us when I am in Portugal, but it is my duty to deal here with the profound injustice of the Commission"s decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proof of this is mad cow disease. The Commission has just extended the embargo on Portugal by another six months. At the same time, it has partially lifted the embargo on the United Kingdom. Just think about the scientific dishonesty in their decision. Portugal has fewer than two hundred cases per thousand animals whereas the United Kingdom has more than six hundred cases per thousand animals. Since the first outbreak of the disease, there have been no more than five hundred cases in total in Portugal. In the United Kingdom, more than one hundred and seventy thousand cases have occurred. Given these facts, the Commission is punishing Portugal and is seriously threatening the livelihood of one hundred thousand farmers across the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an even more serious side to this! The Commission"s decisions have been nothing but political wheeling and dealing between big States and have no basis in any kind of scientific logic. This is how mad cow disease in a Europe without borders mysteriously disappears at the border with Spain. It is pathetic, Mr President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proof of our persecution is the crisis in pig-farming. We all know about it, because it hit pig-breeders hard in several European countries, and drove them to ruin. My country"s government set up a programme of national assistance, as did others. To our surprise, and probably in order to take revenge for some other matter, the Commission is now saying that this assistance is illegal, and goes even further by saying that pig-breeders are running the risk of having to repay the sums and pay interest on them, which means that those in real difficulty are going to end up bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">In one word, Mr President Prodi, it is pathetic. If I am directing these remarks to you, it is because you decided to keep Commissioner Fischler in the agricultural domain. My question is very simple. Are you prepared to look into the matter of why Commissioner Fischler acts systematically against the interests of the Portuguese state? You see, Mr President, to my mind, the Commission is not a government, and here we have a difference of opinion: a government is what each of us has in his own State. Above all Mr President, I will only accept a Commission made up of impartial scientists, not of biased bureaucrats. I will only accept a Commission which treats big States, medium-sized States and small States equally.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 13 April last, you stated your desire for reform aimed at greater efficiency, absolute transparency and full responsibility. Since then you have frequently restated your laudable intentions in this respect. But what exactly does this reform consist of? Where is this promised revolution when you are bringing back those same commissioners who were forced to resign following the damning report of the Committee of Independent Experts?</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate mystery is why you entrust administrative reform, which must be based on the said report, to one of the four returning Commissioners. Not all of the new Commissioners seem to us to have the necessary credibility to satisfy this desire for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group will therefore be particularly attentive during the coming hearings, and as far as we are concerned there is no question of Parliament being content to be a mere registration chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">This disastrous management of the Commission must come to an end. It must never happen again, otherwise it will be the citizens who, justifiably, turn their backs on Europe. The high level of abstention in the recent European Elections is a genuine cry of alarm. It is a sign of a profound crisis of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are open to dialogue and debate, but can only pass judgment on actions rather than fine speeches. Firstly, we need to know what spirit the Commissioners are going to be working in and what approach they intend to take with regard to working with all Members of this Parliament, regardless of whether they belong to a small group or large group.</p>
<p class="contents">Last January, Jacques Santer asked for the political trust of this Parliament, under threat of a vote of no confidence, stating that we should stop looking to the past. Today, you are asking almost the same thing. How much confidence can we show in you? At best, we can give you the benefit of the doubt. If your changes only consist of technical improvements, while preserving the same culture, they will not be acceptable to us. We expect Commissioners to open dialogue with the elected representatives in the European Parliament as early as possible before decisions are taken, but above all we expect them to respect the principles of transparency and subsidiarity as well as our democracies and traditions. In that way you will provide us with the means to work with you effectively and we will all gain from our differences.</p>

It requested sufficiently equal numbers of men and women representatives and an adequate balance of political trends. I leave it to you and to this Parliament to assess to what extent you have complied, or been able to comply with this Parliamentary resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you went so far as to announce an era of change, a revolution – in which I wish you every success – and mentioned an internal restructuring which maybe Mr Kinnock will elaborate upon; the fifth, I may add, in seven years! I assure you, however, that it will not be a change in the number of Directorates-General, the fact they are called by name instead of by number, the fact that the homes of the Commissioners are scattered all over Brussels or that the use of a spokesman is consolidated which will bring the institutions closer to the great European public, the objective you referred to. What is currently lacking in Europe and our institutions is a fresh vision of the Europe of the beginning of the next millennium. Today, we live in a situation which is <span class="italic">post</span> Berlin wall, <span class="italic">post</span> Kohl, <span class="italic">post</span> Mitterand, <span class="italic">post</span> single currency, <span class="italic">post </span> initiation of enlargement, and pre-hardly anything. This is the vision, the challenge. For us radicals, the Federalist compass of Altiero Spinelli will remain an appreciation gauge, a very clear compass, which will show us whether our institutions are moving towards the consolidation of the Union, towards a more European Europe and towards political union. This, I believe, is the challenge which must unite us in the diversity of our roles, in the knowledge that those who have brought us thus far, Mr President, present and past colleagues, may deserve greater respect and perhaps even a little more generosity of spirit.</p>

We will, of course, see whether your deeds measure up to your words and we will be keeping a check on concrete achievements, but I would like to say that right from the word go that we will base our assessments purely on facts, disregarding our respective positions in national politics. I know that we are politically opposed in our own country, but we are nevertheless united in our desire to build a Europe in which the peoples of the old continent are increasingly ready to place their trust.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate your unequivocal statement regarding the urgent need to restore the faith of the citizens of Europe in the Commission. Their faith has been damaged, as we have seen from the fact that the number of voters at the European Parliament elections is ever-decreasing. It has been damaged, to our way of thinking, not only by the events which caused the resignation of the last Commission but also, and I would say above all, because of the fact that too often the citizens of Europe see the Commission as a source of bureaucratic obligations which are sometimes costly, sometimes neither indispensable nor urgent, sometimes stupid and even dangerous. These obligations seem to have nothing to do with the process of building a united Europe and, unfortunately, in many circumstances, undermine European ideals. Faith will be regained, therefore, when there is greater transparency, but especially when greater consideration is given to national and cultural differences when Directives are issued and there is greater and more frequent recourse to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater attention on the part of the Commission to the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe will also be essential. We were particularly pleased to hear you express the intention to concentrate more on both workers" rights and the right to health, including the quality of food products. The damage caused by incidents such as dioxin in poultry or mad cow disease to the overall credibility of the Community institutions is huge and cannot be repaired by words. Unfortunately, these situations often take a great deal of time to remedy, and time is not always available in the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that in circumstances such as these it is essential not only to adhere to the facts, but to do so without bringing the dynamics of national controversies into this House. Above all, there must be a closer relationship between the institution of which you are President and the Parliament. This attitude must be mutual, and I hope that one effect will be to inspire the Commission of which you are President with greater respect for the work of Parliament, and therefore to greater diligence and to produce a higher quality of responses to questions than that of the recent past.</p>

As for partisan considerations, it is clear that your Commission must represent the great political forces of the European Union, and on a Parliamentary level we must continue to work with all the large groups – and that does not mean just two groups – according to a policy of co-operation necessary for the success of our legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are defending here – and what concerns us – are the rights of Parliament in relation to the European Council. We hope that the Commission that you embody is fully representative of that difficult balance between the European Council and the European Parliament.

This is why we, on the Left, view your programme with confidence. We are not here to preserve, we are here to reform: we are here to reform European institutions and European politics and economics, because we want the Institutions to become ever closer to the people, even to those of the electorate who did not believe in our mission in the recent elections; we want a political climate which is capable of resolving issues and providing government, and an economy which is geared to building foundations for cohabitation which are fair, compatible, and mutually agreed on. From this point of view, the project for institutional innovation of which you have spoken may, I believe, be the subject of dialogue, as Mr Bourlanges just said, between the different forces within this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal we must set ourselves is a process which will take us to greater and more marked political, economic and social cohesion. This is the direction in which we must move. I am sure that you and your team – and I would like to draw attention to the balance achieved in your team – are starting off in the most favourable conditions for the successful completion of this operation. You have been appointed President of the European Commission because of the ability you displayed in governing Italy wisely and competently, because of your professional experience, which is internationally acknowledged, and because you represent a trustworthy, powerful response to the crisis which afflicted the previous Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">May I recall with pride the years President Prodi and I worked together in our national government, the difficult challenges we faced and those in which we succeeded, including that most difficult challenge for Italy – the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, you are at Europe"s helm: you face another challenge, another wager which will be taken up by the Commission as it looks to the interests of all Member States. Today, Europe needs hope and confidence in herself and her qualities. We have only just emerged from a painful conflict which forced the international community to intervene to defend the right to exist of a people excluded from their own territory; the Kosovo crisis. We entered this conflict thanks purely to Milosevic; we came out of it thanks to European cohesion, solidarity between allies and a new political climate between Europe, the USA and Russia. We are asking ourselves, what could Europe become today with a stronger and more determined political profile? We must do all that we can, and become all that we can as Europeans, taking Kosovo as a starting point, with the obligations which fall to us to set reconstruction in motion, to bring to life a policy of peace and stability for the whole of the Balkans and to bring about a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which is democratic and multi-ethnic. For us, therefore, to be Europeans means in this case to support all those forces which are fighting in Serbia at this time for a pluralist and democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect a great deal from you. We expect a great deal from this new European Commission, from the Council and from this new Parliament which is anxious to hear the position of the Commissioners. In particular, much is expected by Europe"s young people, who are waiting for concrete results regarding the fight against unemployment. Therefore, above all, we must focus our attention on the excessive burden of unemployment which is weighing heavily on our territories and on the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people, in particular, are expecting, as are we ourselves, a major new policy from the Commission for training, research, culture and the environment, and then also for economic growth and freedom – freedom from bureaucracy and petty regulations. This freeing-up of society, together with the capacity to guarantee rights, which the authorities must be able to express, can indeed create that society of equal opportunities which is the motive for our political commitment. We are at a delicate stage: practically all Member States are going to have to face national reform of the welfare state. The social state is coming into being in Europe, driven by the organised movement of workers, to help those who are weakest and most vulnerable. The task before us today is to build a new welfare state; one which will provide opportunities, which will help those who are weakest once again, but which, at the same time, will be capable of mobilising both human and material resources to promote growth, development and long-term training. In other words, this task will be able to regenerate hope and trust in Europe and in its own resources: a Europe of opportunities, as Jacques Delors would say, a Europe of growth and development, a Europe of peace and stability, not a closed fortress but an area of openness which is able to benefit growth and development in other parts of the world as well. This is the Europe we want, and we are fully confident that with you and your Commission, President Prodi, we will be able to achieve it.</p>

I share the platform this afternoon with my French colleague and I share his concerns for the future role of this Parliament. Parliament, at the moment, does not appear to be very democratic. It appears also that Members of Parliament are not very concerned as the auditorium is now half empty.</p>
<p class="contents">To get a democratic structure we have to change over the years so that Parliament is not the servant of the Commission but the Commission is the servant of the elected representatives of the electorate of Europe. Until that happens there will be extremely low turn-outs at all future European elections. It would be better if the future of Europe was entrusted to elected representatives who can be dismissed from office at elections and not to nominated bureaucrats in the form of Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Prodi, I believe that half this Parliament at least is disenfranchised because he was endorsed by the previous Parliament and just over 50 % of us were not in that Parliament. I would seriously suggest that he should put himself up again for reselection with his other Commissioners in September.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause ) </p>
<p class="contents">In the long-term, I am convinced that, while the cart is in front of the horse – and that is the Commission exercising greater policy-making influence than the elected Members of this Parliament – throughout Europe people will remain apathetic toward this institution. In the United Kingdom, we already have a very Euro-sceptic electorate. We probably are the most Euro-sceptic according to a survey conducted on behalf of the European Union published two weeks ago. If Mr Prodi and his colleagues wish to remedy Euro-scepticism and Euro-apathy, I am calling for true democracy and for the elected representatives to have much more authority over the programme and policies of this institution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was then proved right as he lost the vote of confidence of the Italian Parliament. Reckoning also that a Roman idiot would still be that stupid wherever he was, which, incidently, is reflected in the symbol on the list which bears his name for the election of this Parliament, I cannot for consistency"s sake express my faith in the President of the Commission. As a native of the Po valley who is Italian only by passport, I am fortunately immune from the national Christian Democrat type of opportunism which brings Berlusconi together with Mastella and De Mita and sees in Prodi not the impartial President of the Commissioners uninfluenced by the States, but the lavish dispenser of favours to a wide and varied assortment of Southern Italian profiteers. Although I hold some of the Commissioners in high esteem, I recall the old mafioso Neapolitan saying: ‘A fish rots from the head downwards’ and I therefore have to express my negative opinion of the Prodi Presidency.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the situation in Kosovo. I appreciate, as does Mr Prodi and as do we all, that the rebuilding of Kosovo is a very important matter. However, it is an issue which goes beyond quantitative criteria. Rebuilding is not just about construction. It is of much greater significance, involving the regeneration of the societies which existed there before the catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to believe, therefore, that the new Commission will put in place procedures to incorporate basic political, social and, of course, economic factors into the reconstruction programme. On those grounds, the question of where to locate the seat of those organisations involved in the rebuilding programme is a very important one and I would like to believe that Thessaloniki will remain the choice to serve as the main decision-making centre for the whole reconstruction project.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I would like to consider is the Intergovernmental Conference. It is a matter of great importance, so much so that, at the last Intergovernmental Conference, we examined and reached decisions on many issues which were simply brushed aside when it came to the actual signing. It is not advisable, in my view, to start off with sweeping statements and far-ranging plans at this stage. It is, however, imperative before we begin work on specific plans for specific sectors, to clarify once again what exactly we want, where we want to go and just how far we can go.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my delight in what Mr Prodi expressed regarding relations between the Parliament and the new Commission. It is clear that better progress in the advancement of the European ideal can be made when the institutions are on an equal footing and when the Commission and the European Parliament work in harmony.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tree that you have described to us has strong and healthy branches which appear to us to be a good omen for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain people have obviously expressed – is this not the case, Mr Cox? – a degree of regret at seeing former Commissioners present in your Commission, but this perhaps proves that Mr Cox, driven by a desire for polemic, had not properly read the report of the Experts which fully exonerated those Commissioners. Of course, some people, such as Mr Poettering, have been carried away, and we are not surprised, by partisan spirit, to the point of turning this Parliament into an annex of the Bundestag, but a ‘stage left’ annex, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Our attitude in the Socialist Group is clearly extremely different. We are going to take care of your Commission and to those who doubt your independence, Mr President, because you will have too many socialist Commissioners, I will reply by saying that, while you have been nominated by a majority of socialist and social democratic governments, it is the Socialist Group which has been most surprised by your first public statements. This will be a good demonstration from the outset of your desire for independence and your desire to see to it that the Commission is what the Treaty wants it to be; that is, a Commission beyond countries, beyond national sentiments and also beyond the ideological preferences that we hold here within this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have raised the spectre of the hearings. Certain people, no doubt through historical atavism, would like to turn them into an inquisition process. As for us, we would like to take the hearings for what they are, that is, as an opportunity to listen to the Commissioners, to question them, to ask them questions so that we might better understand their objective and above all to find out to what extent their expertise, competence and motivation are appropriate to their positions. It is on these bases that we will come to a certain number of conclusions, but it is not our job to treat you as if we were the judges at the final judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important for the Commission, apart from the hearings which your team will doubtlessly pass successfully, is to see what you are going to do, in other words the works which you are going to undertake. You have mentioned some of them today. From the outset, I would like to take up that of reforming the Commission. You have rightfully stressed the fact that the Commission must modernise its structures, its spirit and its working methods and I believe you have been given the means to effectively carry out that reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, urge that, by acting in that way, the baby is not thrown out with the bath water, and that it is well understood that one of the causes of failure on the part of the previous Commission has sometimes been the loss of the notion of public service. It is important that the Commission is offered the means to take on, with its new structure, its officials, whose spirit will no doubt have changed, is offered the means to take on its tasks and that it shows no hesitation in saying to the Parliament or the Council, ‘you ask us to achieve these objectives, we ask you for the means’. Otherwise the fear is that you will re-live the difficulties of your predecessor.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference. I must confess that, of the decisions taken during the Summits of the German Presidency, the idea of establishing an Intergovernmental Conference has both pleased us and worried us. We are pleased by the desire for reform; we are worried by the fact that we are returning to an old method. I was therefore very happy to hear you say that now you are going to return to what I would call the Delors method, which stimulated the 1985 Intergovernmental Conference in Luxembourg, leading to that wonderful reform of the Single Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since I am running out of time, I would simply like to make an appeal by saying that the Commission is not only an executor for the decisions of the Council and the European Parliament, and that we have now perhaps lost the taste for the discreet charm of standards for lift springs and we would prefer more initiatives from the Commission in the area of social problems. In that way you will truly be the European government that we all hope and pray for and which deserves our trust.</p>

Our fair yet strict interrogations in the Parliament will be the test of competence which each part of your team must be able to pass. However, when seen in context, Europe"s Heads of State and Government have made things unnecessarily difficult for you at the outset. This is a proposal which has an unnecessary bias. I share the agitation of my German friends, while I would also like to state that in the three countries of Northern Europe approximately one third of the votes go to the Social Democrats. Today, however, we have a proposal for a Commission comprising 100 percent Social Democrat candidates. The lack of balance may result in tensions which risk giving your team less leeway if things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor Prodi, the trust of the PPE Group in you is based on the civic spirit and the political orientation you have expressed: a policy of renewal for Europe, the ability to compete, liberalisation and free trade, co-operation and peace, an open and trustworthy administration and an EU which devotes itself to matters of common relevance in order to gain the trust of the citizens of the EU during the next century.</p>
<p class="contents">You wish to create a ‘dream team’ Good luck! I believe you will need it, but most of all Europe will need it. The challenges and possibilities for us all are great. I wish you luck and welcome you to this Parliament. The coming weeks of questions by the committees promise to be interesting. These will be fair but, as has been said before, tough.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know the areas in which you intend the Commission to work, and today you have completed and spoken in greater detail of your intentions for the reform of the Institution, and you are aware of the orientation and also of the political concerns of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make three very brief points. The first is that we agree with your objective of accelerating economic union by means of a political Europe. This objective requires close collaboration between the Commission and Parliament, whose composition democratically represents the citizens of Europe and must therefore contribute fundamentally to the reform of European Institutions. This is where we must search for that European soul which is essential for the future of the continent. But although we need first of all to reestablish trust between the Institutions and the people of Europe, we consider that it will be necessary to establish a relationship of close, loyal collaboration between the European Institutions, and therefore between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the objections and the debate which we will resume in September. I think that the primary reason for the objections is to verify the compatibility between the selections that you have made in putting together the team which you introduced to us today, and the general themes which you have presented to this Parliament. We fully support a strategy which is motivated by the conviction that it is essential to respect the Stability Pact, and we are in agreement with the idea that today the fundamental issue is to make Europe into a more competitive unit, in order that it can resume the path of development, and also in order to combat unemployment. However, we also consider it necessary to emphasise the opportunity to highlight the reasons why there has been recent talk of an Employment Pact as well, and the need to devote great attention to the regional imbalances which still exist in Europe. Without a European strategy from this point of view, we will run the risk that an economy such as ours will tend to concentrate its resources on the strongest areas and leave the weakest by the wayside, even though some of these have recently shown signs of great progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last thought refers to President Martens" address on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party in this Parliament during the debate on political agendas. He expressed strong support for your candidacy, and I invite him to deal with a few issues which are holding back the activity of the Commission. I believe, however, that notwithstanding the peculiarity of the constitutional nature of relations between the Commission and the Parliament, the concerns voiced regarding the political balance which exists in this Parliament but which is not reflected in the Commission are well founded. We hope that the hearings will help us to resolve this point as well.</p>

The distrust between citizens and Commission, clearly caused by the inappropriate behaviour of individual Commissioners, is deeply entrenched. However, your appointment to the post of President-elect of the Commission, Professor Prodi, and the appointment of your team, which has now taken place, give cause for great hope. You are the first President of the Commission who will be able to transfer a Commissioner"s individual area of responsibility if he or she behaves inappropriately, and to dismiss the person concerned. This is a major step in the process of rebuilding trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the Commission does not reflect the majorities gained in the European elections, the reappointment of reliable Commissioners gives cause for satisfaction. The restructuring of areas of competence should also open up the way for greater efficiency and transparency. We will, though, in the interests of our citizens, be looking at each individual Commissioner extremely thoroughly. This will be a hearing though and not an interrogation. We need credible representatives for it to be a strong Commission. This is why we urgently need the relevant information though. It is necessary that the findings of the Committee of the Wise Men"s second report be distributed suitably in advance of the hearings. Otherwise, the seeds of a new crisis between Parliament and the Commission will have been sown. Any delay in the appointment of the Commission would not be in the interests of our citizens either.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the great tasks ahead, whether it is enlargement, the Intergovernmental Conference or reconstruction in Kosovo, the European Union must be able to act at all levels as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi, </span></span>   <span class="bold">President-elect of the Commission</span> . – <span class="underline"></span>(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate, which has been in-depth, clear and in many cases, extremely comprehensive and which has mostly demonstrated open confidence in our future work. I say open confidence because all those who spoke, even those who criticised the composition of the Commission, acknowledged the need to work closely together in a major, intense undertaking and recognised the fact that the future of the European Union lies in collaboration between the Parliament and the Commission. It is we and our collaboration which will form the basis for the way out of the current crisis, a crisis so serious as to reduce the number of voters who turned out at the last elections to among the lowest proportions in European political history.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, at the end of this mandate, one gauge of our success will be the numbers who vote in the next elections. That will show whether we have managed to restore the faith of the citizens of Europe in the Institutions for which we are responsible. This means transparency, a whole cleaning up operation which will not be easy to conduct. It is easy to promise – and I have committed myself fully on this matter – but I also know very well that it is not an easy promise to keep. A little while ago the electoral symbol for my candidacy – a little donkey – was invoked with charming irony, and I was invited to be stubborn, an invitation which was unnecessary as I am pig-headed by nature. However, I would like remind you that I was prompted to choose the donkey while reading a passage from Leonardo da Vinci, in which, while he is describing the donkey – although I cannot vouch for the truth of the statement for lack of proof – he said that the donkey is a strange animal because rather than drink dirty water it will die of thirst.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to take the donkey as the symbol of our politics because, in this five-year term, we must try to do likewise. I am perfectly aware that it is easy to make these resolutions but that it is not so easy to keep them, but the method we used to build the Commission, Mr Poettering, was a very open one. There was no night of long knives, no investiture struggle and no border fighting. It was not an easy task to bring together fifteen countries, north and south, and diverse political situations. As for the result, when I say ‘balanced’ we know full well that there is discontent in some countries, but that is politics: balanced means that the major forces present in the European Parliament are very well represented in terms of personality and portfolio size in the Commission. You can analyse the composition of the Commission in as much detail as you like. I repeat, within the bounds of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I have taken full advantage of all the power conferred on me, and I believe that one improvement at the end of this mandate may be more advanced ways of forming the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, please consider the progress made with regard to other areas. Please consider the fact that we have arrived here with a Commission which will work hard – well or not so well, we will see – whatever the case, which is able to agree on common programmes and the Members of which are ready to face their responsibilities, individually and collectively. I reiterate this point because there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the manner in which we will conduct the audiences, hearings and inquiries. I attach very great importance to this aspect of things, as I attach very great importance to the Wise Men"s report, but I also believe that these inquiries must be made into the history of the Commissioners and their programmes, and must be carried out in great depth and with political serenity as, in my opinion, they cannot be the tool to regulate problems which occurred in the past. Having said this, I believe that they must be explored in more depth and that there must be hearings which go right to the bottom of the Commission"s problems, because, and I am right to do so, I have taken on board the warning that prevention is preferable to the Commission being subsequently thrown into crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier today, in my address, I said that I have asked all the Commissioners to give me their word of honour that they would resign should any new event take place or should there be any hidden fact. I believe that this tool will not be used lightly, but with the sense, however, that the problem in question involves not only individual responsibility but also the efficiency and responsibility of the entire Commission team which must present itself to you as capable of governing for the next five years. Clearly, we have to present ourselves as individuals, but we must also present ourselves as an organically composed group, not as distinct individuals which are separate from each other. This has been the endeavour of the past few months and this is the type of Commission which has been introduced to you. Please assess it in this way. Therefore, I consider that the vote on 15 September will be enormously important. I believe that you have the right to reject the entire Commission and consider it inadequate for the great task of leading Europe in the next five year period and making its contribution to the great task before us. Well then, I invite you to perform this task according to the vision of European common interest, and not in a context, although absolutely legitimate in politics, of individual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by returning to a couple of points which have been recalled and raised today. Firstly, the Wise Men"s report. I believe that it is very important for us to have read the first of these carefully and to have measured against it many of the thoughts which I have expounded to the Parliament on the three occasions in which I have come here. This report does exert an influence, but we have to understand that the political responsibility of the future is our own. The Wise Men"s report is a wonderful instrument, and we must read it and reflect upon it, but the decision is ours alone to make and its consequences ours to bear, and it is in this sense that the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission takes on a completely different dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, several speakers have invoked the question of international trade, which I did not bring up because it will be discussed in September. I can assure you that it will be very important to maintain a balance between the need for free trade, which is one of the foundation stones of Europe, and the protection of important rights, including the fundamental health rights. This is the reason why I have highlighted the example of health with regard to food and medicine as one of the benchmarks for the our future Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are. This is the path we have to follow. As Mr Barón Crespo said, quoting Manzoni: ‘<span class="italic">Adelante</span> ’<span class="italic"> </span> but ‘<span class="italic">con juicio</span> ’, ‘Go on, carefully’. The quotation is not complete, however, because there is another sentence. In fact, Manzoni says: ‘<span class="italic">Adelante, Pedro, si puedes</span> ’, that is ‘Go on, Pedro, if you can’, and this power to move forward is in your hands.</p>
