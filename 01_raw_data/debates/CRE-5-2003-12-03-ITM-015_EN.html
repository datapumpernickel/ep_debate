<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on 23 July 2003, the Commission presented its proposal to simplify and rationalise the current situation with regard to reduced rates of VAT. This proposal, based on Article 93 of the Treaty, is intended to harmonise legislation to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market. Therefore, the Commission could not support modifications to its proposal that represented a step backwards. Having said that, I should like to make the following comments relating to the report presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that it is not the time to make drastic changes. That is why the Commission did not propose any change to the level of the rates or the optional nature of reduced rates for Member States. On the other hand, it is necessary to rationalise the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The limited extension of Annex H, proposed by the Commission, is intended to reduce the discrepancies between Member States rather than increase them, in line with the objectives of the internal market. The extremely difficult discussions in the Council on this issue have highlighted the radically divergent views on the question of VAT and the use of reduced rates. That reinforces my belief that the Commission's proposal is a balanced one.</p>
<p class="contents">Any amendment which introduces new reduced rates in sectors where the standard rate is currently applied, such as for CDs, would be unacceptable, all the more so because the application of reduced rates could create competitive distortions. The addition to children's shoes and clothes is also unacceptable. Only three Member States are allowed to apply zero or super-reduced rates by temporary derogation. All other Member States are obliged to apply the standard rates.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes to maintain the present derogations, but suggests establishing a new annex to the sixth directive, which would include all the supplies for which only one Member State has a specific derogation, thus permitting all Member States to apply a reduced rate to such supplies. I am not convinced that this solution is feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress that the Commission still favours a real phasing-out of these derogations. Politically speaking, they have always been considered transitory and due to disappear at a certain moment. Already in 1967, 1977, and again in 1992, at the time of the introduction of the internal market, the Council decided to authorise the Member States concerned to maintain these derogations. However, no absolute deadline was set by the Council. This does not mean, however, that they can remain indefinitely. That is why I am still convinced action is needed in view of the forthcoming enlargement, in order to give all Member States, both present and new, equal opportunities and to create a level playing field. I should like to remind you in this context that, for acceding countries, concrete deadlines have been laid down for all derogations. Finally, I should like to come back to you on the results of the last Ecofin meeting, which invited the Commission to extend Annex K for two further years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also received a letter from your rapporteur which urges the Commission to extend the duration of Annex K for at least six years, in order have a total period of application of ten years. I should like to take this opportunity to explain why I am convinced that an extension of Annex K is not a realistic solution.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Member States' and the Commission's reports have clearly shown that reduced rates are not a cost-effective way of creating employment. I have, however, already indicated to the Council that I was prepared to turn a blind eye to those Member States which, after the 1 January 2004, would continue to apply the reduced rates introduced within the framework of the experiment of reduced rates for labour-intensive services. This was to give the Council more time to find a solution based on the Commission's proposal. Such a situation could only continue for a short period of time: that is why I spoke of a period of six months.</p>
<p class="contents">An extension would merely postpone, once again, a solution to this problem. Moreover, it could give rise to the expectation that the experiment would become permanent. A simple extension would, moreover, exclude other Member States, and in particular the new Member States, from being able to introduce reduced rates in the sectors concerned and would therefore be an added source of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, I should like to remind Parliament that the Commission has already proposed to introduce, once and for all, housing and domestic care services into Annex H. That is part of the exercise of rationalisation of the present situation and takes into account the fact that reduced rates are already applied by a majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, for the reasons I have outlined, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and I should like to invite Members to reconsider very carefully their position on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in view of the Commissioner’s comments, I would ask the House’s Bureau to consider once again whether it might be more important to allow the rapporteur to speak first, since we are part of the legislative process and the Commission is merely making a proposal. I think this is a fundamental problem relating to parliamentary democracy, and one that we must address.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the matter at hand, I would like to begin with the last point. This House has lobbied in favour of a reduced rate of VAT for labour-intensive services. Regrettably, this was not adopted as mandatory by the Finance Council but was merely introduced as an option, and some Member States have put it into practice. However, it has been implemented very tentatively, so we have very little experience on which to assess the impact of this reduced rate of VAT on work and the black economy. That means that after two years, we did not even know whether this provision would be extended for a year, and we are aware that many companies were not prepared to take the risk and therefore did not participate in the experiment at all.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me ask you this, Commissioner. If we take a simple service industry such as hairdressing, where we can see that there has been an increase in the number of employees and self-employed persons – thousands in Spain, and hundreds in Luxembourg and Belgium – should we not take this as a sign that what has been happening is something that we really must evaluate? Moreover, do you think it is right that after such a short time and based on such poor analyses by the Member States, you are nonetheless concluding that the reduced rates of VAT really have had no impact on employment, especially given that in some sectors, the figures tell a very different story from the ones in your reports? That is why I urge you to extend this provision – if not for ten years, then for six years, not six months – for otherwise, there will be no legal certainty for the companies involved and we will also be unable to determine whether there has been any change in behaviour on the part of the clients and the businesspeople themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the fundamental principle underlying your proposal. I am very sympathetic to the idea of a systematic approach to reduced rates of VAT, but I must ask you this, Commissioner: the whole point is to move towards a definitive VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, so that we can introduce this and finally establish genuine and systematic clarity. We still have a long way to go before we reach that point. Indeed, we really cannot see how any progress on the issue of VAT is to be achieved at all. Therefore as one of the MEPs concerned, the question in my mind is this, and I put it to you on behalf of my committee and on behalf of this plenary as well: Do we need rules in areas where competition is not distorted and where the functioning of the internal market is not affected? You have mentioned children’s clothing and children’s shoes, but you yourself are listing children’s car seats for a reduced rate of VAT. I really do not understand the argument any longer, Commissioner. I also think it is very important to make it clear that in the European Union, it must be permissible to promote culture using different instruments and approaches. If some Member States choose to go down the tax rate route and others prefer direct subsidies, we must be saying to ourselves that this House is committed to the principle of subsidiarity, and only to the Community principle where there are actual distortions of competition. I cannot see that in the areas identified in our report, the functioning of the internal market is in any way impeded, and I also cannot see that consumers are being invited to cross borders in order to purchase products or services or distort the market. That really is not the case. That is why I believe that we are not yet at the stage of being able to implement your ideas. I ask you, too, to show understanding for citizens who want to treat the internal market as their home market. I therefore take the view that tax legislation must take account of these citizens’ interests. I think our report offers a promising approach for compromises that serve the interests of a well-functioning EU home market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Commission has recently developed the bad habit of confronting us with proposals, among other things, on the pretext that they dismantle distortions of competition in the internal market and rationalise the VAT system. Unfortunately, they are counterproductive in the current climate. The proposal before us is a case in point. Our rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has displayed moderation and realism in preparing her report, and I pay tribute to that. She has also demonstrated these qualities again very comprehensively in her speech.</p>
<p class="contents">We have generally followed her line because she wishes to make it possible for the Member States to retain their reduced rates of VAT. This applies especially to the reduced rates for labour-intensive services, such as hairdressers and others, which were introduced in 2000. It would be wrong, in the current economic climate, to trigger higher inflation by substantially increasing VAT rates. In my country, for example, this increase would entail a leap in the VAT rate from 6% to 15% for the labour-intensive services listed in Annex K. This special provision was intended to create jobs and reduce ‘black’ working. It expires at the end of the year and is not renewed in the Commission’s proposal, for according to the Commission’s report, its dual objective – which I have mentioned – has not been achieved. However, we do not share this view of things, and nor – as Mrs Randzio-Plath has explained – do the many other people whom we have consulted. It is also doubtful whether an experiment conducted over just three years can be described as a failure after such a short time. It would be premature to draw conclusions at this stage. Unfortunately, I see no good will on the part of the Commission, and our committee has incorporated most of the services listed in Annex K into the expanded Annex Ha so that the reduced rates will continue to apply if the Member State so wishes. On behalf of my group, we have tabled amendments enabling the Member States to continue the experiment at least until the new directive enters into force. If these two amendments are rejected, the provisions of Annex K – Mr President, I still have the two minutes allocated to Mr Karas, who is not here – will expire at the end of the month. The Member States would then have to increase the rates before being allowed to reduce them again in a matter of months when the new directive comes into force, when many of these services will be eligible for the reduced rates. The situation would become quite farcical.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment, which I have tabled on behalf of my group, would permit the Member States to retain the parking rates of at least 12% for a further 15 years, so that the changeover would not have to take place abruptly over night, which I think is reasonable. Despite what the Commissioner would have us believe, nor is there any need to follow his line in the interests of enlargement. I hope that the Commission will see sense and support our very reasonable proposal, and if it does not do so, I trust that the Council of Ministers will vote unanimously to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, it looks like he is increasingly on his own in his puritan rejection of the use of the instrument of reduced rates of VAT, which is still being deployed as an experiment, to promote employment. At the time of the autumn 1997 employment summit in Luxembourg, the idea of reduced rates of VAT was mooted here in this Parliament. This idea already met with resistance then from the Directorate-General dealing with tax cases and from a number of Member States. Despite this, it was decided to carry out, in a very select number of labour-intensive sectors, an experiment which would definitely not result in any cross-border distortion of competition. It was in these that the Member States were allowed to apply the reduced rates of VAT. However, it had to remain an experiment, limited in time. People could not agree beforehand on clear criteria whereby the experiment could be assessed. This evaluation was also done too late, the experiment had to be extended first, and the evaluation was left up to the Member States and badly coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, the first evaluation report met with strong criticism, and a re-appraisal done at the request of parliament yielded many positive results. I do not have the time to enter into the detail of this, but I think that you are familiar with those reports. I have noted nonetheless that, eventually, you only adopted the negative tenor of those evaluations and have written the experiment off with what amounts to only the prejudices that preceded the experiment. There was wide indignation in the Netherlands about the simple termination of an experiment that had been found to be effective for hairdressers, cobblers, decorators and bicycle repairers – and this in times of recession, no less. After all, you do not need economic models in order to figure out for yourself that the re-introduction of the high rates will cost a very large number of jobs. I am delighted that this indignation is widely shared in this House as well. Moreover, the following logic is applied here: if there are no cross-border or competitively distorting effects, why would the EU prohibit Member States from applying the VAT rates that they think are sound? Why would governments and parliaments not be allowed to weigh up for themselves the goals to collect as many taxes as possible or to promote employment and make moonlighting legal? The Council of Ecofin Ministers has now also clearly and unanimously announced its wish to extend the experiment and to remove the current uncertainty for those involved. In my view, your response in this matter to ignore this request and only to promise to tolerate the illegal continuation of the experiment does not show much respect for European rules and for the way they are implemented in the Member States. 'Tolerance' – surely that can only be intended as a joke on the part of the Commission as Guardian of the Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to urge the Commissioner once again to make a definite, formal proposal to extend the experiment, and to do so before the end of this month, and definitely before 1 January 2004. After all, it is quite clear that there is wide support here in the European Parliament to include the experiment of Annex K in a structural insertion of these labour-intensive services in Annex H of the Directive. It is also clear, though, that this will not be done before 1 January. The sooner the structural facility becomes operational, the better. This will receive our unqualified support and as long as that is not the case, the experiment must remain in force on a formal footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Added to this is the fact that we are bombarding each other with various research reports that make conflicting claims about the impact on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it is high time that the Commission adopted the Council’s unanimous verdict and continued the experiment.</p>

<p class="contents">We are no less in favour of continuing to maintain reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services, which began as an experiment in 1999. In its report evaluating the experience, the Commission was sceptical, particularly with regard to the effects on employment. Finally, it proposes certain continuations, which is positive, but it includes them in a broader plan aimed at eventually doing away with the derogations, which gives rise to pointless discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">As elected representatives, we see the benefits of these VAT reductions on the ground. The report provided by France also emphasised this. We therefore believe that they must continue or at least, in the meantime, that the experiment must be continued for several years along the path demonstrated by the Ecofin Council of 25 November, for example for six years, as our rapporteur has just proposed. It also seems to us that in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity this subject should, without discussion, be the competence of the states alone. I will supplement these assessments in my explanation of vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very good one and, like the rest of my Group, I will be supporting it tomorrow. I should particularly like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for including a number of amendments which meet the concerns of the charity sector in the European Union and in the United Kingdom as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Charities face a lot of difficulties caused by the VAT system and the amendments relating to charities in the report, and indeed tabled by the PPE-DE Group, are essential in trying to mitigate those problems. There are other problems in relation to irrecoverable VAT which, sadly, we cannot solve with this report but are also very important. These issues are important to charities across the United Kingdom including places like Chipping Barnet, in my own constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that Parliament adopts the amendment to ensure that Member States can allow a reduced rate for repairs to listed buildings. That is crucial, particularly for churches in the United Kingdom, many of which are listed. In many cases, repairs to these churches are phenomenally expensive for parishioners. These churches are not just of religious significance: they also have a social and cultural purpose within the community. The burden of paying a full rate of VAT makes keeping them in repair that much more difficult, so I very much hope that Parliament and Council support reduced rates of VAT for those kinds of repairs to historical listed buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital to preserve the existing zero rates in Member States. There is no reason why they should not be able to decide for themselves whether to levy the zero rates. I would strongly defend the United Kingdom's zero rates, particularly in relation to children's clothes and shoes. I see no reason why these should be abolished. They perform an important social function and my British Conservative colleagues and I steadfastly defend those zero rates and will continue to defend them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Council had established these rules, including those in the directive for evaluation - about Annex K. The Council - and not the Commission - also established that the experiment should run for three years. In fact, it lasted four years, since the Commission wanted more time to analyse the results. I want to stress that the Council stipulated what the rules should be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not made a proposal to continue Annex K. It does so because it is not effective. The reports that the Commission has received from most Member States - including the Netherlands and France, where opinions differ - indicate that there is no noticeable positive effect on employment. The reason is quite simple: in too few cases is the decrease in taxation passed on to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, I quote my wife, who said that she had never witnessed a reduction in hairdressers' prices. I do not know whether Mrs Lulling agrees with this, or whether she has witnessed a decrease in hairdressers' prices. My wife has not, and the reason is that the hairdressers pocket the decrease in taxation and, therefore, Annex K amounts to a subsidy for hairdressers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing against hairdressers, but why should we subsidise them? It has no positive effect on employment, and if you want to stimulate employment, it is better to reduce the social on-costs of labour for the same amount of money. One will create 52% more employment by reducing the on-costs of labour rather than reducing VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sees no reason why it should make a proposal, and that is exactly why unanimity in the Council does not work. It only works if there is a proposal, and then it is overturned. In this case, there will be no proposal and, therefore, unanimity in the Council cannot overturn what is not there. The same situation happened previously in the case of the tax-free shops at airports. There was no proposal and, therefore, there was nothing to overturn.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs van den Burg said that I do not respect the rules of the European Union. I should like to know which rule I do not respect. I am scrupulous in respecting all the rules of the European Union. It is the Council which established this entire experiment and set a three-year period. The Commission made it four years. It is the Council, and not the Commission, which said this was in order to increase employment. The whole idea therefore originates from the Council. It is an experiment, and experiments are supposed to be discontinued if they do not work. This is why they are experiments. Therefore, why should the Commission propose an extension of Annex K if it has not worked?</p>
<p class="contents">I fail to see, Mrs van den Burg, where this Commissioner is not obeying or following the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">On the wider issue of reduced rates, the standard rate is the normal rate. It is around 20% in most countries. That is the standard rate. All derogations must be construed strictly and, where the internal market and distortions of the markets are concerned, one should be extremely strict.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned children's shoes, which are zero-rated in the United Kingdom and Ireland. But if you look at the figures, it is clear that there again there are no noticeable benefits to the consumer. The differences between the prices in the United Kingdom and the prices on the Continent are the same whether the high rate or the low rate is applied. That proves that it is the manufacturer or the trader that is subsidised, but certainly not the end-consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards CDs, they are by their very nature easily transportable and, therefore, if the rates differ, there is a clear inevitability of a distortion of the internal market. At the moment, no Member State applies the reduced rates to CDs and, therefore, if we did, it would again be a step backward.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I now return to Annex K. I have said to the Council of Ministers that the Commission would not press charges or start infringement proceedings against those Member States that would continue to apply Annex K as if it were still in force - which it will not be. But I recognise that Member States may need a certain time to organise their affairs and that is why I said for the first six months of next year I will not start any infringement proceedings. But Annex K will no longer exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
