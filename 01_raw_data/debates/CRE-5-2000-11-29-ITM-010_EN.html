<p class="contents">I wish firstly to thank Commissioner Nielson for being here and for putting his commitment to this Parliament before certain other important engagements.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for which I am rapporteur, deals with the repercussions of the Commission reform on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and developing countries. It is an initiative report, because the Commission has not seen fit to consult us in any other more official way, despite the fact that it has done so with regard to other aspects of the reform. At least as important as those which we have just debated is the issue of the RELEX reform, which is the one that will offer the world an idea of the scope of the changes in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Commission’s own diagnosis of the ineffectiveness of Community development policy, this report reaches different conclusions on how to remedy it. In our opinion, that is, the opinion of the Socialist Group and that of the whole of the Development Committee, the development policy is an essential policy within the framework of Community external action, which must respond to the problems of today’s world, of which the greatest and most dramatic is underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an essential policy whose method of implementation must be modified in order to achieve the objective of eradicating poverty. These are the basic principles that we share with the Commission. Nevertheless, we believe that it has not been correct in its approach to the reform. The Commission maintains a division – albeit a somewhat blurred one – between political responsibility and executive competence, which past experience leads us to believe, will not work very well in practice. We believe that a cosmetic reform makes no sense in these times of profound change.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, surely you and your staff have asked yourselves the same questions as I have: Why not unify the cycle of cooperation? Why not allocate the competences for development in the developing countries to the Commissioner with responsibility for that area? It sounds absurd, but in fact what the Commission is proposing is absurd: that you take charge of implementing measures designed by others for certain countries considered to be developing, and of designing and implementing policies for the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Reason and experience lead us in a different direction. Perhaps the direction we propose in this report, which does not question the division of competences in the College of Commissioners, simply applies it. The Commissioner for Development should have competence for development; the Commissioner for External Relations should have competence for political relations, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">We fear that the origin of the absurdity lies in the internal debate within the Commission regarding who is who. The problem is that the consequences of this will harm the effectiveness of development policy and, what is even more serious, those people who should be benefiting from it. We will see this next year when we are presented with the assessment we are asking for of the results of the reform. The assessment criteria will be the progress made in the eradication of poverty, in the complementarity of Member States’ policies, in the degree of coherence between Community policies, in the efficiency of project management, decision making and the simplification of procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">These latter aspects particularly effect the NGOs. The NGOs, Commissioner, are one of the pillars of Community cooperation, providing added value for European development policy and great care must therefore be shown in taking them into account. The importance of the large multilateral organisations does not cancel out that of the small NGOs, and I am not going to expand on the role they play in development at local level because we are all aware of it, especially those populations that benefit from their action.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it to be essential that the hitherto fragile dialogue between the Commission and the committee for liaison with development NGOs be consolidated. We wish Commissioner Nielson the greatest success. We ask Commissioner Patten for the greatest generosity for the sake of the effectiveness of development policy, to which we are all committed and whose consequences are immeasurable in political and human terms, in both a positive and a negative sense. We demand from Commissioner Kinnock, who has just left, the greatest transparency in the management of the reform and the necessary efforts in the field of human resources. And we will call all of them to account.</p>
<p class="contents">We remind the Member States that there is no place in European construction for temptations to renationalise; on the contrary, it is time to defend the European dimension of this policy by contributing to its rationalisation. Complementarity is one of the key elements for the success of the Community development policy and there should not be theological debate like the one in which subsidiarity has become bogged down.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the great merits of this report is that it highlights the crucial need for the European Union and its Member States to conduct a large-scale development policy, which alone can reflect the culture and influence of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">First let me remind you of a few statistics, to avoid any complexes about our current activities. We must say it and repeat it: the European Union and its Member States provide more than half the public development aid. Contrary, therefore, to what is often assumed, the Community is committing itself more and more, in the strict sense of providing European aid. Thirty years ago, it provided 7% of international aid; today the figure is 17%.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990, total external aid from the European Union accounted for EUR 3 billion. Today, ten years later, the figure is nearly EUR 9 billion. Of course this is not enough, but it should at least protect us from caricatures about our poor record of development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we have to remember one incontrovertible fact. It is that some Member States pursue their own development policies alongside the European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view we can improve the global situation if we take a pragmatic approach and try to coordinate the Member States' activities as closely as possible with those of the Community. At that price, I believe, we can achieve complementarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, that is in line with the declaration on regional policy of 10 November, an important Council and Commission policy. It introduces a division of labour between the Commission and the Member States, on the basis of their comparative advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we must beware of two equally dangerous traps: the gradual renationalisation of development aid on the one side, on the other a Utopian vision of the Commission as the sole player in the development aid field. Nevertheless, the reform of the European Commission is moving in the right direction in proposing both more effective action by the Commission and giving more responsibility to the beneficiaries of the development projects. Of course, as some speakers have pointed out, that raises the question of human resources, which have been inadequate until now. I shall not dwell on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by emphasising three amendments I tabled on behalf of the PPE Group, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4. The underlying idea is to turn the European Union into an active rather than passive partner in development aid, but also the concern to improve the use of the allocated funds. The PPE Group will vote for Mrs Sauquillo's report, while hoping the amendments it has tabled can be incorporated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is a super power in economic terms and so it is absolutely right that we should be having this discussion subsequent to the debate on the White Paper. It was an excellent idea of Mrs Sauquillo’s to include the part on external relations in the section on internal training, thereby making it an item on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We have big problems. The Commissioner has also referred to this in his texts: a huge backlog, lack of objectives, a culture of fear in the departments dealing with payments, and at the same time, far too low a level of project proposals, a great deal of time wasted and little in the way of efficient spending. We want to work towards a culture of greater accountability. We want to see ex-post control. We want to see increased accountability for the public service and we want to see decentralisation. We want to see a European development fund become integral to Parliament. We want clearer objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament foresaw all this in terms of its role in the draft budget for 2001. We will come back to that later because that in itself constitutes a sound framework. We have our doubts about the technical mould in which the reforms are now being cast. We think it is more important to have a clear distribution of political tasks: a Parliament with clear objectives, a Commission with a clear idea of what it wants, a Commissioner – and I fully support Mrs Sauquillo in this – who has hundred per cent responsibility for the whole world when it comes to development policy, and who is given full responsibility for this within the Commission, and also the human resources they need, because without these human resources it is of course absolutely impossible to implement this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To briefly sum up: let us put an end to this culture of fear, also amongst the officials. Let us build trust between our Parliament, the departments and the Commissioner so that Europe can deliver a different kind of message in a world of poverty. Feyenoord was known as the football club of ‘deeds, not words’. May the Commissioner take this motto to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, as is hoped in the explanatory statement, the reform brings about greater involvement of the European Parliament, we will have to establish a sort of policy which does not merely stop at money or budget headings, which, in practice, take the form of tangible aid to less developed countries. Aid does not just mean donating money but<span class="bold"> </span>providing practical assistance in times of difficulty or for things which they would not be able to do themselves or without assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and need are not just the product of economic backwardness and development problems but are often the result of aggression and the exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the selfishness of the capable in the face of the weakness of the marginalised. Before we start to talk about aid to projects, we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation, identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need. The reformed Commission must establish a project, before dispensing aid, to investigate the causes which have created or contributed to creating a state of discomfort among the poor peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">We often talk about cancelling the debt of the less developed countries. The phrase would lead us to believe that it is an act of altruism or great generosity but, when all is said and done, it may be merely an act of justice. The Commission must also ensure that this happens at international level. In this way, quality of life will improve and the gap between the poor, who are becoming increasingly poorer, and the very rich, who are exploiting these situations and becoming increasingly richer, will be lessened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have today returned from Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for brilliant humanitarian assistance following the flood disaster, but, once again reconstruction projects, where we have already allocated the money, are delayed while signatures in Brussels are awaited. Reform of external assistance “yes”, sufficient staff numbers to manage projects “yes”, decentralisation to delegations “yes”, increased emphasis on programming, movement to <span class="italic">ex post</span> financial assessment, streamlined comitology arrangements “yes”, “yes”, “yes”.</p>
<p class="contents">Late at night, when we have to be clear, even blunt and when my esteemed colleague, Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, has had to use the instrument of an own-initiative report to ensure parliamentary accountability, the Commission should listen when European Parliament says “no”.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the emasculation of DG Development will <span class="italic">de</span>form not <span class="italic">re</span>form external assistance. We want a single development directorate covering policy and implementation, covering trade and aid, covering Asia, Africa and Latin America, when the Commission still proposes to peel off these other policy areas, still proposes a hybrid with programming undertaken separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we demand an end to the practice of draining external assistance away from developing countries towards the EU’s own borders in recent years. The reform communication of 16 May does not once mention the word “poverty” nor does the General Affairs Council Resolution of 9 October. We need to ensure the EU lives up to the promises made at the UN summits, that development is paramount, and to do so by guaranteeing a fixed percentage of external assistance to the world’s least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should understand that Mr Patten’s proposal for aid responsible to a board of Commissioner directors with Mr Nielson as Chief Executive is an unworkable gimmick borrowed from management text books and is fundamentally incompatible with the collegiate structure of the Commission itself. It is precisely because Mr Nielson is loyal to that collegiate responsibility that he will doubtless defend the proposal tonight. So I hope others in the Commission will hear us when we say we have a highly effective development Commissioner. Let us give him the political responsibility to do the job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report told us how, in fact, poverty and under-development continue to gain ground and that a huge number of people are still unable to exercise their inalienable right to live in dignity. Furthermore, there is the fear that the process of economic globalisation will increase the difficulties of the poorest countries and widen the chasm that separates them from the wealthy countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment. If the European Union wishes to fully implement its policy of solidarity and finally eradicate poverty and its causes, we must begin to reassess the Union’s actions and the approach it should adopt towards its development aid policy, with a view to improving the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Mrs Sauquillo’s report and the proposals contained in it are so timely – and I would also like to congratulate her on her work – because they indicate the direction which the European Union should take in responding to the challenges of the twenty-first century in the field of development cooperation. These proposals have been drawn up on the basis of an assessment of the current situation and take account of the obstacles which hinder progress in this field and discuss, in particular, the reform of the Commission’s services: greater competences for delegations and an increase in human resources devoted to development policy, the allocation of financial resources in accordance with the objectives of Community development policy, the simplification of administrative procedures and – of course – the complementarity and coherence of the Union’s development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the Commission and the Council are receptive to these proposals and that together we can make speedier progress towards the ultimate eradication of poverty, thereby contributing to the creation of a fairer world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, when preparing its proposal for reform, the European Commission did not include amongst the people it consulted those of us in this Parliament who deal with the issues of cooperation and development. Therefore, on its own initiative, Parliament’s Committee on Development and Cooperation decided to present the report which we are currently discussing. In this report we advocate the idea that the policy of cooperation for a fairer, more balanced and stable world is not some sort of secondary issue, but that it should be a real priority in European Union policy and that, furthermore, the efforts which we make in pursuit of this objective must be considered to be a substantial part of our project.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, in Mrs Sauquillo’s report we draw attention to certain measures within the reforms proposed by the Commission, which we consider to be mistaken. For example, they propose an institutional structure in which the body responsible for formulating cooperation policy and the body responsible for implementing that policy are not one and the same. Our Committee shared the view of the rapporteur that the Commissioner for Development should both formulate and implement policy in this area, although these should be coordinated with the other policies dealing with external activities.</p>
<p class="contents">What seems to us even more serious in the Commission’s proposal is the territorial separation, which is maintained. It does not seem reasonable that the Commissioner for Development should deal almost exclusively with the ACP countries while relations with Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean region – which of course are very much cooperation and development issues – should remain in the hands of those responsible for external relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It agreed today in the creation of the new office responsible for European cooperation from the identification of activities to implementation. The process of implementing the Commission’s decision of May on reform of external relations is going well.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main elements to the reform: the enhancing of the programming process; the reunification of the management of the project cycle; and the devolution of powers to our delegations, all are making substantial progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards country programmes, the Commission has adopted a standard framework for country strategy papers. This was discussed during the recent development council and was positively welcomed by all Member States. We now have a harmonised scheme to draft country strategy papers and indicative cooperation programmes in all developing countries. This will put the country concerned at the centre of the process, and it will also provide a basis for close coordination with Member States and other donors involved in that country. This is the tool we have missed in the discussion over many years about how to coordinate better. The clear focus of our action on fighting poverty as part of our overhaul of the policy framework and concentration on a limited number of sectors will be key elements in improving the impact of our cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Commission, the inter-service quality support group has started work under the chairmanship of the Development DG. It will ensure that strategy papers follow the agreed framework and methodology and I am confident that this group will bring more quality and consistency to our country strategies. This covers the whole geography and it makes also a big improvement as to the consistency with the policy we are backing.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I shall with my colleagues, the external relations Commissioners, very soon submit to the college legislative proposals to modify the rules relating to the legal basis for all external relations instruments and budget lines. This will allow the management committees to focus their work on strategies and not on individual projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reunification of the project cycle, the creation of the new office has now been agreed today formally in the Commission. The office will be responsible for the management of all steps of the project cycle. As from the beginning of next year, 250 officials will be transferred from the Development DG and the External Relations DG to the office and gradually contractual agents will also join the staff of the office while, in parallel, the technical assistance offices will be dismantled. Here also, things have moved quite fast with the help and understanding of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a programme of devolution of powers to the heads of delegations has been set up. In three years, about 120 delegations or officers will see major improvement in their working methods. Together with extended financial powers they will receive upgraded computer systems and telecommunications. Here again the understanding of the budget authority has played a crucial role for funding this major reorganisation of the European External Service. In 2001, for instance, financial responsibilities will be deconcentrated to 22 delegations, 15 more delegations will see their computer facilities upgraded and 40 additional posts of officials will be allocated to external services. The creation of SEM in 1998 was a first step towards improving the speed of delivery of 8 programmes. Even if that reform were clearly insufficient, and this is beyond any discussion today, it did in fact lay the basis for a number of the changes which we are now pushing forward. Simplifying procedures is essential if we are to speed things up. It is also necessary to make sure that programmes can in future be easily managed by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">How could we have talked of increasing transparency when we had 46 different tendering procedures? How could we expect the delegation official to move from Morocco to Mauritania or from Botswana to South Africa when the procedures of each programme and the relevant financial management systems had to be learned from scratch? So simplifications are very necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is quite correct in identifying as problems the unclear and divided responsibilities within the totality of the cooperation cycle and the problems we have had. Moreover the creation of SEM provided no solution to the continuing mismatch between 8 voluminous administrative resources. The resolution supports a reform going further in one respect than agreed today by the Commission. It favours not just the reunification of the project cycle but of the whole cooperation cycle, including programming which now remains with the DG Development and DG Relex. On this point, I can only say that the reform is a dynamic process. The quality support group will enable a more deliberate and better-managed handover from the programming part of the total activity to the office. This is something we are giving quite a lot of attention in order to have this run smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind Parliament that the decision contains a review clause. We will have to assess how this new system works and, if necessary, we will take steps to pursue reforms further and deeper. The Commission is very much aware of the importance of Parliament’s support for the reform of its policies and working methods. I am very grateful for the supportive recommendations in Mrs Sauquillo’s report and for the very positive contributions tonight in this debate. I assure that I will do my best to keep Parliament informed of policy proposals and I welcome the invitation to the Commission to report regularly to this Parliament on the reform of the external service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
