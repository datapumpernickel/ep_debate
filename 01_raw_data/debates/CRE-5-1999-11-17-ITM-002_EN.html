This is not the first time that I have appeared before you – I have done so on numerous occasions in previous roles – but it is the first time that I have done so in my new capacity. I recently had the opportunity to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Parliament to deal with certain priority issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I recognise that this new post will no doubt require me to deal with issues of interest and relevance, not only to certain Committees but also to the plenary of Parliament. I therefore attach special importance to this opportunity to address you as a Parliament. I am resolved and committed to working closely with all of you and to keeping you informed of any political issue which may be of interest to you. I would therefore like to express here once again, Madam President, my firm intention to appear before this House whenever it becomes necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">My mandate as High Representative mainly consists of cooperating with the Member States and the Presidency and helping them to develop a common foreign and security policy. This will be my main priority. I will try – I hope – to cooperate closely with the Commission in particular, with President Prodi and with Chris Patten, who is also here with us this morning. The three of us have committed ourselves to working together and to doing so effectively. I have the support of the Member States and I hope that I will also gain your support.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens expect us to respond efficiently and quickly in the event of crises and rightly expect their concerns to be taken into account. You have a fundamental role to play in reflecting those points of view and contributing to the creation of a common foreign and security policy which is more efficient, cohesive and closer to the citizen’s concerns and which reflects the values and principles which have forged our identity as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this morning I would like to focus on two main questions. Firstly, I would like to bring Parliament up to date on some of the main issues which I have been concentrating on since I assumed my new role almost a month ago. Secondly, I would like to share one of my main priorities with you: the creation of a policy in the field of security and defence. I will briefly evaluate the progress made in recent days and I will review our perspectives for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my first commitments after taking office was to attend the summit held in Russia on 22 October. I have had the opportunity to inform the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the most important points which were dealt with there, especially Chechnya, which I am sure is a source of concern for the majority of you.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, last Monday, two days ago, the Council condemned the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya, which has caused great suffering within the civilian population and which has unfortunately forced many tens of thousands of people to disperse towards other parts of the country. The Council has asked the Russian Government to honour its obligations, laid down in international humanitarian law, to prevent civilian casualties and keep the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia open. We must continue to apply the greatest possible political pressure on the Russian authorities. They must seek a negotiated solution, a negotiated agreement through dialogue, since there is clearly no military solution to the crisis in Chechnya. The only solution must be of a political nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I have communicated all these concerns – which I am sure you share – to Prime Minister Putin on the two or three occasions when I have been able to speak to him, and to Mr Ivanov, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the last time being on Sunday night.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the other region which I consider to be of special importance is south-east Europe. On 28 and 29 October I travelled to Kosovo with Commissioner Patten, which gave us the opportunity to meet with all the political leaders of both communities as well as with the representatives of the United Nations mission in Kosovo and also KFOR, the international security force in Kosovo. We stressed the Union’s commitment to the reconstruction of Kosovo and to the creation of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo. We urged the local political leaders to support this process by showing firm leadership and we highlighted the importance of all the moderate leaders expressing themselves clearly and assuming their responsibilities so that there might be a chance of the reconciliation process succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, yesterday the Council received the mandate of the Member States to evaluate the situation of the democratic opposition in Serbia and, as from tomorrow, by means of the OSCE Summit in Istanbul, I will begin to work to this end, holding any meetings that are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Balkans, I will naturally pay special attention to the elements which make up the Stability Pact. We are working together with President Prodi, Commissioner Patten and Bodo Hombach to improve the coherence and efficiency of our activities in the region. In the coming sessions we will have the opportunity to develop these points more thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would also like to mention another of the Union’s priorities: the Middle East peace process. At the beginning of November I attended the ceremony in Oslo to commemorate the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin and I had the opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat. There is currently a clear commitment on both sides to negotiate seriously with a view to the global agreement which should be reached soon, with a deadline in February. I made it very clear that the Union is prepared, obviously, to offer any necessary aid and technical expertise so that this objective may be reached. In any event, I asked the Union’s special envoy, Mr Miguel Angel Moratinos, to maintain and continue the close contacts with the negotiating teams and inform us of any progress in the talks. In addition, tomorrow, I will once again be speaking with Prime Minister Barak at the OSCE Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, since I took up this post I have also participated with the Presidency of the Council and Commissioner Patten in various meetings of the troika. I would like to highlight the meeting which took place in Algiers a few weeks ago, the first for several years. We had the opportunity to evaluate the situation of the bilateral talks and we agreed to move ahead with the negotiations on the association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Our request, with regard to human rights issues, received a response which I would be prepared to describe as encouraging, with the confirmation that invitations have been sent to non-governmental organisations, which are active in the field of human rights, to visit Algeria. A call was also made to take advantage of the current situation to significantly improve relations between all the Magreb countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as you know, Algeria occupies an important position at the moment. Currently, it has the Presidency of the OAU. It will therefore have a decisive role to play in the preparation of the summit between the European Union and Africa which will take place next April in Egypt. In my opinion, this meeting is of great importance since it will provide an invaluable opportunity to strengthen relations between Europe and Africa. At the moment Africa is supposedly the forgotten continent and Europe cannot pretend it does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I will end by telling you very briefly that I have had many other fruitful meetings over the last four weeks: with the President of Colombia, who was also received in this Parliament in plenary session, with the President of Latvia, with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Cyprus, to try to see how we can generate impetus for the meetings which are certain to start on 3 December in New York. This afternoon I will travel to Istanbul to attend the summit of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier I referred to the question of Chechnya, which will unfortunately dominate the summit which begins tomorrow. I am sure that we will continue to put pressure on the Russian Authorities to reduce the intensity of the conflict and to make an effort to reach a peaceful solution. We will also do everything possible to persuade them to fulfil all their obligations laid down in both the OSCE Treaty and the current Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the readaptation of which will probably be approved at the Istanbul Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the charter on security in Europe, if it is signed over the next few days, will no doubt reinforce the authority of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and will make a valuable contribution to the development of a Union security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, there are many other issues which I would like to discuss with you, but please allow me, for the sake of brevity, to deal with the matter of security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I am prepared to describe the General Affairs Council which took place on Monday as historic. For the first time, the General Affairs Council met with the additional participation of the Union’s Defence Ministers and held a debate – an important one in my opinion – on the creation of a European policy in the field of security and defence. Its purpose was to prepare the conclusions to be adopted in this respect at the European Council in Helsinki, under the Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clear for some time that, if Europe wants to occupy its rightful place on the world scene, it must have a European security and defence policy, as well as a Common Foreign and Security Policy. The crisis in Bosnia, in the first place, and the crisis in Kosovo, have illustrated the fact that we need more than mere declarations of intention. We need to be in a position to act. And this means, undoubtedly, having the military capability to do so. In my judgement, one of the decisive tasks of the Helsinki Summit will be to decide what these capabilities will be, how they must be achieved and how the Union will decide to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">Much progress has been made in the preparatory work, in Berlin, in Saint Malo, in Washington and in Cologne. Important steps have, without doubt, been taken at these stages. Cologne was not an arrival point but rather a departure point and I am sure that Helsinki will be a new, very important, stage in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been moving progressively closer to a goal which I consider to be of transcendental importance. Over time the debate on defence has been becoming less abstract and more specific, more concrete. We are quickly reaching the point when we will take a decisive step forward and make our commitments a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, at the General Affairs Council, the Ministers made it very clear that they had the political will to decide in Helsinki what Europe’s collective military capability should be for the purposes of the Petersberg Tasks. Judging by the debate, I am confident that a specific, clear and concrete objective will be set at the European Council. This will, in all probability, be a challenge which will demand that the Member States carefully consider the priorities and perhaps take some difficult decisions or, at least, decisions that will not be easy, on the allocation of resources. It will surely be necessary to reassess certain priorities, the common provision of resources and the multinational distribution of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Madam President, that the debate on Monday also demonstrated that the Ministers wish the Union to have the appropriate means to assess crises and also to have clear and appropriate procedures for decision making in the event that it is necessary to take action. In my opinion, this is an essential element.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take into account the contributions and interests of those allied countries which are not Members of the Union. This means that we will have to reach agreements which will allow them to express their point of view when we assess a crisis situation and we will have to put in place suitable mechanisms which will also allow them to fully participate in operational decisions if we invite them to work with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, all these measures must also be taken – and I must stress this – for reasons of credibility. Firstly, credibility in the eyes of our own citizens. We will not be credible if we limit ourselves simply to improving institutional and bureaucratic mechanisms. If we want our citizens and public opinion to support a European security policy, they must be convinced of our will and our ability to equip ourselves with the appropriate means.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly we must be credible in the eyes of our transatlantic partners and NATO allies who are not Members of the Union. If we want them to take us seriously, we must demonstrate credibility. This means strengthening our military capabilities. If we are serious and we act seriously, our allies will also be more prepared to lend us their resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must also be credible at an international level. We must show our capacity to respond in crises, which perhaps do not threaten our survival, but which do threaten something as crucial as our moral standing, our moral stature as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the defence of our values, our way of life, our freedoms and our well-being will be achieved much more efficiently in a joint fashion rather than individually by each of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, credibility also in our own eyes. We will not be able to attain this objective if we ourselves are not committed in a clear, energetic and decisive way to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to stress that security does not just involve the military elements. This is obvious. The European Council in Cologne called on the Council to examine all the aspects of security, with a view to strengthening and coordinating all the non-military instruments for responding to crisis situations. To this end, the Finnish Presidency has carried out an extraordinary piece of work, which will be reflected in a report to the European Council in Helsinki on the non-military instruments for the management of crises. I consider it very important to continue this work. We must create mechanisms which will cover the whole range, the whole spectrum of crisis management instruments, from those which are strictly humanitarian and civil to the other extreme, which relate more closely to military aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this spectrum, we must make an effort to strengthen those instruments relating to the protection of citizens and compliance with the law, that is to say, the police instruments, the overwhelming need for which has been illustrated by recent crises. You will remember that, both in Bosnia and now in Kosovo, the problem of an international police force is still great and remains unresolved. And I know that this Parliament is particularly sensitive to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am coming to the end. If we adopt these measures and adequately resolve these problems, I am convinced that we will make a significant contribution to the development of our Europe, to the development of our continent. We will be able, without doubt, to strengthen our security and guarantee greater cooperation from our partners and allies.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to end by repeating my deep-seated intention to work closely with this Parliament in all these areas. My main task in taking up this post is to contribute to the creation of a Common Foreign and Security Policy which is more efficient, more coherent and more active. This is the only way that we can guarantee that our Union has the influence which it deserves in any part of the world. It is the only way we can defend our values and our common interests. However, this will only be achieved through close cooperation amongst all the institutions. The support of this Parliament will be essential. Madam President, I trust that my presence here this morning is only the beginning of an effective and constructive dialogue, the results of which will benefit citizens more and more, both in the Union and in the rest of the world. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I am extremely pleased to be taking part for the first time in a debate in the European Parliament with the High Representative. We are all extremely fortunate that he is the man charged with the key responsibility for developing a more effective and coherent European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">He has, as the House will know, a huge and wholly deserved international reputation for standing up for the values which have been responsible for the best of European history in this century and whose absence has been responsible for the worst of our history as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative and I have spent a good deal of our first weeks in our respective jobs considering together the terrestrial problems 30,000 feet below our aircraft seats – so much travel. It reminds me that Lord Grey, the British Foreign Secretary for ten years at the beginning of the century, only ever went abroad once. If my history does not let me down, that visit was shortly followed by the outbreak of the first world war. I suppose Lord Grey was regarded as well-travelled. Perhaps with all the travelling we do these days we are better informed than he was, but perhaps we are not.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to repeat all the points which have been so well made by the High Representative, but since you have invited me to take part in this debate, something which I greatly welcome, I should like to say a few words about the Commission’s view of the building of a European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Security and defence, which are at the heart of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, are also properly and inevitably close to the hearts of Member States. As was clearly apparent at the historic meeting – it is the High Representative’s adjective and the correct one – at the beginning of this week of the General Affairs Council attended by defence ministers, Member States believe that enhanced cooperation in the security and defence area in the European Union will bring two major benefits. First, it will enable everyone to make better use of their resources and, secondly, it will mean that everyone packs a bigger punch precisely because Member States are working more closely together.</p>
<p class="contents">These benefits are needed more than ever in the security field because more is expected of Europe today. More is expected of us by the rest of the world because of our economic success and because of our success too in building peaceful and stable democracies. More is expected of us, in my judgement, by our own citizens, who do not think of Europe just in terms of balance sheets and GDP figures. How could they possibly do so given the tumultuous political events of the last few years – tumultuous events ever since an American political scientist told us that history had ended.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has to rise to the level of events. It is as simple as that and as difficult as that. The Amsterdam Treaty and the Cologne Declaration represent a formidable challenge. But we, in the Commission, want to play our part in helping to meet it. Of course we have no military role. The sight, on Monday evening, of so many military uniforms in the margins of the General Affairs Council came as an interesting cultural development. But what we do have in the Commission is the means and the experience to make an important contribution to the non-military dimension of security. The so-called Petersberg Tasks suggest a comprehensive package of crisis-management measures where Community instruments can interact with traditional diplomacy and, if necessary, the use of military force.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we come to a crucial point. Sometimes the military dimension is essential and decisive. But the non-military dimension can also be crucial. After all, the nature of conflict has changed so radically during this bloody century. Eighty-five percent of the victims of the first world war were soldiers. Only 15% were civilians. The situation in conflicts today is almost the opposite. It is equally the case that with the increasing sophistication and interdependence of our societies, economic measures, the free flow of information and so on have become ever more important in conflict and its prevention. So the European Union has to envisage action right across the whole range of instruments at its disposal, both military and non-military.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to know just what we can contribute as a Community, look at the multitude of our operations in the Balkans. We are involved in obvious areas like humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction. But the measures we can take with the aim of preventing conflict and human suffering include many other things as well, like law enforcement, institution-building and trade policy. Those are the sort of things we are supporting in Kosovo, to which we will be pledging at the donors conference in Brussels today another contribution of EUR 500 million from the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">So what I want to make clear is that you do not have to strain or stretch your imagination, let alone strain or stretch the Treaties which determine our activities, to see the absolutely clear roles that can be played by the Commission and by Parliament. It is not just in south-east Europe that we have seen the need for coordinated military and civil crisis management both at Union level and between Member States. We can also see that in East Timor. We have to improve our ability as a Union and as Member States to manage crises and to contribute to those international organisations which are also active in this, alas, all too necessary area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki European Council will discuss an integrated approach to conflict management and we are, as a Commission, making a full contribution to that discussion. Let me make a point that some may regard as rather prosaic. In conflict prevention and crisis management, time is of the essence. The new Commission has begun work to try to improve the effectiveness and speed of response of the instruments that we have in crisis situations. That is something which Parliament has frequently requested us to do, and absolutely rightly. It is a big job. In many respects, any progress we make in this area would represent by far the biggest contribution that I could make to our rather more heroic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can count on the continued support of Parliament in developing more flexible and more rapid procedures, and as the High Representative I am sure would readily agree, I lose no opportunity to make the same point to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s role in crisis management is clear, but our role goes beyond crisis management. A European security and defence policy cannot be developed in the absence of a competitive and open European defence industrial and technological base. This is also in the interests of the European Union’s partners. We in the Commission can contribute to this with a range of instruments in areas such as public procurement, the internal market, research and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one final point. Sometimes people talk about the potential institutional conflicts in the foreign and security tasks which lie ahead. I hope they will not take exception to these remarks but I think that the issues they are talking about are too important to allow them to get mangled by diplomatic lawyers. Plainly, we have to build on the institutional framework of the Union. Plainly, military and non-military matters cannot be neatly compartmentalised. Plainly, the Commission must play its full part in crisis management even when there is a military component, because there will also be a non-military component. Plainly, the new structures must enable the Commission to exercise its full right of initiative. Plainly, the Commission is not a college of amateur chiefs of staff and plainly, we want to work successfully with the High Representative and with Parliament to ensure that Europe has the security and defence policy that it needs and that its citizens want. And if there is another plainly left in the dictionary, it is this: so long as I have my present responsibilities, no cigarette paper, or perhaps after David Byrne’s announcement on tobacco yesterday I should say no piece of tissue paper, is going to separate the Commissioner for External Relations from the High Representative.</p>

You bring with you, Mr Solana, exceptional credentials for these duties. You have been President-in-Office of the Council<span class="bold"> </span>and Secretary-General of NATO. Our Group wishes you every success, both personally and in your work; if you are successful, it means success for us all and success for Europe. The European Christian Democrats and Conservatives wish you a warm welcome to your new duties.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that if ever it was necessary you would attend Parliament. I am sure that by this you also mean the relevant committees, to wit the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. We would be highly delighted if there could be a form of cooperation with you which, although institutionally different, is on the same basis as that with the Commission, which has stated that it will attend Parliament and the committees whenever it is asked to by the Parliament. If you consider this to be necessary, then I believe we shall make good progress together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word of thank you to the other Group chairpersons who agreed last Thursday that the European Commission, represented here by Chris Patten, should be allowed to speak today. Under Article 18 of the EU Treaty, the European Commission must participate fully in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and for this reason our Group will always defend the interests of the Commission, which are also the interests of the European Union, and will always require that you work together prominently in the interest of Europe, as I think is wonderfully ensured by both individuals in question. There is no place for competition and mutual ambition; rather, we must work towards the common goal of a strong and competent Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With you as the Secretary-General of the West European Union and the West European Union integrated into the European Union, parliamentary supervision naturally takes on a new duty and, together with the national parliaments, which will retain a supervisory function, it is the European Parliament which must carry out this supervisory function. We therefore believe that the Assembly of the West European Union, which has played an important role in the past, must transfer these duties to the directly elected European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned some of the areas in which the European Union must operate, including Russia. The security of our continent will depend on how things unfold in Russia. We want a competent, democratic Russia, but we also believe that what is happening today in Chechnya is a disgrace for Russia and a disgrace for Europe. By its actions in Chechnya, in Grozny and other towns, and in the countryside of Chechnya, Russia is distancing itself from the values of Europe and I would urge you, Mr Solana, and Chris Patten, to make your voice heard today, tomorrow and in the coming days at the OSCE meeting in Istanbul. We must not remain silent! Anyone who keeps silent now and fails to make his voice heard is answerable to men, to the Muslims of Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a final comment on security and defence policy. We wish to have a European defence identity, but this must not mean that we uncouple ourselves from the USA. Rather, we must understand it as a distribution of duties and not as duplicity. We must ourselves be competent and, therefore, create the necessary preconditions in terms of transport, communication, news-gathering and modern satellites. We cannot simply leave everything to the Americans. It is also a matter of technology, as Chris Patten rightly said. This must not take place in opposition to America, but additionally. I think that if, as Europeans, we do our duty in this matter, we will generally strengthen the North Atlantic alliance and if, as Mr Solana and Mr Patten have said, we carry out these duties and you, Mr Solana, as the Commission does, undertake to seek dialogue with us whenever we consider it necessary, then my group will support you. In this regard I wish you every success in your work.</p>

I imagine that in terms of the Community budget, they will be three jobs for one salary. I wish you luck.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to sing the praises of Javier Solana. We have shared a great friendship and many years of struggle, first for the freedom of my country and then for our integration into Europe. And I expect that the defence of democratic values which he displayed in earlier incarnations will accompany him and inspire him in his new task.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time the Council has a human face – and I hope this is permanent – and I am sure that Mr Solana will be able to confront this challenge, which I believe is important not only for the Council, but also for the development of the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Since much has been said about his duty as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, I would like to mention an aspect which I consider to be important: our Common Foreign and Security Policy will be, fundamentally, a reflection and extension of our internal strength. Our ability to create a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and also a defence policy, will depend on how united we are on the consolidation of our strength. This means that Mr Solana will not only have to deal with the more immediate question of crisis prevention, but also – and he has some experience in this – that of our role in the world, that is to say, the United Nations, the Millennium Round and the future of the IMF and the FAO; it is also important in the sense that Europeans, in constructing Europe, are also doing something important for the future and stability of humanity. I believe that this consideration must inspire his activities and, at the same time, as Secretary of the Council, I hope it will allow him to help in the task of reforming and giving coherence to that institution which, at the moment, is perhaps the institution which most requires the impetus of rationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana has spoken at length on the security and defence question. I believe that he is the person who has shown himself, in this historic process, to be the most capable of seeing through the complex evolution which involves the development of a European identity in terms of defence, in which NATO itself and our North American partners are coming to accept the need for a strong European pillar, not only in the field of defence, but also in terms of the industrial dimension which must support it and also in the role of stabilising and consolidating democracy in Europe and the Mediterranean. To this end, I believe that he will have a decisive role to play at the upcoming OSCE meeting as regards the crisis in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues will comment on these issues later. I would like to conclude my remarks by speaking of the need for close cooperation with the Commission – and I am not asking Mr Patten to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr Solana. We simply need them to understand each other perfectly. And with regard to the role of this Parliament, I believe that in recent years we have shown our capacity to help and collaborate and I understand that, from the point of view of the form that the dimension and development of the Union’s defence and security policy can and must take, we can play an important role in relation to the rest of the world. I believe that, on this occasion, we must offer our cooperation and show the most positive of attitudes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, I believe, as the other speakers have said, that this is a significant formal occasion today, because we have for the first time in plenary the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. It has been said that he has three jobs but only one salary. But an even greater marvel is that he has three such great, large, heavy hats and only one head to wear them on. High Representative, we wish you every success in this task.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your role, we hope, above all, that you may contribute to closing the gap between the aspirations and reality of European foreign policy. The challenge that you undertake is at the core of what we do. To take an example, in 1992 we as a Union drew up the Petersberg Tasks which offered comprehensive non-military and military security options. The aspirations set out in those Tasks were perhaps most rudely challenged by Kosovo where the gap between aspirations and reality was cruelly exposed by an absence of an appropriate operational substance. The highest priority for you now is to begin to give operational content and meaning to both the non-military and military challenges of Petersberg, not least, given the several hats you wear, particularly the military ones.</p>
<p class="contents">My own group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is strongly committed to the general concept of developing a capacity for autonomous European action which correctly has been identified as a rapid response capability with the necessary logistical support. This will perhaps require some re-allocation of resources. This issue of cost will have to become a parallel priority in our debates. We are committed to a capability for autonomous EU action in my group. We are somewhat sceptical about the degree to which this should be autonomous of transatlantic relations. In so far as you have dealt with the issue in broad transatlantic terms, my group welcomes strongly that emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point I would like to raise is the question of the European Union and the coordination of our aid policies and our foreign policies. I should like to say to both Mr Solana and Mr Patten that there is an enormous challenge to bring greater political coherence to this task. The Union or its Member States account for half of all the world’s humanitarian aid and half of all international development aid. The Union gives three-fifths of all aid to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. But we have nothing like a proportionate say and influence in terms of foreign policy. This is a core challenge that we look to you and to the Commission to resolve in terms of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we develop this operational capacity through the Petersberg Tasks, if we develop more coherence in aid and foreign policy, how can we then adopt more coherent policies in international fora? We have a great density of institutional relations – we have touched on some of them in the debate already. In particular, I want to signal on behalf of my group an interest in the non-debate that waxes and wanes every so often about the reform of the UN Security Council. Without prejudice to the arrangements in existing Member States, it is a question that we must look at in due course. If we are really to have a non-military as well as military capacity, an effective voice at the Security Council table would be important especially in our outreach beyond Europe itself. This is therefore something we would put down as a marker.</p>
<p class="contents">In his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Solana talked about having a less declaratory and more active foreign policy. We agree whole-heartedly with that, and I would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this: in five years’ time will we have exported stability to south-eastern Europe, or will we still be importing the consequences of instability? This is for us a core challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the tenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia as it then was. I hope, Mr Solana, that you will use your role to give an added sense of political urgency to the task of enlargement, rather than to promote procrastination. I hope that you will use your voice to teach the lessons to be learned from the former Yugoslavia. It is an ambitious, difficult task. We wish you well. You will have the full support and goodwill of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the leading role played by the United States is not as unproblematic as some might think. It was found in Kosovo that military personnel can sometimes be wiser and more realistic than politicians, so we need not necessarily fear military personnel. On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I would say that the majority of our Group seem to have come to accept that the European Union could develop common crisis management strategies but we want to impose clear conditions and frameworks for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, foreign policy must be consistent; its different aspects must form a coherent whole that leads us in the same, and not different, directions. Foreign policy must also be open. Mr Solana, I have to mention that I have personally fought against the Security Council, of which you are leader, in court for more than two years, using non-military means, to obtain a certain document which concerns compliance on the part of Member States with criteria relating to the export of weapons. I hope that you will increase transparency in the work of the Council in foreign policy also.</p>
<p class="contents">Another condition that is very important is that the management of civil crises must be improved markedly. What you said is quite right: progress has been made in this area during the Finnish Presidency. Keep the two operations together. It is not necessarily a good thing to divide the tasks, with the High Representative taking responsibility for military crisis management and the member of the Commission for civil crisis management. They have to be kept together.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to lay down the condition that each operation must be independent from the others, and decisions on it must be able to be taken separately. The Member States must be able to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether they should become involved in these operations. The criteria must naturally be the same for all. We cannot accept a situation where different criteria have been applied in Kosovo and in Chechnya, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the main question here is how relations between the European Union and NATO will develop. Eleven of the present Member States belong to NATO, but four do not. We have to avoid a situation where the European Union is becoming an actual pillar of NATO in Europe. It is important that NATO and the European Union remain, in reality, distinct from one another. Such an asymmetric structure can help promote peace in the world. It does not imply weakness; it may also be a resource.</p>

I welcome Mr CFSP’s taking office.</p>
<p class="contents">In fulfilling your new role, you will find my group a demanding partner, extremely critical, if necessary, but deeply convinced that the European Union must be represented to a much greater extent, more active and more proactive, in the international arena. Wherever you go in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Asia, everywhere you can gauge the degree of expectation there is for a major ally, which is capable and resolved to assist them in extricating themselves from the demanding showdown against America which is arrogant and too powerful.</p>
<p class="contents">What splendid challenges you could devote yourself to accepting on behalf of the Fifteen: establishing yourself as a protagonist in your own right in the Near East in order to contribute towards establishing a just and lasting peace, as now seems possible; launching the Lomé negotiations once again on new bases, integrating the concerns of our 71 partners in the south, in order to safeguard the spirit of this Convention which is unique in the world; addressing international financial institutions with an alternative opinion, for example, in favour of cancelling the debt of those countries which are today arrested in their development because of this infernal mechanism; starting a real international crusade in favour of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, at this time when there is great danger once again of proliferation; establishing yourself as the spokesperson, the standard-bearer for the enhancement of the United Nations’ system again, ensuring that the UN Charter is respected, promoting a form of civilised international relations, forever doing away with war as the means of settling disputes, and, in the short term, if you please, putting an end to the intolerable inertia of the Union as regards the savage war in Chechnya by some means other than a few purely formal communiqués.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I invite you, High Representative, to make a courageous and critical assessment of the war in the Balkans. In Kosovo, we face a serious policy failure, as one form of nationalism succeeds another, as one form of ethnic cleansing succeeds another, this time with the Union, the UN and NATO in attendance. In the rest of Yugoslavia, an Iraq-style scenario is in progress. The power, which is legitimately censured, is still firmly in place, while the population, which is unfairly penalised, is enduring a martyrdom which is morally unacceptable and politically dangerous. As for the region, it is anything but stabilised. These realities cannot fail to be of direct concern to you.</p>
<p class="contents">So, do not take as the only lesson to be drawn from this terrible experience the need to be able to line up more troops, to increase military expenditure and to advance at the double towards the Europe of Defence within, what is more, the framework of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not seeking to draw a veil over the military aspect of security, but the key factor, in my opinion, is that this strategy continues to be obsessed by military matters, at the expense of a major pan-European policy for the prevention of conflict capable of dealing with the tensions and splits of the post-Cold War period on this continent. To give just one illustration of this imbalance: tomorrow, as you very briefly mentioned, fifty European Heads of State are to meet in Istanbul at the OSCE Summit dedicated to drawing up a security charter for the twenty-first century. But how many people know about this? How many people are talking about this? The Council representative did not even consider the request I made for a debate in the European Parliament prior to this conference to be appropriate. Revitalising the OSCE, re-establishing it, making its debates open to the public of European society, that is one more grand design, which is, in my opinion, inseparable from the prospect of enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the constructive message that I wished to convey to you today on behalf of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should have liked to hear you give a more explicit account, Mr Solana, of the heart of this key matter, telling us how, within the CFSP, you intend to contribute to correcting, inasmuch as it is still possible, the most disastrous consequences for this continent of the actions which you at least paid for in Yugoslavia, if you did not order them, in your capacity as Secretary-General of NATO, and which we must confront today.</p>
<p class="contents">How specifically do you plan to contribute towards assisting the civilian population, in a European country whose infrastructure we have destroyed, in getting through the ordeal of a winter which promises to be dreadful for them? How do you plan, if there were still time for this, to contribute towards curbing the total exodus of Serbs from Kosovo, or to promoting their return? It would indeed be iniquitous to be turning the prayer wheels for a multi-ethnic Kosovo if we are in fact letting it become mono-ethnic. How do you plan to contribute towards preventing the Federation of Yugoslavia being completely dismembered at a time when there is increasing pressure in favour of Kosovan independence following NATO’s intervention?</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, High Representative, how do you plan to ensure that the CFSP contributes towards a situation where the actual consequences of NATO intervention are not the exact opposite of the objectives assigned to it, to wit, a Yugoslavia which is dismembered and ruined, and which is still governed by Mr Milosevic, and a Kosovo which is extremist, mono-ethnic and independent?</p>

In other words, the EU is to be equipped with a military capacity and to become a superpower. This is plain talking compared to what the press and what government offices are saying, especially in the non-aligned countries which are Members of the European Union. But is it a military superpower that the peoples of Europe need? Both Mr Solana and Mr Patten, and most of the speakers, have revealed a sort of surrealistic <span class="italic">Dr Strangelove</span>-style logic surrounding this whole problem area, a logic which goes like this: shoot first and ask questions later. The trial run for the so-called peacemaking measures, which is of course one of those splendidly misleading euphemisms, may be seen in the Kosovo crisis and in the attack on Kosovo this spring. This is assumed to have been a success which has shown that NATO has a role which the EU should now take over because we can do so more cheaply and more efficiently than the Americans whom, moreover, we are supposed to follow through thick and thin. It was not a success. It was a disaster in every way. Several of the speakers, among them Mr Souchet, have touched on this point. In fact, something like the opposite of what was intended has been achieved. People have a distorted and hypocritical stance on the question of Kosovo’s constitutional status and status in international law, and the action in Kosovo shows first and foremost that the small nations have been made to join forces with the Allies. Their influence has been confined to that of being able to confirm decisions already taken by the large countries. It has been, in every respect, a total fiasco. In fact, it has been more than that: it has been a disaster. It is high time that the European peace movements were revitalised as a counterweight to the foolish militarisation that has been taking place in recent years, for which there is not much support to be found in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Question time to the Council has been scheduled for this afternoon and is set to cover foreign policy issues. Our Rules of Procedure have been drawn up on the basis that there is no High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. However, today there is indeed a High Representative for the CFSP. My question to the Chair is this: will Mr Solana be present and answering questions in this afternoon’s question time to the Council on issues concerning foreign and security policy for which he is responsible? Will the Rules of Procedure be modified or supplemented in any way? Is the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to be outside parliamentary control? </p>
<p class="contents">This has nothing to do with whether I like or have faith in Mr Solana. Personally, I have no faith in him and I cannot understand how someone who was a US stooge can now be responsible for European policy.

<p class="contents">Now that the Soviet Union has disappeared and danger, less clear-cut but just as formidable, today threatens from the south, the rivalries between the major Western powers have become more pronounced. Germany, rather like France in the 1960s, hopes to find in political Europe not only the opportunity to regain lost credibility but also the opportunity to find veiled resources of power politics. The real issue which is hidden behind the Europe of defence is actually access to nuclear weapons or, failing this, the removal in the long term of the French nuclear deterrent which, as everyone knows, exists when it is not shared. Although the United States did not seek the French supremacy to which it adapted extremely well, as Dr Kissinger wrote on several occasions, it would then adapt to the new situation by distancing itself from European affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the on-going interest in short-term results at the expense of the long term, a certain French President’s need for personal glorification, a score of zero, and all these discussions and other protocols of Nuremberg are in danger of upsetting the subtle geopolitical balance of power which has existed for decades between the United States, France, Great Britain and Germany. This tendency must be fought with all the necessary strength, particularly by the strict application of the rule of unanimity, without a legal get-out or differentiated cooperation. </p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to question him on this subject during his appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as to what the political means would be – and I was thinking fundamentally of the Intergovernmental Conference – to make use of the next Intergovernmental Conference to the benefit of the CFSP. At that time, Mr Solana told me that he had not yet finished considering the issue and I would like to know whether he has made any progress in this respect. I would like to know, Mr Solana, what the political, economic and budgetary means are – bearing in mind the principle that “he who pays is in charge”, which you know very well from your time as Secretary-General of NATO – to create a force which can maintain peace and prevent situations as dramatic as those which we have seen recently in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also spoken this morning of the problem of human rights. In this respect, I would like to know your opinion with regard to relations between the European Union and China, especially in light of the recent trade agreement between that country and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">And on the subject of the United States, I would like to ask you two very specific questions. Firstly: What is your opinion of President Clinton’s statement that Turkey should become a Member of the European Union? And secondly: What do you think about the pressure which the United States administration is putting on some European companies – I am referring to the Spanish Sol Meliá chain and other companies such as the Club Méditérranée and the German company LTU – and what measures, in your opinion, should the European Union take?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to ask the High Representative, with regard to our policy and relations regarding Latin America, if you think that the new European Union priorities which have resulted from the Rio Summit would require new resources. I understand that your answer is yes and therefore: What do you feel about the decision of the Council of Ministers which, on the first reading of next year’s budget, has reduced the amounts to a level lower than the amounts for 1996? What will you say in this respect to the Mercosur Ministers with whom I believe you are going to meet next week? Do you think that the new priorities on Latin America have to be dealt with using fewer resources, in opposition to what this Parliament approved in the first reading? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Solana, wearing your two hats as “Mr CFSP” and Secretary- General of the WEU, you are going to have a great responsibility in our common endeavour to establish a European order of peace. First on the agenda is the matter of complying with the Cologne decisions on crisis management and conflict-prevention initiatives. These decisions also include the Member States’ undertakings to establish a specific military capacity in such a way that the EU’s ability to take credible initiatives in accordance with the principles of the UN’s Charter is reinforced, and this without any Member State’s interests being compromised and without the EU’s taking on NATO’s basic tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, a lot of energy is being spent on crisis management, something you talked a lot about. We are seeing more and more proposals on the way. Against this background, I should like to ask you the following question. You said that our citizens feel that we ought to be able to intervene in a crisis. Yes, but I think our citizens want us to be able to intervene before crises break out at all. My question is therefore as follows: do you share the view that measures to prevent conflict are at least as important as the crisis management which in fact kicks in at a stage where politics and diplomacy have failed? What measures are you therefore going to take in the area of conflict prevention so that you can, as it were, start taking charge of preventing fires rather than turning out to fight them?</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne decision ought not to lead to our one day finding ourselves in the same situation as my second home country, Switzerland, where, following studies of possible threats to the country over the next decade, the conclusion was reached that Switzerland is well equipped to deal with dangers which no longer exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention in this context that the Conflict Prevention Network (CPN), established by Michel Rocard on the initiative of the European Parliament, warned, long before the Kosovo conflict, that war was going to break out, and that a variety of visiting delegations from Parliament did the same thing. The CPN still exists, but the problem, then as now, is that there is no structure in the Commission or in the Council which can effectively utilise the experience and expertise of the CPN and others.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said this, I would like to emphasise once more – this has fortunately already been done by many speakers – that, to my mind, the power of the European Union is, or should lie, in crisis management and the prevention of conflict. I am therefore grateful to Mr Patten who has emphatically drawn attention to this very issue. I think that he is right. I think that the power of the European Union – as already referred to by the previous speaker – lies in the fact that, before conflict spreads, every effort should be made to prevent this from happening. Within this context, I would again like to ask Mr Solana about his pledges in the Committee on Foreign Affairs following a feasibility study carried out by the<span class="italic"> </span>European civil peace corps. He confirmed this at the time and I would like to hear from him again, as this is one of the very situations in which the European Union could be effective in the prevention of conflict. </p>
<p class="contents">The question remains how autonomous this conduct of the European Union will be in future, how independent from the United States and how closely involved with Russia, for example. Your successor, Mr Robertson, has stated in a number of interviews that the EU’s conduct will largely remain restricted to minor, less significant conflicts. This remark has prompted three questions that I would like to ask here. The first one is: in your opinion, what bearing does this have on the deployment of nuclear weapons? Would you agree with me that the EU’s involvement in smaller conflicts then renders nuclear weapons completely unusable and superfluous?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you mentioned the reorganisation of funds and the making available of appropriate tools. Would you agree with me that, at present, the reorganisation of funds within the European Union is far more important than consideration being given to raising the ceiling on defence?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, cooperation with Russia: Could you be more precise about how the European Union should bring this about, independently of NATO? After all, if the majority of potential areas of conflict are either in or bordering Russia, does this not raise the dilemma of us creating something which we will only be able to use in practice with great difficulty, precisely because Russia is involved? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore a question of high expectations and, I believe, also high hopes, especially if – as Commissioner Patten said – a synergy really will be created between the two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Your task is certainly a very difficult one. I do not mean it is impossible, but a host of good wishes – which we all give you (they are free and cost absolutely nothing) – will certainly not suffice. Maybe you need something more tangible. </p>
<p class="contents">The first steps, taken in the Council at least, do not seem particularly promising. I am referring to a fact that might be considered to be of secondary importance by many, but that I think is very significant: you thought Monday’s Council meeting a historic occasion for defence. Can this be true? I, too, consider Monday’s Council meeting historic, but in a negative way and for other reasons. I refer to the incomprehensible attitude taken in respect of an initiative, promoted for once by the European Union, on the moratorium on capital punishment. </p>
<p class="contents">If I have understood correctly, this time the Ministers have decided to be particularly thorough. They have decided to stand their ground and to withdraw the proposal for a moratorium, or at least to block it. They have decided to make a huge effort to be verbosely and verbally maximalist and extremist and are refusing to give ground or negotiate … Basically, they have decided to lose. </p>
<p class="contents">This position is so astonishing that I wonder whether any of the Ministers have actually read the amendment and the facts, because this is completely incomprehensible, unless it is true, as some people suspect, that this strict, moralist position will serve to save the face of some of the great powers who are not especially interested in the proposed moratorium. </p>
<p class="contents">It does not take much to realise, Commissioner, that what we should have done was to use serious negotiations to bring moderate countries which do not use capital punishment over to our side, countries which had taken positions and which were sensitive regarding the preamble – I repeat, the preamble – based on an article in the United Nations Charter. But why are we trying to amend the United Nations Charter, Commissioner? What do we hope to gain with a proposal for a moratorium? Are we trying to reform the Security Council or change the Charter? None of this makes sense. </p>
<p class="contents">If I may say so, what happened on Monday was disgraceful. As a consequence, the European Union will withdraw – so it seems – the proposal for a moratorium, or it will not even put it to the vote. Just think about it: a freeze on the proposal. And we want to talk about credibility? The truth of the matter is that today, Mr Solana, Europe is very good at making empty, pompous announcements, but it is completely incapable of learning from history and seeing how and where we really can negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">So again, my heartfelt good wishes, but these in the form of a simple suggestion on the Common Foreign and Security policy: maybe using the process of economic and monetary union to reach diplomatic and military union would be a good way of transforming declarations of intent into more concrete steps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed an historic moment for him to appear before us. You have a set of key responsibilities which include a very political task. In fact, as I understand it, you mainly see yourself as a politician.</p>
<p class="contents">You have said that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs should be able to take far more decisions in this respect. This is necessary for your role. But this means, of course, that more economical use should be made of the right of veto. Is this what you meant to say? </p>
<p class="contents">For years, Parliament has been looking forward to adopting a clear security and defence policy. The war in ex-Yugoslavia proved to be a bitter experience. Hundreds of thousands of people died for lack of a bold EU policy or action from other international organisations. Member States often acted as a brake on any decision taking. Recent publications from the United Nations on Srebrenica once again show how various international organisations fell short of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the Union could make quite a few proposals. Mr Patten clearly stated that we have many civil options within the international system of law. But when it comes down to it, there is still no military backbone. America’s experience with Haiti has shown that diplomatic negotiations with a dictator are far more effective if the military power is apparent in the background.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten understand very well how interdependent the civil and the more military aspects of the CFSP are and, thus, how much they need each other as well. They have decided to work together very closely, as a result of which we will have a true Common Foreign and Security Policy far earlier than expected. We think that this cooperation can be very fruitful. Because even amongst ourselves, the dividing lines are fading in the light of significant problems and major humanitarian suffering which we are facing here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that Mr Solana will also be taking over the helm of the Western European Union, he will undoubtedly have a complex task ahead of him. How does he feel about the integration, in time, of the Western European Union into the European Union? How will he manage it? – reforming a military force of the Members and reinforcing the efficiency of the financial effort. Will the discussion regarding the Eurocorps, based in this city, increasingly focus on the Petersberg Tasks? For example, what changes are to be made to the German-Dutch army corps that is already functioning smoothly? Indeed, the traditional territorial defence tasks may no longer be sufficient here either. The corps in itself is an absolute gem because it is the only thing that actually works.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would invite Mr Solana to continue to give the necessary attention to former Yugoslavia. The European Union should emphatically demand that not only the minor but also the major war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, be arrested. It is in this sphere in particular that cooperation between the military and their policing task on the one hand, and civil policy on the other, is desperately needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Solana, a new office does not just mean a new office, but perhaps – as we all wish – a new policy also. You said that our Common Foreign and Security Policy must be more than just declarations. In this regard, I think you are absolutely right and endorse your view. However, you went further, and the next thing which you considered we need are military capabilities. I do not doubt that we also need military capabilities, but I shall leave it to my colleague, Mr Oostlander, to deal with the specifics of the corps.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress what Pierre Schori said previously: We need conflict prevention, which does not come about naturally. We must create structures so that conflict prevention is precisely that, leaving the corps and the military capabilities to one side, and perhaps even bringing a peaceful resolution to problems which arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, I say this with real conviction because I also, as soon as I hear of conflict or crisis, immediately think of the military. We must change this way of thinking. I ask you and invite you to work with Parliament to change this!</p>

<p class="contents">Now there are a significant number in my group from neutral and non-neutral countries alike who are actually very much against the whole idea of the creation of a European defence identity, and the debate within the neutral countries is being conducted in an extremely dishonest fashion. You yourself said that Monday was a historic occasion and that is true. It was a historic occasion. It was the first time that there was a formal meeting of defence ministers, and the decisions that were taken were historic. However, within the neutral states, the public is being misled. In fact, it is being brushed over as a non-event.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, our Foreign Minister said that he was quite happy with the decisions taken: he said that the interests of neutral countries were taken on board and that they were met within the opinion which was submitted by the EU Political Committee. In that opinion, it states that your role will be confined to what is set out in the Treaty on the European Union and also on the decisions taken at the European Council meeting in Cologne. That actually is quite a broad perspective and anything can happen within that.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Western European Union the issue of the mutual defence guarantee is even stronger than within NATO; within the neutral countries the general opinion at the moment is that the mutual defence commitment does not apply. But, I believe and many people within the neutral countries believe that when further decisions are taken, eventually the mutual defence commitment will be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that, as Commissioner Patten mentioned, this involves basically the whole issue of a European arms industry. His statement gives credence to our fears about the creation of a European arms industry. The St Malo Summit concluded that the EU needed, and I quote, ‘strengthened armed forces that can react rapidly to the new risks and which are supported by a strong and competitive European defence industry and technology’. There are many Member States within the European Union which are not involved in the arms industry and do not want to be involved in the arms industry. These decisions and discussions are not taking place at an honest level within the Member States, and especially within the neutral countries: the public is being misled.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, in this Parliament today, it was quite clear and most people were quite honest about it: they want a European defence identity, they want a competitive European arms industry and they want a European army; but the public in the Member States has not actually been consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in our common interest that they succeed as this will also be our success and in this we must support them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an indication that the new troika is finally starting to work. If I have understood things correctly, the Finnish Council Presidency has again sent the old troika to Russia. The new troika to which you both belong should also, in future, take on representation abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1990 and the collapse of bloc confrontation, it has once again become possible to carry out conventional wars at regional level in Europe, which in turn facilitate the old classic struggle between ethnic groups, border disputes and the like, the old circle of violence. We Europeans have not yet found an answer to this, as the former Yugoslavia shows. The efforts which are now being made in the common security and defence initiative are an attempt to find the European answer, specifically in terms of prevention. However, prevention, Mr Sakellariou, only works if it is backed by a credible military force. For this reason, the two must be tied together. Only then can prevention be genuinely implemented and I hope that it will work accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, through joint efforts, it will be possible to achieve synergetic effects in gathering troops to combat crises with the aim of bringing about a common armaments agency. We all know about the meagreness of the budgets and I think that with these synergetic effects the aim can be achieved. We should not do this with independent expensive structures but, as far as possible, in accordance with the NATO Resolution adopted at Berlin in 1996, in tandem with NATO and with the NATO structures. This seems to me to be an important route because it strengthens transatlantic ties whilst at the same time creating our own European capability where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my estimation, this would also mean that we will be able to carry out our duties jointly or separately, but not against our traditional partners. The European Union, with its common currency, common internal market and common legal system, has a common interest in also implementing a credible common security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also realise that this picture cannot exist indefinitely in areas where there are varying degrees of security. For this reason, at the Intergovernmental Conference, we should seek to make article 5 of the WEU Treaty a protocol of the EU Treaty to which each state can accede and, specifically, on the basis of an independent sovereign resolution. This means that none of the neutral or non-allied states would be compelled to accede. However, everything would then fall under the umbrella of credibility and common interests and we could further develop matters on this basis such that the appointment of Mr Solana as Secretary-General of the West European Union and the involvement of that Union could be fully effected without us needing to make allowance for article 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This all augurs well, and represents real progress. An equally good augury is given by the desire for mutual cooperation expressed by yourself and by Mr Patten, who has also just made some very rational statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address you in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, regarding security and defence policy. This means I have listened to you with the utmost concentration. In brief, today, permit me to stress the timetable or, to be more specific, the rate of the innovations and reforms which you are responsible for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovo crisis has made Europeans aware of the gaps in the political and military resources available to them. Furthermore, they have become more than ever aware of the risks they are running in letting a system continue which was designed at the time of the Cold War and which is no longer in any way suitable for the instances of instability which are proliferating around Europe and even within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This increased awareness provides an opportunity for innovation, as the Cologne Summit showed. But I am afraid that this window of opportunity may close again all too soon under the pressure of national conservatism and budgetary constraints. This is why my view is that things must get done quickly, as quickly as possible. Institutional reforms still need careful consideration, of course. It would be a mistake to rush. The same goes for the fundamental question of the respective roles of Europe and the United States. The solutions are not yet fully mature, but there are certainly already some practical steps which can be taken quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the enlargement of the General Affairs Council to include Defence Ministers, a formula which was already tested last Monday; setting up a permanent political body, “COPS”, responsible for monitoring all matters relating to common foreign and security policy, including defence; setting up a Military Committee; creating a rapid deployment task force of approximately 50,000 men, and so on and so forth. And I should take care not to forget the task which the Finnish Presidency, quite rightly, considered to be of great significance: improving our non-military security resources, particularly for preventive purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">All this may be achieved quickly on the lines of the guidelines established by the Fifteen. I think the old adage of testing the ground by walking on it would be particularly wise in this case, Mr Solana. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thankfully, it would now seem that we are learning our lessons. This week’s discussions at the General Affairs Council are to be warmly welcomed. The intention to place the reinforcement of European security and defence policy high on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council is an appropriate one. The positive approach of a traditionally neutral country such as Austria to these developments is to be applauded and I urge all other neutral Member States, including my own, to follow their lead. Needless to say, I disagree with my Irish colleague, Mrs McKenna, because I believe that the establishment of an EU defence policy is as much an essential prerequisite of genuine European integration as the single currency. If you subscribe to one, you should support the other. Allied to these exciting developments is the emergence of a Franco-British proposal to establish a force of 40,000 by 2003 to cover all Petersberg Tasks on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I welcome this proposal, I wish to see removed the ambiguity that has arisen in the wake of the remarks made by the British Defence Secretary, Geoffrey Hoon, namely is it a Franco-British force or an EU force? If the EU is to act as one in the future then the force must be an EU one with components from all Member States who wish to participate, and operating on the initiative and under the political control of the EU. I look forward to the Helsinki Council endorsing this vital principle and other elements which will strengthen the EU’s security and defence role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since he has taken office, the second pillar has been a hive of activity. The agenda is enormous. In actual fact, all EU political issues are dominated by foreign affairs and the Finnish Presidency is certainly taking great strides forwards. This is, in fact, worth two compliments if one considers the country’s historical neutrality. I would like to discuss European security policy and put a number of issues before Mr Solana, a number of questions which he may not be able to deal with today but which should be given priority in future, to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I back the EU’s ambitions in this field. The European security and defence identity should and shall emerge. I will not enlarge upon the military aspect, the structure and the capacity required, but I would like to be informed of the extent of the so-called Petersberg Tasks because the answer to this question will determine a great deal. Does the Union focus on minor or major crises? And if it focuses on minor crisis situations, what happens if a minor crisis escalates into a major one – because we all know that this is not unusual. According to the Washington Declaration, the European security and defence identity is open to all NATO countries. How does this relate to the EU’s ambition to be able to take unilateral decisions? What is to be done about the NATO countries which are not within the EU, namely Norway, Turkey and the three countries in Central and Eastern Europe? Many would like to know what will happen after your appointment as Secretary-General of the Western European Union. How can the WEU be fully integrated into the EU and what will then happen with the infamous article 5? Although some people in the Netherlands would like to take over the British role when it comes to desperately hanging on to the Atlantic relationship, and I mean the former British role, this is surely not comparable with the issues at large in neutral, non-aligned EU Member States regarding the European security and defence identity. I can respect this opinion. But how can such respect be compatible with a progressive agenda when it comes to the European security and defence identity? I know from my own experience that a broader approach to security and making conflict prevention a priority can be helpful here. The Union could make headway on this score by improving coordination between the first and second pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with a pertinent question. I think that we all, but also you, the Council and the Commission, should be concerned about how Parliament can monitor the system which we are developing. I would like to discuss within Parliament, but also with you, the way in which we could, from within this Parliament, but also from within national parliaments, better monitor the coming into being of the European security and defence identity and the further elaboration thereof. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – First of all let me thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for their statements. It seems to me that in all this discussion of European security, two elements – defence capabilities and institutional arrangements – have been confused and one seems hostage to the other. Of course we welcome any commitments by European states to modernise their armed forces in order to redress the present well-known deficiencies. As Mr Solana knows from his previous appointment, many Allied states do not even fulfil their force commitments to NATO. These issues are already being addressed by the Alliance as part of the defence capabilities initiative. The British armed forces are world class but they have been desperately over-stretched over the past year. I am not sure from where, therefore, the UK Government intends to find and sustain its contribution to some new European rapid deployment force that it has proposed, unless this is just smoke and mirrors, or at the expense of commitments to NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that legitimate concerns about military capabilities are not resolved by the Europeanisation of defence, which responds to an essentially political agenda and is an aspect of the process of European political integration. The danger is that there will be pressure for the EU to become the organisation of first resort when next there is a crisis to be dealt with and that NATO would increasingly be relegated to a purely residual role as a collective defence organisation. NATO’s vitality and transatlantic solidarity will only be maintained if NATO remains closely and constantly engaged in current crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as the Europeans are not proposing any additional forces, the capacity for EU autonomous action refers primarily to the political decision-making process. The key issue will be the interaction between the two centres of decision making, NATO and the EU, and the impact of this on the transatlantic relationship. Can we really afford strategically or financially duplicated staffs and committees, the proliferation of Euro forces and the wastefulness and confusion of subjecting our armed forces to two separate operational doctrines and planning regimes? Encumbering the European Union with defence responsibilities will do little to encourage it to make more effective use of its valuable non-military crisis-management instruments, which could genuinely complement the military forces of NATO. This is where the EU’s emphasis should be as Mr Patten has indicated. Improved military capabilities within the well-tried structures of NATO, not institutional geometry in Euro headquarters, are what is needed. The requirement, the objective is for greater security effectiveness with the Europeans and North Americans each contributing more proportionately. Our armies should not be recruited to the process of political integration, dressed up in other clothes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Kosovo showed us four things above all else. Firstly, that the European Union is capable of maintaining a common front during a crisis. Secondly, the excellent work of President Artisari shows that the EU can take decisive diplomatic action. Thirdly, it also shows us that NATO works well, and indeed works best, when the United States is focused and gives clear leadership. But also it shows that when that leadership is absent Europe has to be able to have the capacity to act to preserve the security of its own continent. And, fourthly, it showed us that, despite the fact that we spend 70% of what the Americans spend on defence, we are almost entirely dependent on American equipment because we have something like 10% of their capacity. And part of that reason of course is that much of our military is based on the cold war principles of static defence and not the modern principles of rapid reaction. Unless we address that question then the whole issue of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and a European defence identity is no more than a day-dream.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I welcome what has been said today, but I do have some questions and, unusually for these sorts of debates, I would actually like some answers. Does Mr Solana agree with me that what we need primarily is a European defence review to assess our capacities? Does he agree with me that conscription is incompatible with a modern mobile force? Does he agree with me that we need to have a Council of Defence Ministers if we are to address these questions? And does he agree with me that we need to have convergence of defence expenditure by Member States? He also addressed the question of non-EU NATO members. Is he saying, as I think he is, that Turkey is vital to the success of the European defence initiative and we should take that into account?</p>
<p class="contents">And to Mr Patten may I say I welcome what he said about armaments but will the Commission be following up its previous communications with decisive action in this field and does he agree with me that the Meteor Missile project is crucial to the future of a European defence industry? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And within this framework you have taken on the important task of personifying the joint effort to put in place a foreign and security policy which concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">As you reminded us the other day in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, you are at the other end of that telephone which Kissinger spoke of. And please be assured that, in your task, you can count on the stimulus and support of this House and my group in particular. I am convinced that you will not disappoint us.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I am confident that you will make every effort to ensure that our foreign policy will respond to balanced criteria, which will, without doubt, confirm that you give priority to the political and economic convergence of all those countries which, like Spain, almost 25 years ago, are moving from an autocratic regime to a liberal regime and that you will ensure that peace will always reign on European soil. I am also sure that you will guarantee our prominent role throughout the Mediterranean region, another priority both in economic and in security terms, and that we will effectively safeguard our interests in Latin America, for example by ensuring compliance with the commitment made with the United States Government with regard to the application of the Helms-Burton law. I am surprised that Mr Solana did not mention it this morning, although I have no doubt whatsoever concerning his convictions in that regard. In any event, we wish him every success in his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also conjecture that a leader of a European country went to Belgrade to see Milosevic. What would your comments be on these two events?</p>
<p class="contents">I am raising this issue not to make things difficult for you, because we do not carry out foreign policy based on conjecture, but to illustrate the context in which you should operate. You must not walk on a tightrope because, as we all know, tightrope-walkers are doomed to fall one day. There are two strategies before us. The first is for preventing tension and the second is for managing tension and crises whenever they arise. The latter involves a Europe which is politically absent but economically present; it is a strategy for simply monitoring crises, which leads nowhere. The former is a strategy for Europe and for peace, security and economic development. Fifty years on, we once again witnessed war on Europe’s doorstep with the recent crisis in Yugoslavia. It was a mistake with indeterminable repercussions. </p>
<p class="contents">Now we are confronted with a new phase of developments and hostilities in the Caucasus region. I believe that there is a golden opportunity for you now in the Caucasus to prove yourself as a true Prometheus and not an Epimetheus. You are probably familiar with the Ancient Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and the story “Prometheus Bound” which took place in the Caucasus region where Zeus punished Prometheus and tied him up in chains as punishment for stealing fire from the thunderbolt and giving it to Man. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr Solana, that you will, in any case, be a Prometheus, both in the Caucasus and in your forthcoming term of office, as that will serve the interests of Europe, of democracy and of human rights. Once again, I wish you every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But please allow me first of all to thank all those Members of the various parliamentary groups who have chosen to speak and have wished me, and wished us, luck in this enterprise. I can tell you that I will put all my commitment, all my energy and all my political experience into making a great success of this enterprise, in cooperation with all the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as some speakers have expressed so clearly, the Europe that is moving into the 21st century is much better than the Europe that many of us dreamt of and it still perhaps has a journey to make for those of us who are dreamers. We are without doubt succeeding with the common currency, we have made progress in the economic field and the moment has come to make progress in the political field, and specifically in the field of foreign and security policy. And in this direction and in this effort you will find that I am working with you.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three points in an attempt to deal collectively with the many questions you have put to me: firstly, foreign policy in the strict sense. After the Cologne Summit, we now have new instruments – one relates to common strategies – which must, without any doubt whatsoever, lead to a profound change in the way we approach foreign policy. Common strategies – some of which are already defined – must mean the pooling of all the Union’s and the Member States’ capacities in order to implement a policy. This has not happened before now. This has come about as a result of the decisions taken in Cologne and, specifically, it has happened in the common strategy with regard to Russia. That must be our centre of gravity in terms of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question I wanted to refer to – because many of you have raised this concern – is the concern regarding the management and prevention of crises. I would like to say that I agree totally – and this was best expressed in the clear intervention by Mr Pierre Schori – that we do not only have to put an end to crises, but we should prevent them from the outset. That is what we are trying to do. The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an early warning unit whose objective is to be attentive to what may happen so that we can prevent it happening and not have to act either militarily nor collectively if we are able to do everything possible by diplomatic means or by preventive means.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to share with you a very sad personal experience of mine. When we began to take action on the Bosnia crisis we developed a military plan involving the deployment of troops – remember that 60,000 troops were deployed in Bosnia – which came a long time before the civil plan which we should have implemented. That difference in momentum between the two plans had consequences which many of us regret to this day and which I personally regret.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in line with what we have noted, any crisis management or peace-keeping operation to be planned according to a global view of its civil, police and military aspects. In this way we would be in a better situation in Kosovo now and, before that, in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally I would like to make a brief comment on the current issue which has been addressed – and I imagine this will be of interest to you. This afternoon or tomorrow morning an important meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe begins. The honourable representative of the left group said that the OSCE must continue to be at the heart of pan-European security. And he also said this in relation to the crisis in Chechnya. In the hours to come we have a wonderful opportunity to try to make the OSCE into an important organisation and, at the same time, to persuade the Russian authorities to allow Europe to play a role which, up till now, it has not been allowed to play. There is a degree of contradiction on the part of the Russian authorities who show the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe the greatest affection – so to speak – and at the same time do not allow it to play its rightful role. I can tell you that, on the part of the European Union, tomorrow and the day after, we will do everything possible to enable the OSCE to play an important role, in accordance with its obligations, at a time when a new charter on security in Europe is about to be signed. It would be really absurd if, just as we are about to sign a new collective charter on security in Europe through the OSCE, that organisation is not able to do what it has to do in the conflict which is now taking place in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a good number of questions and it would take too long to answer them all one by one. I can tell you that I have taken note of all of them, that I will answer all of them promptly, and that, as I said at the beginning, I will be available to you at all times to try to realise our common dream. Thank you for your support and your cooperation. We will be in contact over the coming months and years to enable us to make a success of this noble endeavour which we are all taking on with great enthusiasm.</p>
