<p class="contents">To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent. However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today. Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010. We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution. In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions. I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems. The public must have a right to clean water. It is important not only for the environment but also for public health. I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality. Action must get under way immediately. We cannot afford to waste time. It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one. In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should look a little more closely at some points. For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters. I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent. But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind. I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management. Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right. The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.</p>
<p class="contents">We have three outstanding problems. The first is the transfer of water between basin areas. That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas. Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless. Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic. Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero – in English, that is quite a meaningless term. We need to look very carefully at those. The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky. Scotch whisky – especially malt whisky, which is the best – requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream. Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk. We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water. That is my third request – that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive represents both a point of arrival and a point of departure. It is a point of arrival because it was developed from a range of directives which were fragmentary and diffuse, and applies a unified logic and systematic consistency to water legislation. It is also a point of departure because a new framework of reference has been created, into which future European legislation on water will converge and flow.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The framework directive seeks to be, and rightly so, both ambitious and realistic, both strong-minded and carefully thought out, and it has, to a large extent, succeeded. Thanks to Mrs Lienemann’s excellent work, the amendments proposed by the Commission will go some way towards strengthening the directive’s text and making it more rigorous. Making it more rigorous does not mean making it more rigid, by ignoring the stark differences in climate and geography across Europe. The rapporteur’s proposal is one which, on the whole, I would wish to support but I would like to express some praise for it and then two concerns. I would first of all like to praise it because the directive’s demand for the integrated management of water basins is undeniably a step forward. This also applies to the demand that water only be transferred between basins when this is shown to be absolutely necessary. This is a principle that will prove beneficial and instructive for the Iberian Peninsula for example.</p>
<p class="contents">My first concern is about the timetable laid down in the directive: it may prove to be a straitjacket although I think that it also represents a powerful challenge. My second concern is easy to guess: it turns on the difficulties in establishing water charges and in setting prices, particularly when taking environmental costs into account. This is something that causes anxiety, particularly among farmers. Paying a fair price for water may also result in injustices.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This framework directive banks on a considerable gamble: that in 2020 European waters will have returned to their natural state, free of pollution and dangerous substances. Is this a Utopian ideal? Is this a return to pre-industrial society? I think not. I give this framework directive my vote of confidence and of optimism. The recent catastrophe on the Danube has illustrated, as in a nightmare, that a long-term policy and strategy for the ecological protection of our water, however much it may cost, is not a luxury of the rich but a necessity for civilisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation. We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates. In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos. River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the Council’s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery. Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive’s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future. We are all entitled to clean drinking water. I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann’s work on this matter. It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann’s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position. Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones. </p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years. I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position. And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement. In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate. Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero. If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020. I think that Mrs Lienemann’s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today’s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement. First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act. The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come. The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU. The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater. In Finland surface waters are very clean. The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves. The process does not require a chemical sewage plant. The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Deviating from the Council’s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water. This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed. The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts. The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view. I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way. There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive. In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it. However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers. In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage. The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it. As for the time scale demanded for the directive’s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive’s implementation will take time and considerable resources. In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted. I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State’s territory against its will. And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment – gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members – and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow. It is all about making it clear that water – and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today – is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it. </p>
<p class="contents">I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water. I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way. This applies to every country. But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist. In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant. It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of. This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55°C or 60°C in the sun.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission. In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas. That is how the common position has been worded.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said with regard to transfers. Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact. It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs. Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a framework for the protection and management of our water – surface, ground, transitional and coastal – through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments. A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable. We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level. However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly. The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977. Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU. Water is a scarce and precious natural resource. Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges. That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.</p>
<p class="contents">If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.</p>
<p class="contents">All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance. I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These include, for example, costs and transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about. Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water? Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks? Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services? Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs? All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas. Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe? They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale. One of the most significant transfers – the Tajo-Segura transfer – which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year. The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200. We cannot be accused of bad management.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation? We are not doing a bad job of management. We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive. Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions. I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.</p>

Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said. An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe. Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office. </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament. Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading. </p>
<p class="contents">Most of Parliament’s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious. The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary. With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments. We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention. Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature. This is also reflected in many of Parliament’s amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe’s water policy for the next three decades. It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way. It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge. But water is <span class="italic">not</span> free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge. It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances. </p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed. I just want to emphasise this further. It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them. This is also expressed in Recital 14. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again. We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail. Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives. I am glad to see that Parliament’s amendments have focused upon this. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text. We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content. As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character. It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable. It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables. I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR. The Commission’s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed. Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission’s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed. This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved. The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved. Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances. I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector. The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive. </p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services. I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way. I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs. I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector. This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured. I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission’s original proposal. I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources. </p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals. This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution. We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question. </p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament that the common position’s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced. The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction. This proposal can therefore be approved. A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided. The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water. This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found. </p>
<p class="contents">To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important area is protection of the groundwater. We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution. We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. </p>
<p class="contents">The most important parts of Parliament’s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater. The proposal cannot therefore be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality. Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area. The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled. This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appreciates Parliament’s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role. This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47. In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a <span class="italic">de minimis</span> provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved. It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted. The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views. Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions. A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of. Parliament’s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades. </p>
