<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – This Parliament and, for what it is worth, this Commissioner, have been long-standing opponents of the death penalty. Speaking for myself, I voted consistently against it when I was a member of another parliament. One of the first decisions that I took when I was Governor of Hong Kong, with the support of organisations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, was to take the death penalty off the statute book of Hong Kong and I am delighted that it remains off the statute book.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has declared in the past that it considers capital punishment an inhuman, medieval form of punishment and unworthy of modern societies. I know that many people would echo that sentiment. I am pleased that all Central and Eastern European countries which are candidates for membership of the Union have abolished the death penalty. We are moving towards a Europe in which the death penalty is outlawed continent-wide. The European Union is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances and has agreed to campaign for its universal abolition. That stance is rooted in our belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and in the inviolability of the human person. In my case, my opposition to the death penalty is also rooted in my belief in the sanctity of human life.</p>
<p class="contents">Some 87 states retain the death penalty and about 30 carry out executions in any given year. One or two states carry out executions in industrial quantities. The European Union has been for some time now actively seeking a global moratorium. The Union has defined a set of guidelines for identifying circumstances in which the European Union can take specific, targeted action. These guidelines specify that the European Union will encourage states to accede to the second optional protocol of the Convention on Civil and Political Rights and comparable regional mechanisms aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. We will also raise the issue of the death penalty in multilateral forums.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union shares the deep concern of all those opposed to the death penalty, that it is impossible to reduce to zero the risk of applying the penalty in error. That risk, the risk of taking innocent life, is reason enough in the view of many of us to outlaw it as a punishment. Nor do we accept the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to violent crime since in our countries the evidence simply does not support that claim.</p>
<p class="contents">In countries which maintain the death penalty, the European Union aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and respect for the strict conditions set out in several international human rights instruments under which capital punishment may be used, as well as at the establishment of a moratorium on executions, so as to eliminate completely the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">During the presidencies of Finland and Portugal, the European Union raised the issue of the death penalty with a host of countries including the authorities in Antigua and Barbuda, Burundi, the Bahamas, China, Guyana, India, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Uzbekistan, the Yemen and Zimbabwe. In the case of China, we used the forum of our dialogue on human rights to press the issue time and again. I regret that China continues to make almost daily use of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is especially concerned about the imposition of the death penalty on young people below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime. The European approach to juvenile justice is consistent with internationally recognised juvenile justice standards as enshrined in the international human rights instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I said at the outset that the European Union had decided to raise the issue of the death penalty in multilateral fora. This has not always been simple. The House will recall that following intensive negotiation, we decided at last year's UN General Assembly in November that no resolution was better than a fatally flawed text and that therefore the European Union should not pursue its initiative in the United Nations General Assembly. This April's UN Commission on Human Rights resolution was, however, adopted with a clear majority, I am extremely pleased to say. It would seem that while the hard-line retentionists are resigned to further Commission on Human Rights texts on this issue, they will continue to resist strongly any efforts to secure a General Assembly resolution. This would lead to further divisive debate. As a result the European Union has decided that it would not be either advisable or timely to table a resolution on the death penalty at UNGA 55.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime we continue to support campaigns designed to achieve a moratorium on the death penalty and executions, and eventually the abolition of capital punishment throughout the world. We do so under the budget lines that fall under the chapter "European initiative for democracy and human rights". In particular under budget line B7-704 we are pursuing a number of initiatives throughout the world designed to mobilise public opinion against the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 a joint programme was established between the Commission and the Council of Europe to raise public awareness about various themes related to the abolition of the death penalty in Russia, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine. The programme, worth over EUR 670 000 over two years, will provide information to parliamentarians, to legal experts and to the general public on the penal policy arguments against capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat, this is a subject we take seriously. It is a subject which I personally take extremely seriously. We speak on it as a Union with a degree of moral authority. We are making progress. But it will take time and persistence as well as the continued advocacy of this Parliament if we are to attain one day our goal, which is to see the death penalty consigned to the history books as a form of punishment which has absolutely no place in the modern world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said so well on many occasions, Parliament, and with it the Group of the European People's Party, has declared itself against the death penalty and in favour of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, the sole objective of which is to achieve the definitive abolition of the death penalty throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It could not be otherwise, given that this practice, which is directly connected with respect for human life, runs contrary to the defence of human rights, the first of which, the basis and foundation for all the others, is the right to life, which is promoted by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There comes a time, however, when words are not enough and a far more aggressive attitude must be adopted in defence of what, for the Christian Democrats, constitutes the very core of our philosophy and our political action: the transcendental value of the person and the right to life from the moment of conception until their natural death; two principles which are incompatible with the application of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are not only advocating its abolition, but also proposing the possibility of using budget lines intended for human rights to campaign in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty, and that non-governmental organisations, both international and local, and religious authorities may also participate in the implementation of these budget lines.</p>
<p class="contents">And we propose this, first of all, because human rights and the abolition of the death penalty constitute a whole and because this enables us to move from words to action, and because the participation of civil society is essential to creating a mindset and a collective awareness in favour of abolishing the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there is a tendency in favour of abolishing the death penalty. We need only look at the statistics. Nonetheless, it is still applied in 90 States and we cannot turn a blind eye to the 1,625 known executions carried out in 1998, 80% of which took place in just four countries, including, in third place, the United States of America with 68 executions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, together with respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty must be a key element, Commissioner, in relations between the European Union and third countries. This is particularly so in the case of the United States due to the contradiction inherent in championing freedom throughout the world and having the power of life or death over its citizens, be it in order to set an example or because a majority of citizens requests it.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy cannot subject everything to the law of numbers as no action affecting the fundamental rights of the person, the first and foremost of which is the right to life, can be undertaken or justified in the name of the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">If the death penalty – as the community of San Egidio told us – dehumanises our world by giving primacy to reprisals and revenge, then placing all measures, both economic and political, within our reach in order to banish a practice that is contrary to the principles and values that constitute our raison d'être should be a priority objective for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased that the Commission has adopted this objective and that it is being treated with the degree of gravity that the Commissioner told us this fundamental issue deserves, so that we might be in harmony with the principles we are defending.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Díez González (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, once again Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of human dignity and against the death penalty. But on this occasion it has done so following the approval by the Convention of the definitive text of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This Charter actually devotes its first chapter to human dignity, stating that it is inviolable and will be respected and protected. It also states that nobody can be condemned to the death penalty or executed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has spoken in favour of the Charter being incorporated into the Treaties and these rights of European citizens being applied to citizens of third countries. However, it is more relevant than ever for us to ask ourselves whether it is time to demand that the Commission and the Council incorporate the abolition of the death penalty as a clause respecting human rights into negotiations with all third countries, not only those waiting in line to become part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">1999 was another bad year. According to Amnesty International, almost 2000 people were executed and in 63 countries 4000 others were condemned to death. China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States are some of the 31 countries in which executions took place. Did you know that in this last country, in the United States, that great upholder of democratic fundamentals – as Concepció Ferrer was saying just now – 98 citizens were executed in 1999? Did you know that in 18 North-American states it is possible to execute a sixteen-year-old? Did you know that in that same country, since 1976, 34 mentally-retarded offenders have been executed? I draw attention to the United States, not because I am anti-American, which I am not, but because we are talking about a democracy with which we are on good terms, which watches over the interests of peace and democracy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us all to ask ourselves whether we can do more. It is time we understood that humanitarian declarations alone are not enough. I believe that if we do not turn this fight into a political commitment, with a capital P, as a fundamental part of European foreign policy – and that is why I am pleased that Commissioner Patten is here – we will be doing less than we could to prevent this barbarism. Let us do all we can from within this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember the words of Albert Camus: “There will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed”. And another thing, Mr Patten, you were saying in your speech that we cannot guarantee zero error in executions. Every execution is an error. I am agnostic, but I read the Bible and it says that nobody should touch Cain in spite of the fact that he killed his brother Abel. Every execution is an error that democracy, the defence of human rights and human dignity cannot accept.</p>

<p class="contents">When our international institutions, when the AJA Tribunal is faced with the sentence inflicted on the criminal Tadic – who is guilty of heinous crimes – and we compare these appalling crimes with any of the incidents in any countries, including democratic countries, as a result of which thousands of people are now waiting on death row, we may be able to appreciate the fact that what had been a purely European characteristic, that is the rejection of capital punishment, may – in political time, not historical time – spread until it becomes the clearly predominant political, institutional and humanitarian <span class="italic">modus</span> <span class="italic">operandi</span> throughout the world. This is the inspiration behind the new Europe of the start of the third millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is why it is necessary for the Commission – and I would ask Commissioner Patten to give an incisive response – to make good use of these amendments to the European Union's budget that were tabled by our Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party in respect of the 2000 budget. Indeed, there can be no institutional initiative in this field without close cooperation with non-governmental organisations. I therefore propose, Commissioner, that you consider the possibility of Europe establishing a European Day of protest against the death penalty: this would make a substantial contribution to generating a universal consciousness from that cradle of civilisation which Europe is and wishes to remain.</p>

<p class="contents">It was on 10 March 1992 that Mrs Adelaide Aglietta presented the first major report to the European Parliament calling for a moratorium on executions, to be decided upon by the UN. 8 years on, as our resolution also highlights, the situation is serious and gives cause for concern, but international interest in the moratorium is constantly on the rise. We must take this as a fresh starting point, despite the recent lull in UN activity and, for this reason, we must make good use of the resources available under the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, a moratorium would not have been able to prevent the 4 000 arbitrary<span class="bold"> </span>executions which have taken place in recent years in Iraq or the thousands of executions which have taken place in China, but in other countries, especially the United States, the only great democracy still to exercise the death penalty with stubborn pride, this long labouring to mobilise public opinion to call for a moratorium is having some, very slight, effect. Mr Bush, in whose State 144 executions have been carried out, succeeded in removing the issue of the death penalty from the electoral campaign and discreetly and hypocritically postponed the executions in his State until after the elections. Might this not be yet more proof of the cynical manipulation of people's lives – even though they are often guilty, of course – as a cynical political move? This is why we must continue along this road with the same conviction and tenacity that Mrs Aglietta had when she founded the association 'Hands Off Cain'. We may not get there immediately but we are confident that, with the available funds from the budget and the assistance of the Commission, we will succeed in achieving this objective.</p>

All the Member States of the United Nations have committed themselves to respect that declaration. The death penalty irrevocably<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>violates the right to life and is inevitably cruel, inhumane and humiliating. In the year 2000 alone, 70 people have been executed in the USA. There is a long list of countries in which the death penalty is carried out or in which death sentences are imposed, such as China, Iran and Iraq. Although no death penalties have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, over 69 people have been sentenced to death. The Turkish Parliament has the final word on carrying out this sentence and has 49 cases to deal with. This is unacceptable for a state which is seeking membership of the European Union. Turkey must abolish the death penalty if it is to be accepted into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have a death penalty? Since the death penalty has existed, people have unsuccessfully tried to justify the need for it. Nowadays, supporters of the death penalty chiefly use the argument that it acts as a deterrent. They maintain that the number of serious offences rises when the death penalty is abolished. There is not the least evidence of this anywhere in the world. For example, how can you explain that the murder rate in the USA, where the death penalty still exists, is considerably higher than in countries where it has been abolished? There is always the risk of an innocent person being executed – there have already been many cases in which innocent people have been sentenced to death. In particular, the death penalty is applied relatively often to the disadvantaged and to minorities. The underlying principle of the death penalty is revenge, which is inappropriate in a civilised state.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it is Abu-Jamal in the USA, Öçalan in Turkey or even the execution of Abdul Achmin Sabi<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>in Iraq – we should condemn all of this. I regard the death sentence as a barbaric ...</p>

<p class="contents">We are also aware of how difficult it is to succeed in eliminating this penalty which is so very unnatural and inhumane. It is even difficult in America where, as Mrs Frassoni pointed out, those who represent the institutions, the policy-makers, do not dare to propose abolishing capital punishment for fear of losing support. The reason is clear: with the rise in organised crime the death penalty is considered to be a deterrent, containing and checking the increase in crime and illegal activity. However, we know that this is not at all the case; we know that the death penalty is an abhorrent practice, a form of State-legalised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that, even though it is strict and uncompromising, the fight against crime must be pursued under the banner of the law and social rehabilitation, certainly not in the name of repression alone or, what is even worse, with the mentality of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is precisely why we must promote a Europe-wide campaign for a moratorium on the death penalty, a large-scale human rights campaign which involves everybody, from those with political or institutional roles to the citizens themselves, especially the younger citizens, precisely in order to create genuine civil awareness of the matter and to put political pressure on the countries in which the death penalty is still part of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to propose that the European States refuse to trade with those countries in which the death penalty is still practised, but I know that this is nothing but a utopian dream. I refer, in particular, to China, which, as the Commissioner too mentioned, issues a death sentence every day of the week and in general shows very little respect for human rights but which, regrettably, is also a highly attractive trading partner for all the European countries and one they cannot do without.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that these campaigns against the death penalty would be much more efficient and much more widespread if we were to succeed, as an institution, in conveying to our citizens the idea that we are simultaneously working, with equal determination and efficiency to build a safe Europe where it will be possible to eradicate terrible criminal scourges, such as drug trafficking, the exploitation of human beings and child abuse, in the very near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is to her that we owe the start of this lengthy undertaking in 1992, the start of this interminable battle in which we are still engaged. And it is precisely with a view to the past, when I look at the progress made since 1992, Commissioner, that I cannot share your positive reaction to the Union's withdrawal of its support from the resolution presented in November at the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am convinced that this was an opportunity missed and that, due to the issue of the inflexibility of the<span class="bold"> </span>wording<span class="bold">,</span> which prevented a compromise being reached on the preamble – I repeat, on the preamble, nothing to do with the body of the text at all – we were actually in danger of losing sight of the crux of the matter and ended up dancing to the tune of a whole range of powerful countries, some well-disposed towards the project and others not so well-disposed, or of great markets whose noses were most certainly put out of joint by this initiative. This is nothing new – Europe was divided as early as 1994 over the motion for a resolution presented by Italy – but for this very reason it is all the more serious, for the eight years of work put in not only by Parliament but by your staff, I am sure, Commissioner, and the Union as such, could have resulted in a victory last November. There is no doubt that victory would have been possible. I repeat, in my opinion, we missed a major opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Commissioner, I feel that, precisely on this type of subject, working in conjunction with organisations which operate in society or with non-governmental organisations is a key factor, for these organisations usually have greater room for manoeuvre, and are able to be bolder and uphold positions which are, so to speak, less influenced by other considerations or interests, in themselves legitimate but all too often liable to lead governments and institutions to compromise and assume less forthright positions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely why part of the resolution calls upon the Commission to be more explicit in its report and in providing transparent information on the use of the year 2000 budget lines relating to this matter and to democratisation in general. It has, in fact, happened in the past and still happens that the very organisations which have put most work into this matter have, so to speak, been excluded from working with the Commission on a project, even though they have been doing so for many years because, it appears, there is no more funding and we do not know exactly where it has gone. That is why, Commissioner, I feel that transparency and the provision of information would benefit a joint project which, I feel sure, is of interest to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the moment – as it has been said – the images of the American electoral campaign and the final debate between the two main candidates are fresh in our minds; a debate in which the candidate for the Democrats stated publicly that the only thing he had in common with his opponent was being in favour of the death penalty. I think it is important for the European Union to head the campaign to abolish the death penalty, given that it is a campaign in favour of human dignity and the most basic of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe – and you expressed this very well – that when developing the European Union’s external affairs policy we must consider, with regard to the third countries, that there is already a declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam which clearly reflects that to be eligible for membership of the European Union, candidate states must have abolished the death penalty. But, I insist, in relations with third countries we must be extremely clear and firmly promote relations with those countries that share our views on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner – Mrs Ferrer expressed this very well a moment ago – sometimes we need to move on from beatitudes to balance sheets and we must therefore support the Commission's action with adequate programming, effective action and, in particular, visible, clear, transparent action by the European Union with the participation – as Mrs Bonino stated – of the non-governmental organisations, which have a lot to say and contribute from this point of view.</p>

Regrettably, however, this has never been the case and it is not so now. We must avoid turning our reasoning and indignant declarations into a wake because, while we are expressing our indignation, executions are still being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what we want from Parliament, the Commission and the Council too is sound pragmatism: we must endeavour to understand how we can be effective, how we can tip the balance so that the death penalty ceases to disgrace the whole of humanity. This is what the resolution is trying to say.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points which we consider to be of basic practical concern. Firstly, the abolition of the death penalty or a moratorium must continue to be an inalienable priority in our relations with third countries, not a condition for friendship but a condition for political, commercial and economic cooperation. The second point – which you raised, Commissioner, and which, I am happy to say, was taken up by many of the Members – is that the Commission must exercise great care in allocating its financial resources in order to support campaigns which are able to alter the public perception of the death penalty. As Mr Salafranca pointed out, there was a rather embarrassing moment in the debate for the US presidential elections when both the candidates for the Presidency of the United States declared that they were in favour of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the children of Cesare Beccaria: we do not want our heritage to be confined within the borders of Europe. Therefore, we need actions in support of non-governmental organisations, in support of civil society, in support too of those who have proved that they have the enormous amount of courage necessary to invest in this area, as Mrs Bonino mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Commissioner by calling for the highest possible degree of pragmatism from the Commission; I call upon the Council to give voice to our governments; I call upon Parliament to be courageous enough never to fall silent on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredible and horrific that this should still be happening in the year 2000. As has also been said by other MEPs in this Chamber – most of whom have been Italian, though I do not believe that that is really significant, given the disgust we all feel – it is an unworthy punishment: a punishment unworthy of a civilised society, which always involves a risk of innocent people being convicted.</p>
<p class="contents">China tops the list when it comes to the death penalty, and I and other Members of this Chamber have often made a point of condemning China. Today, I thought, however, of concentrating on the United States. There is a presidential election in the United States in two weeks’ time, and the next president may be George Bush, a person who has signed 145 people’s execution warrants. There have been legal doubts concerning a number of the cases, and there have also been a number of cases concerning children. In at least one of these cases, the child concerned was mentally handicapped. It is abominable and shameful, and it seriously damages the United States’s reputation as a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With the presidential election in mind, it is incredibly important that we should express our disgust in this Chamber.

Your stand today on capital punishment goes beyond noble intent.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the year 2000 budget lines aimed at financing campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty. So far so good. But the shadow is still there. Let me come to the point, Commissioner Patten. The EUR 700 000 invested by the Commission went mainly to Penal Reform International, a legal organisation which operates in the Caribbean islands, and to the University of Westminster, which provides a database and research for lawyers in study centres in the Philippines. So I urge the Commission to focus and extend the use of the assistance funds to the two main nations where state murder is practised with no restraint and with great relish: the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. Yes, we know the issue has been raised ritually and periodically with the governments of both countries, but we have to do much more. For instance, as regards the United States, some of this money should be invested in sensibilisation campaigns in Europe, certainly not in order to boycott a sovereign state like Texas, but to re-route European tourism and European industrial investment to those 12 states that do not indulge in such a barbaric practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a world of difference between the implementation of the death penalty in, for example, the United States on the one hand, and in countries such as China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea – to name but a few of a long list – on the other. In the first case, we are talking about the highest penalty for extremely dangerous criminals who, moreover, have been able to avail themselves of very many defence mechanisms in the democratic court procedures. In the other cases, the death penalty is often a kind of random and horrifying tool of intimidation used by no means only against dangerous criminals under common law. Anyone who lumps all of this together is clearly deluding himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have to say that it is easy to shed crocodile tears over the fate of dangerous criminals in democratic states. It is somewhat more difficult to take pity on those left behind, for example old people who are tortured to death for their savings, badly paid money couriers who are shot dead by gangsters in a heartless act, or children who are raped and killed. If I were convinced that in Europe, there is the will to look after the fate of victims and the safety of victims, I, along with you, would condemn the death penalty here today without any reservation. I can only establish that in practice, certainly in my country, extremely dangerous criminals are systematically set free early and it is not unusual for them to commit horrific crimes again. It is in those circumstances not surprising that many people say that the death penalty for some monsters who have offended again and again could have saved numerous innocent lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gargani (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this debate, which is a repeat of other, previous debates would, on the surface, appear superfluous and outdated. A debate on the death penalty is a debate which harks back to the development of a civilised legal system, which is something Europe already has. And yet it is topical and important in terms of world affairs. It is important for the Parliament of Europe – of Western Europe – to treat it as such since two traditions have evolved in Europe over the millennium: one which derives from the Roman tradition which influenced the European legal culture, particularly that of Italy and Germany, and recently paved the way for the new rights to freedoms, and then the tradition of Common Law, which is a basic part of the British Bill of Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite certain very tragic events which have taken place in Europe, despite the fact that there have been fascist and communist cultures that have trampled underfoot rights to freedoms and the rights of individuals, I feel it noteworthy that agreement has been reached time and time again in this Parliament in discussing the death penalty and firmly condemning it in any form whatsoever. In my opinion, the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is under discussion, for which Nice will be a decisive moment, is based on this value, the value of the human person, the value of the right to freedom. We Italians are of the tradition of Cesare Beccaria, as has already been said, but Beccaria was a man who belonged to Europe, who rejected mediaeval, obscurantist law in its entirety in favour of modern law, in favour of a legal system which does not make us wolves to our fellow men but, by means of peaceful civil coexistence, guarantees freedoms. Capital punishment is always incompatible with peace in civil coexistence and we must find the courage to declare that accepting a moratorium – although that would be great step forward – is not enough to make a country genuinely democratic: to achieve true democracy it must abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">And so it is true: a humanitarian undertaking is not sufficient. We need to shout it from the rooftops that the death penalty is against the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, correct that the European Union does not permit the death penalty within its borders. The death penalty is the cruellest, most inhumane and degrading penalty. It violates the right to life, is irrevocable and can involve innocent people. Furthermore, it has never been proven that it is a better deterrent against crime than any other kind of penalty. It was stated a moment ago that in the United States, there might be a better legal procedure or that very serious crimes are sometimes committed there. But that is exactly the point. We, as government, cannot afford to stoop to the level of the criminals we punish. That is precisely the civilisation which we have achieved here in Europe and that is the civilisation which we must hold on to. We therefore give our warm support to Commissioner Patten’s policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what I was saying in this House back in October of last year, when mobilisation was urgently called for to prevent the black American journalist, Mumia Abu Jamal, being executed.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the position today? A total of 77 states still see the death penalty as the appropriate response to certain crimes. In 1999, 1813 people were executed in 31 countries and there are at least 3 857 people condemned to death in 63 countries. The life of Mumia, who is waiting for a possible review of his trial, is, more than ever, hanging by the thread of international solidarity. So what approach is the European Union going to adopt to ensure that the death penalty disappears before the end of the century? During phase 2 of his life on death row, Mumia Abu Jamal sent this courageous message: ‘Phase 2 is the second phase of the fight. We will win’.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, encouraging signs bear witness to the rising abolitionist trend at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the European Parliament, the United Nations is now participating in the inevitable debate that is taking place across all levels of society. In the United States, opinion is still very much in favour of capital punishment, but its hold has been shaken. A study by the University of Columbia brought to light an almost 60% rate of errors committed in twenty years in the executions that were carried out. Innocent people are being killed and racism is evident in the application of the death penalty. The residence of the governor of Texas and the Republican candidate for the White House is regularly the target of demonstrations by opponents of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must put its full weight behind achieving this moratorium and imposing it as an inviolable principle on all nations still practising this form of state-sanctioned murder which, as Victor Hugo declared, ‘traumatises the human conscience’. Nineteen years after the abolition of the death penalty in France, initiatives are currently being taken in favour of a national day for the institution of a universal moratorium on capital executions. And I am in favour of this proposal being advanced at a European level. On 10 December, hundreds of thousands of petitions will be handed in to the United Nations. The Presidency of the European Union could also join this campaign, thereby giving inspiration and crucial backing to those who are fighting for abolition. The mobilisation of Europe is critical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not want to get into competitive humanitarianism, but I feel as passionately about this subject as any Member in Parliament and I have spoken in debates about this subject as often as anyone in Parliament, indeed I suspect I have probably spoken in more debates than some people in Parliament. I have spoken in debates at university when I was a student. I have spoken in debates at universities subsequently in my political career. I have spoken on radio and television programmes. I have been booed for what I have said at public meetings on capital punishment. I have spoken in Parliament about capital punishment. I have spoken in Parliament during highly charged debates on terrorism, on terrorist acts and capital punishment, against the use of capital punishment. This is in my experience a completely unique debate. I have never taken part in a debate on capital punishment where everyone was on the same side and that is a point worth reflecting on.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable lady in an extremely good and moving speech referred to the Bible and referred to Cain and Abel. The Bible has been more misused in these debates – and I am not suggesting the honourable lady was misusing it – than most other texts except perhaps for Confucius. Usually we hear the Bible quoted in another way. We hear that verse about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. That is usually the text which is quoted so it was admirable to hear the honourable lady going back even further to Genesis. And you cannot get much earlier than that. I just ask Parliament to reflect on the fact that this debate included speeches all of which were on the same side – a side with which I passionately agree. That suggests to me that we need not only to think about public information campaigns in other countries, but occasionally to think about the need for continuing public information campaigns in the European Union as well because I am not sure that everybody outside these extraordinary halls, outside this Parliament, thinks exactly as we do. And we must remember that it is one of the tasks of political leadership to carry public opinion with you and not just to assume that everybody agrees with us. I thought Mr Rutelli's idea about a European day in our calendar when we make the case again and again against capital punishment was a sensible and effective idea which falls into the area that I have been touching on.</p>
<p class="contents">When I find myself disagreeing with the honourable lady, my initial reaction is that I must be wrong. The disagreement we have about the UN General Assembly is solely a disagreement about tactics. There is no question that we want to see as a medium-term objective, a successful resolution and the UN General Assembly against capital punishment. There is no question about that at all. It was our view last year that we could not succeed as we would have liked. That there was the real danger of a ending up with a resolution being accepted which would have made the point with which I thoroughly disagree, and I think the honourable lady thoroughly disagrees, that the human rights record in one country is no business of other countries. We could have seen the misuse of treaty language to make that point. We want to have a good clean text denouncing capital punishment and asserting the universal validity of human rights including the sanctity of life. We want to continue to build on what has been achieved in the Commission on human rights in order to build up the majority that we would like to see in the United Nations itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There were several references to countries where capital punishment is carried out in prodigious, horrific quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">There were references to China and we know well the record there. It is an issue that we raise again and again in our human rights dialogue. I cannot say hand on heart, or even hand off heart, that it is getting us very far, but we continue to raise the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an issue that we raise with the United States. We made a general <span class="italic">démarche</span> in the United States in February this year, in addition to the <span class="italic">démarches </span>we made to individual state authorities: for example, in relation to individual cases of the death penalty. We called upon the United States to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, with a view to completely eliminating capital punishment. We urged the United States to withdraw its reservation to the article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the prohibition on imposing the death penalty on minors. We also called upon the United States to respect the strict conditions under which the death penalty may be used, which is set out in several international instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">One or two honourable Members referred to the presidential debates. They referred to the fact that both the Republican and Democrat candidates, whatever they disagreed about – the size of government, the rate of taxes, moral standards in public life – the one thing they agreed on was capital punishment. They may agree about capital punishment. They may say capital punishment is effective and morally justified because they believe that. Most American politicians, public officials, seem to take that view and it is sometimes the case that public officials, elected officials, take particular points of view because they think they are popular. It may be that, going back to the point about public information, we also have to address that issue in even perhaps the best informed society in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of executions, the number of people in prison, the number of executions in the United States is extraordinarily high for a country whose democracy was celebrated in such appropriately eloquent terms by Alexis de Tocqueville a century ago. I am not sure what he would have thought about the presidential debates. I am not sure what he would have thought about the amount of capital punishment in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a useful, if admirably atypical, debate. I hope we have it again. But I hope that we also go out and debate this issue in company which is not so uniform in its judgments and wisdom. I hope we use our intellectual as well as financial resources to put the case again and again for the sanctity of human life, against the intolerable practice of capital punishment. We must all look forward to the day when capital punishment is regarded as a medieval barbarity, as it should be.</p>
