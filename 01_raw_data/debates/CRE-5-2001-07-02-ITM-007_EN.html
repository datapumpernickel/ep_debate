This resolution contains a number of very interesting points and the Commission has taken careful note of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the intention of this report has been to act as a platform for a wide-ranging discussion among Member States, the European Parliament and the sector. Since January, the report has been on the agenda of the Council working groups and of the SCA meetings and has been discussed in the last Council. The Commission is taking note of all opinions and positions and is currently actively studying and evaluating aspects related to the report and to the future of the sector and its COM.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission welcomes the points raised in the resolution by Parliament. In particular it supports the objectives of increasing the concentration of supply via producer organisations, reducing problems linked to operational programmes and improving the overall market regulation. The Commission would like to reassure Parliament that it is fully aware of the need to continue to work urgently on several aspects of this report and your current resolution. When this process of evaluation has been completed, the Commission intends to come forward with proposals to improve the COM where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission would like once more to thank Parliament for this resolution. It is prepared to maintain all necessary contact between its services and Parliament and looks forward to full discussion and cooperation on the future of the COM in the fruit and vegetable sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, first of all, to thank the Commission for its brief statement. I am sorry that the Commissioner responsible is not here, but I am very grateful to you, Mr Byrne, for joining us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only regret the fact, however, that you limited yourself simply to making a statement of good intentions and to thanking Parliament, without actually going into the problems or proposing any potential solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">A year has passed since the Council instructed the Commission to undertake a specific study of the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector, which is currently suffering more than any other, in a report on the workings of the COM in fruit and vegetables. In order to prevent disruption to support for this sector, an extension was approved for the improvement plans for the year 2000. We have now reached a point where, in 2001, this extension is coming to an end and the situation is creating considerable uncertainty in the sector, which risks causing farmers to abandon their land despite the gains that have been made as a result of the improvement plans.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem requires a decision, which can be implemented immediately by setting in motion support mechanisms replacing the current improvement plans as these come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The nut sector is of great social and environmental importance to the European Union, and to the southern countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and France, because these countries have many small farms that create a great number of jobs and which also have a considerable and direct influence on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of seeking a definitive solution for this sector, within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables. What we need now, Commissioner, is for the Presidency and the Commission to speed up their work on finding a definitive solution for the nut sector in the European Union within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables and, until then, to extend the improvement plans.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other problems of this COM and to those discussed in the report, I think that we need to support producers’ organisations and strengthen the instruments that the COM places at their disposal, especially the operational funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also want to encourage links and mergers between producers’ organisations and to see operational funds belonging to producers’ organisations that have merged – or the actions carried out jointly by various organisations – financed at a rate of 70% instead of the current 50%. They would therefore receive the same treatment that the current regulations give to actions undertaken within the industry or between trade organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that there needs to be a revision of the regulations in this field, in order to harmonise funding with operational funds or through rural development funds, with the sole proviso that adequate control mechanisms are put in place in order to ensure that funding is not given twice. This is creating distortions in the sector’s financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a more detailed study would also need to be undertaken of other aspects, such as the regulation of citrus fruits, measures for specific products affected by international competition and the standardisation of trade with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In broad terms, these are the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party and of a southern country, about the COM. Thank you very much, Commissioner, for joining us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only a disappointment to Parliament, because it adopts almost none of the recommendations of the requests contained in the Resolution of 26 October 2000, but it is also a disappointment to the whole production sector. The report does not adopt the work and the suggestions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development or those of Parliament itself, despite the fact that Commissioner Fischler stated a while ago that these would be taken into consideration. The report is incomplete: it fails to present practical solutions and nor does it make an in-depth study of the situation. Neither time nor energy has been expended on it and, I repeat, it is a disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">No solutions have been suggested for a sector which, in some parts of the European Union, is responsible for 25% of total agricultural output and provides the most employment. Are you aware, Commissioner, that out of every EUR 6 received by a fruit and vegetable producer in southern Europe, only EUR 0.012 comes from the European Union? Do you think that this can be called a genuine common organisation of the market or a real system of support? Is the Commission aware of this sector’s capacity for absorbing employees, particularly labour from the Maghreb, and does it realise, furthermore, that this sector has been more badly affected than any other by the liberalisation of trade with the countries from which these workers come? Do you not think that if it can find work for so many people – in objective 1 territories – we should take this into consideration and support the sector wholeheartedly instead of continuing to force farmers to bear the whole burden?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please undertake the necessary reforms that will provide real and unequivocal support for fruit and vegetable producers’ organisations. Please give real support, which has until now been lacking and which will enable these to increase not production, but the already high levels of food quality and safety and which will resolve the environmental problems affecting the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Please use the proposed reform to facilitate the concentration of supply in the face of distribution monopolies, the operators who dominate the market and who set their own prices and conditions. Please propose solutions that put an end to the problems of the operational programmes and funds, the excessive bureaucracy and the harmful consequences of trade agreements with third countries. Commissioner, how many times must we in Parliament repeat that the nut sector requires a definitive solution? How many times must we request that, until the reform of the market in the form of aid per hectare takes place, the improvement plans for the nut sector, which are crucial to preserving rural life in some very underdeveloped areas, which have no real alternatives, be extended?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, let us not make things so easy for the United States, Turkey or China. Let us protect our farmers and the nuts they grow, at least to the same degree to which these countries protect their farmers and crops. For months now, uncertainty has reigned in the production sector. In Andalusia, people have been shouting slogans such as ‘We won’t swap fish for tomatoes’ in an allusion to the agricultural concessions made to producers from the Maghreb during the fisheries negotiations. The Commission has already ensured that we will not have fish and is now on the way to ensuring that we will not have tomatoes either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, at the press conference following the last Council of Agricultural Ministers, Commissioner Fischler made it clear that he would not be making any proposals on the nut sector because he was waiting to hear Parliament’s opinion on his report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the fact that the issue of nuts has been included in three resolutions tabled by this Parliament in the last year, and that the Commission’s report was designed for the Council and not for Parliament, it would be appropriate to look at the background of the issue of fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">A radical reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables was carried out more than five years ago but, unfortunately, time has shown that the concentration of supply has not reached the hoped-for level and has highlighted other issues which seriously limit the effectiveness of the measures implemented in that reform.</p>
<p class="contents">In October last year, Parliament adopted a report which highlighted the fact that only 40% of produce is marketed through producers’ organisations. Given that the main instruments of the COM in fruit and vegetables centre on producers’ organisations, we can only conclude, as this House did at the time, that what we have is only half a COM. Consequently, at the time, we tabled a series of amendments designed to improve the effectiveness of the COM, including amendments to resolve the problem of nuts. In that debate, the Commissioner, Mr Fischler, stated that, although he viewed many of the amendments sympathetically, these went beyond the scope of the proposal submitted by the Commission. He also declared that since the Commission was due to present a report on the matter in a few months’ time, it would submit proposals to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, the Commission presented a report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables but, regrettably, did not follow this up with proposals. The report in question is essentially descriptive. It contains some very interesting information, which broadly concurs with the information contained in our report of October last year. The difference between the two reports lies in the fact that the Commission’s report is merely descriptive whereas Parliament’s report provided assessments and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, two problems. The first is the procedure to be followed once the Commission’s report has been presented and the second is the method to be decided on to resolve the problems affecting the sector as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the procedure, the problem lies in the fact that the Commission’s report contains no analysis or assessment. The Commission reveals that only 40% of production is marketed through producers’ organisations, but makes no assessment of whether this is too much or too little. It makes no analysis of the effects of this factor on the effectiveness of the COM and nor does it assess the advisability of making proposals. There is no sense in Parliament presenting a report on supposedly well-founded statistical data. What is needed is a report that discusses assessments and proposals, but the Commission’s report does not provide for this and furthermore, the European Parliament put these forward in October last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruit and vegetable sector has for some time been afflicted by a series of problems which need to be resolved as rapidly as possible: the COM in fruit and vegetables has a budget that does not reflect its importance as an economic activity; the regulations prevent the appropriations available to the COM in fruit and vegetables being used effectively and producers’ incomes are suffering the effects of upheavals in the market resulting from the gradual deterioration of Community preference and the continual increase in production costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to assess and compensate for the effects of trade agreements being signed with third countries and we need to encourage the concentration of supply via producer organisations. All of these issues, and some others – such as those concerning problems of operational programmes and funds – already feature in the report Parliament adopted last October and the urgent need to resolve these problems requires the Commission to present proposals within the meaning defined in the report that we adopted. Now, in order to respond to the legitimate concerns of the Community’s fruit and vegetable producers, Parliament must call on the Commission to present proposals, which we shall comment on once they have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to end without making a brief mention of nuts, because my fellow Members have focussed mainly on this issue. If any matter is genuinely urgent amongst all the urgent matters of the COM in fruit and vegetables, it is to resolve the nut issue. In October, Parliament also put forward definitive proposals on this matter in order to resolve the problems. I therefore find it incredible that the Commissioner claims not to be aware of the proposals that Parliament has made repeatedly on this subject. We must, as a matter of priority, provide a definitive solution for this sector and until the Commission matches the proposals already presented by Parliament, we must extend the measures currently in force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that this is happening far too often. I say this to the Commissioner present, but in particular so that he may pass it on to Mr Fischler. We continually have difficulties with production in the south of Europe, with Mediterranean production, and this is no accident. It deserves Parliament’s attention because, in comparative terms, these problems receive much less attention than problems involving northern agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission must understand that it is irritating for the European Parliament to have to insist on issues which, according to the Commission’s own words, should already have been resolved. This is noted in the recitals which head the motion for a resolution which we are presenting on the occasion of this oral question. In recital A, it is noted that the European Parliament affirms that there is great consistency between the Commission and the Council but, however, later on, we believe that the facts do not reflect this.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also a commitment from the Commission to resolve this series of problems caused by the last reform of fruit and vegetables. This is not reflected either. In recital C, for example, it is noted that the Commission constantly tells us that it is aware of these problems, but it is not consistent, because it does not translate its projects into facts and is yet to present its corresponding legislative proposal. This motion for a resolution therefore asks the Commission to present proposals to improve the functioning of the COM in fruit and vegetables, in particular with regard to the reorganisation of the producers’ organisations and with regard to nuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you must be aware that the only aid not to have been given continuity by Agenda 2000 has been that intended for nuts. Mr President, you know as well as I that the roads of Spain are blocked, and the Commission cannot ignore this problem, because this sector is paying for the consequences of a violation of the principle of Community preference and a dreadful marketing policy. I ask that the needs of this sector be responded to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, in Europe, we basically have two types of agriculture: the first is heavily subsidised and depends on support from the CAP. The second depends on the market and on the risks that farmers are forced to run in this market. Unfortunately, the fruit and vegetable sector, and particularly the nut sector, fall within this second group of products, a type of poor stepson of the CAP, which has to make a living from the market and which has to run risks in the market, with all the uncertainties agriculture is facing. The common agricultural policy has not provided an adequate response to this problem. Nuts, as the Commissioner knows, are a crop grown in parts of southern Europe, in arid and semiarid areas, where there are often few alternatives to dry farming. One cannot even use the argument that this is an intensive form of farming that damages the environment. Quite the opposite is true. We have seen this sector being all but abandoned over the last few years and we now run the risk of entering a legal vacuum, because the Commission, for reasons unknown to us, has decided not to submit any proposals. It is truly deplorable that this should be the case, and so this motion for a resolution that we are tabling in Parliament today is designed to make the Commission aware of this omission, this vacuum, and to make it submit adequate proposals for the fruit and vegetable sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, there are three situations that I think we must consider. The first is the need to provide a response, to legislate on the operational funds for producers’ organisations. It is also clearly crucial, as Mrs Ayuso González and other Members have said, for cofinancing to be raised to 70%. Support for the workings of the operational funds must be effective. Secondly, we must be aware that establishing the operational funds as the main agricultural policy instrument for the sector is not enough, because there are many regions, such as Spain and Portugal, where producers’ organisations are almost non-existent, and where less than 10% of production passes through such organisations. We must come up with measures that respond to the needs of producers in these areas and, until producers’ organisations are in place there, it would be unfair and unacceptable to marginalise them. Thirdly, Commissioner, it is high time that we adopted permanent support measures for nut producers. Why not consider direct aid? If almost all sectors are given such aid, why should this sector, which is so poor and so marginalised within Europe, not be given support? I hope that the Commission will rapidly submit the proposals that we are calling for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present economic climate has dangerously upset the delicate competitive balance for Community producers in this sector and the Commission needs to react immediately in order to prevent them from going under altogether. We are all aware of the importance of this sector, of which previous speakers have painted a dramatic picture. The facts of the matter, and the present economic climate which I referred to earlier are as follows, especially for our products.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the devaluation of the Turkish lira, on the one hand, and the particularly aggressive policy of other producers, such as the USA, on the other, have put Community producers in a most unfortunate position. So what are we proposing in order to help the Commission? That programmes and aid which are about to expire be extended and that urgent, effective support be given to Community producers and ways be found of supporting producers, especially in the present economic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to point out, as other speakers have done, that the producers of these products, especially dried fruit and nuts, are small, poor producers and, more specifically, Mediterranean producers. Their organisations fall short when it comes to pooling their products and competing with their own resources on this difficult market, as I mentioned earlier. So what we want, in addition to any other measures, is for special attention to be paid to producer organisations and for ways to be found of supporting them, so that they can organise themselves efficiently and deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">So I too am adamant. We must vote in favour of this motion for a resolution and we want the Commission to respond to this concern on our part.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore crucial that the Commission draws up a reform of the common organisation of the market in this area, given that the last reform was carried out in 1996. The Commission must put right the most negative aspects of this COM, such as those concerning nuts, the sector's poor relation, and increase the aid ceilings for operational funds for producers’ organisations. It is unfair that a sector such as that of fruit and vegetables should continue to receive only 4% of Community aid when it creates more employment in the European Union than almost any other sector. It is, therefore, crucial that the Commission takes account of the proposals presented last year in the Jové Peres report, which were adopted by this Parliament, specifically in terms of increasing production thresholds and levels of support, in terms of increasing co­financing of the operational fund for producers’ organisations and in terms of safeguarding this important sector of agriculture, which is also suffering from the pressure of imports. These are the result of bilateral agreements in which this sector has sometimes been used as a bargaining chip, with no account being taken of the interests of the southern countries or of the importance that it has for employment and for the development of these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is still in the process of listening to opinions and comments. However, as I mentioned previously, the Commission's services are already well into the process of evaluating these opinions. The comments of Parliament are, of course, included in this evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early to say when any possible proposals and solutions might be presented. The Commission cannot issue a calendar of any steps ahead. Many factors are involved, including budgetary aspects and the need to harmonise future policies between market sectors. I can, however, assure you once again that the Commission services are considering this issue as a priority. It hopes to move as soon as possible to a situation whereby full discussions can be held with all interested parties in the fruit and vegetable sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question as to whether the Commission will propose a long-term solution for nuts, the Commission services are aware of the situation in the nut sector and the points of view of all interested parties. In this context, the Commission is in the process of evaluating whether and to what extent some further support may be available. This evaluation process is taking place in the wider context of the report. In any case, any possible future support could only be envisaged if coupled with reconversion. However, the policy of a one-year stop-gap extension of nut improvement plans does not seem, to the Commission, to be an appropriate way of addressing this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The most needed adjustments to the 1996 reform were, in fact, ensured by the adoption in December last year of Regulation 2699/2000. With this regulation, we simplified and improved the schemes for financing of operational funds, for processed tomatoes, peaches, pears and citrus fruits and also addressed the question relating to export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a number of Members asked some technical questions dealing with the different mechanisms of the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables and I hope that you will accept that this is not, of course, within my own daily responsibilities. I would prefer to leave these questions to my colleague, Franz Fischler. It has not been possible for Commissioner Fischler to be here tonight, but he has informed me that he would be very pleased to discuss these issues with you in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
