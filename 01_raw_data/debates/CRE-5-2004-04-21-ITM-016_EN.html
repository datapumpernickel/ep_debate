Alas, we do not currently have the power in this House to censure individuals - we have only this nuclear option.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps in Eurostat's case this is the best thing. The problem here is that the Commissioners are happy to make great political statements on policy but absolutely refuse to take political responsibility for problems that occur in their DGs. Effective political control, proper communication, procedures and financial checks and balances were either not in place in Eurostat, failed to work, or were simply ignored. In fact all the warning signs were completely ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, EUR 5 million went missing because of fraud and bad management controls. Yet the only person to be arrested was a journalist - Hans-Martin Tillack - who chose to report this in <span class="italic">Stern</span> and whose office was raided again today. It is not amazing that OLAF can act with such speed involving police in trying to get the name of a journalist and checking his bank accounts in days. However, if you compare this to the Eurostat case, where after more than a year of investigations we have basically nothing, it begs the question of the priorities of various individuals within the DG responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discharge process for 2001, Eurostat was one of our rapporteur's key themes. We now know that not all the information we needed at the time was made available to this House. Many MEPs are now on record as saying that if they had been given all the facts at the time, they would have voted against discharge for those accounts last year. If the Commission and the leaders of all the political groups in this Parliament had put half as much energy into solving the systemic problems shown up by the Eurostat case as they have in trying to block this motion from having an airing on the floor of the House, then all these problems could have been solved years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission deserves to be censured, and future Commissioners need to know that they will take political responsibility for the actions of their DGs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as my colleague Mr Fischler stated yesterday, the Commission took immediate action when it had evidence of the problems in Eurostat. This has resulted in a thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General and its operations. In addition to the statement made by my colleague on behalf of the Commission, I would like to emphasise the measures regarding in particular the revision of the code of conduct, the improvement of the flow of information related to fraud allegations, as well as a revision of the legal framework of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to point out the following measures. Firstly, revising the code of conduct that governs relations between the Commissioners and their services and which emphasises the political responsibility of the Commissioner, as well as that of the Director-General or the head of service. The new code includes specific procedures requiring the Commissioner to be informed about any fact, situation or question concerning management – especially financial management – the gravity of which could invoke the responsibility of the Commissioner or the college.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, putting in place measures aimed at facilitating the cross-referencing of any information related to fraud allegations, helping to ensure that the political level is kept informed and that any cases detected are properly followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, strengthening information circuits between the central services and operational services, especially in the areas of control and internal audit. This involves a series of important measures that aim at fine-tuning financial management reforms that had already been introduced by the Prodi Commission. These measures derive essentially from the recommendations which the internal auditor made in his report on DG Eurostat's contracts - informing and training staff about the different mechanisms in place for whistleblowing and revising OLAF's legal framework with the adoption of two new legislative proposals to be examined by the new Parliament. These proposals aim to improve the information flows within the institutions of the Union and to reinforce the procedural guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the crisis, Eurostat's functions in performing the essential statistical work of the Commission have not been interrupted. A major reorganisation of Eurostat was approved by the Commission on 29 September 2003 and the new establishment plan has been in operation since 1 November. The system of approval for commitments and payments was reorganised. The financial circuits were more explicitly defined so as to bring into play the responsibilities of the delegated authorising officers at head of unit and directorate level. The Commission's decision to end the contractual links with four companies required a significant amount of work in ending the contracts themselves and in ensuring that the potential for litigation was minimised. Following on from the special audit undertaken by the internal audit service in September 2003, as well from the in-depth audit that had recently been concluded, a series of initiatives generated by the annual activity report were also undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a radical new departure in the field of providing statistical information. Based on the principle that European statistical information is a public service, all statistical data drawn up and collected by Eurostat should be available free of charge to users and should be available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the work programme for 2004 is strictly prioritised and intentionally realistic. The emphasis is on the essential missions of Eurostat, namely the production of figures and independent statistics. The Commission is keen to reduce its dependence on external companies and organisations and to ensure that the European statistical service remains a public service which is open and available to users and acts in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has thus taken very concrete and swift measures to respond to the criticism made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 17 December 2003 on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004. This is also confirmed in the Commission's progress report of 9 February 2004 on completing the reform mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, for having voted today by a large majority to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the execution of the general budget of the European Communities for 2002. This vote confirms that the Eurostat affair is a very regrettable exception to the generally sound financial management of the budget of the European Communities. However, the Eurostat affair also shows the necessity and the importance of the reform progress engaged by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the political responsibility mentioned in the motion of censure that is going to be debated here tonight, I would like to confirm the position of the Commission as very clearly stated by President Prodi in his speech of 25 September 2003 at the conference of presidents of the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to underline, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer did yesterday when answering a question from Mrs Avilés Perea, that the reform measures will prevent problems like those which occurred in Eurostat before 1999 from recurring, and that the Commission has learned its lesson with regard to the problem of inadequate information flows revealed by the Eurostat case and has taken appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi and his whole Commission are committed to zero tolerance against fraud. You know very well that this is not a guarantee that no fraud will ever occur but it is a guarantee that nothing will be hushed up. Potential problems will be brought out into the open and appropriate measures will be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">As also stated by my colleague Mr Fischler today, the Commission remains committed to following up on actions taken to maximise the safeguards against fraud and it is grateful to the European Parliament for its substantial contribution and its continued support in this matter.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening is both regrettable and, in my view, dangerous. It is regrettable because the signatories to this motion actually have no other objective than to sully the reputation of the Commission, which, although it can be criticised for its management of the Eurostat matter, certainly does not deserve a vote of no confidence from Parliament. It is also dangerous, because this is an important time in the history of European integration with the unification of the continent on 1 May, the European elections, hopefully the adoption of the Constitution and the fight against terrorism. The process can only be weakened by mediocre political manoeuvres that do not fool anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not in any way wish to minimise the importance of the questions surrounding the Eurostat affair, but above all, I wish to understand the real reasons that led those who signed this motion of censure to do so. Was it really their concern for transparency? I do not think so. Was it really their desire to shed light on the Eurostat affair? I am sure it was not. There are two reasons why I think not. The first reason is the time that was chosen for this initiative, Parliament’s last legislative sitting. Some will naively argue that this is a coincidence, but I would like to point out that more objective observers will note the proximity of the European elections. I would draw attention to the fact that the questions surrounding Eurostat were raised as long as two years ago. If a desire for transparency was behind this step, the motion of censure would have come much sooner.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason to back up my arguments is the list of signatories to this motion of censure. Everyone is free to defend their convictions and undoubtedly the Members who support the motion of censure are doing so from their soul and their conscience. The majority of them, however, have an anti-European soul and a merely national conscience. Despite appearances, it is not the Commission that is being targeted, but European integration. It is not a defence of the interests of European taxpayers, but a desire to destroy the reputation of a Europe, which, although it is not perfect, is an effective way for our people to live in peace and relative prosperity. This motion of censure is the work of the ‘inward-looking’ club of people who reject common policies, fight against European progress waving flags of fear, and reject the contract of trust that is the European Constitution proposed by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not trying to offend anyone by saying this, because this is what they are doing by making people believe that Europe is a machine, a monster that regulates everything, decides everything, cheats and I do not know what else.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has chosen a different path to the signatories, because we talk about the future while others stay stuck in the past, because Europe is not built on fear, but on ambition and will. It is true that everything is not perfect. There is still a great deal to do, particularly giving real political meaning to what is a human step, because it is a human venture to welcome the ten new countries, which are a symbolic example.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Eurostat affair, the PPE-DE Group as a whole has always publicly expressed a desire for light to be shed on the affair. We have noted the measures taken by the Commission. We want those responsible to explain themselves because we strongly suspect that major mistakes have been made. Those responsible must, however, be punished in proportion to any mistakes that become apparent. We owe the European people a sense of responsibility, respect for democratic procedures and a guarantee of the rule of law. Inquiries need to be conducted, there needs to be punishment for the mistake, the punishment needs to be fair and there must be transparency. This is what we have always said, this is what we are fighting for.</p>
<p class="contents">To claim, however, as the signatories to this motion of censure are doing, that the Commission has not fulfilled its obligations, to seek to blemish a Commission at the end of its mandate which has of course made mistakes but which has a commendable record, is not acceptable to us.

<p class="contents">When the Santer Commission fell 5 years ago, most of us Socialists allowed ourselves to be pushed up against a wall by, to some extent, defending the indefensible. We have learnt from this. Having, at the time, been one of the minority who voted in favour of the vote of no-confidence, I am now all the more convinced in speaking on behalf of my own group against the farce of a no-confidence vote, the only purpose of which would be to serve those newspapers of which it can be said that we do not know whether they are written for illiterates or by them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To make one thing clear, that assessment is transnational, it applies to several countries and not just to one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is legitimate, even in this Parliament, to be against European integration and therefore against the Community institutions. The question, however, is whether the systematic discrediting of the EU institutions should be allowed to become a means whereby political debate is carried out. This question is not to be put to the Tories or to the European United Left, because they have a record of doing this, and will carry on doing so. The question, rather, is whether those who are in favour of political integration in this House are going to leave these people without resistance. I am in favour of resisting.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also defending ourselves against the abuse of Budget control for clearly political purposes. Even you, Mr Heaton-Harris, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, have frequently made it clear that the reasons that led to the collapse of the Santer Commission do not apply in this case, whatever criticism may be levelled at the present Commission. In contrast to the Santer Commission, the current Commission, despite all the mistakes, has not attempted to conceal information systematically from Parliament. That is the decisive point. Mr Bösch and Mr Casaca were two Socialists involved in a leading role in the preparation of the events surrounding Eurostat. Using the Eurostat case as an electoral instrument is the best way to distract the incipient reform process and we do not wish to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">The bizarre nature of this circus act is now making two things clear, and they should be made public in this session. The signatories of the motion for a vote of no confidence include a Member of this House who personally urged me several months ago to ensure that the Eurostat story was buried. In his own words, his reasons were that the closer the elections come, the madder MEPs get. He has now signed the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">When this morning – and here I am addressing Mr Bonde – we sat down in a circle in order to discuss the overall approach to the subject of Eurostat, you kindly asked whether it would not be possible to make it superfluous by including in the resolution on Eurostat a couple of sharp paragraphs on the subject of political responsibility, because you did not know whether the no-confidence motion would work out all right. Mr Bonde, we are not proposing to get you out of the mess in which you have buried yourself. The majority of this Parliament will not give you a helping hand; you must manage it yourself. In May, when the new Commissioners arrive, you are welcome to propose that all ten be promptly sent back home, and then you will be exposed as fools before the European public for having abused this instrument of the no-confidence motion for purely party political purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, no one believes they are to blame for anything at all. This was the conclusion of the report, submitted by the so-called Committee of Wise Men in March 1999, into the problems of the earlier Santer Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of the Eurostat scandal. All the defence mechanisms have been set in motion. Commissioner Solbes is not to blame because he does not read newspapers. Commissioner Kinnock is not to blame because he was not listening when Mr Blak told him what Mrs Schmidt Brown had said. Commissioner Schreyer was not to blame because she does not read audit reports, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, is not at all to blame because he obviously ensured that no information got through to him either from the European Parliament or the press, and if you do not know about something you cannot be to blame for it, as Mr Prodi says.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing one might wonder is how people with so little ability to perceive what is going on around them have come to be so high up.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, of course, that they had known what was going on at Eurostat for at least a year, but they kept under wraps something that should not have been kept under wraps. You could call it misplaced loyalty to a corrupt system. You could call it nepotism. Whatever you call it, it is not worthy of an inter-European institution. That is why we want to establish who is to blame, but the system is designed to prevent us from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">In a normal democracy, critics within a parliament can move a vote of censure. This occasionally happens in our Member States. If a government has a solid majority, it will be fairly indifferent. A government that wins a vote of censure generally comes out of the vote stronger. In this case, the Commission is certain to win, because the majority here in Parliament do not wish blame to be apportioned, and those of us tabling this motion of censure know that we will lose.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, those loyal to the Commission have been busy preventing us from holding this debate and the subsequent vote at all. Signatures have been placed under suspicion and removed for no objective reason, and Members have been pressurised into withdrawing their signatures. That is not true parliamentarianism. There is something rotten permeating the entire issue of Eurostat, and a majority in Parliament do not want to contribute to apportioning the blame.</p>

<p class="contents">Over 100 Members of the European Parliament signed a motion of censure against the Commission, but one in three was pressurised into withdrawing his or her signature. The die-hards now include some Members who may lose their places on important committees or in delegations. Members of this Parliament will be punished by their groups for supporting the simple principle of the responsibility of ministers and Commissioners for their conduct in office.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s highly politicised administration is no longer there solely to serve its Members. Not content with checking the authenticity of the signatures and counting them, it has cooperated with the groups in getting Members to withdraw their signatures. It has even refused to accept confirmation sent by fax and quite obviously genuine signatures in order to stifle or stave off the debate on censure. Do we also have to verify the signatures on the attendance lists by means of handwritten original letters?</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine if all the group chairmen were as keen to penalise the people in the Commission who have had their hands in the till, or those covering up for the thieves. Nothing is, however, so bad that there is not some good in it somewhere. The compromise text on Eurostat contains the fiercest criticism to date of the Commission’s financial management. It still does not apportion direct responsibility, however, and we are thus weakening those in the Commission who are working to bring about honest accounting and transparency. We are backing up those who say that approving the accounts is just parliamentary chit-chat, that it does not mean anything and that we can carry on swindling people. EUR 8 billion disappears from our budget every year. It is taxpayers’ money, and we have been elected to this Parliament in order to represent taxpayers. Consequently, we must call upon the Commission to apportion the blame itself by 12 noon on Tuesday 4 May. Otherwise, we shall vote on the motion of censure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the more than 100 members who are signatories. There may be more of us watchdogs after the elections. I should like to thank you, Mr President, and to the person who said that this was electioneering I would point out that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have attempted to apportion political responsibility for this from the very first day the scandal came to light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The assessment made by that resolution is damning. What is more serious is not so much the Eurostat affair itself because, after all, misappropriation can affect any body, but rather the monitoring failures that it revealed, and, above all, the inability of the Commission to convincingly put things right.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution of 29 January, which I remind you again was adopted by the European Parliament, criticised the culture of secrecy and lack of transparency in the Commission, the poor internal communication of information, the fact that it was extremely slow and reticent in submitting audit reports to the European Parliament, and the fact that the Commissioners were shirking their political responsibilities. The last of these characteristics seems to be even more true now, as the Commission no longer accepts any responsibility for this affair and Mr Prodi, who did not even come to our debate this evening, seems to be more interested in the electoral campaign in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why Members must take on their own responsibility today as elected representatives of the people of Europe, the taxpayers of Europe. I congratulate the sixty-six other co-signatories to this motion, led by Mr Bonde and Mr Heaton-Harris, who had the courage and clarity to resist all the pressure. I would like to say this to Members who are hesitating to vote in favour of the motion of censure: by defending the Commission, as Mrs Grossetête just did, whether you like it or not, you will be covering up unacceptable behaviour and providing a very poor service to the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to provide a good service to the European institutions is to make the Commission understand that it is not superior, that it is a body like all the other bodies, which has to give in to the higher control of the European Parliament and the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everybody is aware that for some time we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have been working very hard to try to clarify this issue and resolve the problems stemming from it. It is true that the Commission took a long time to react, but it finally did so and implemented an in-depth reform and, so far, we believe that the results are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the case is not closed, since a judicial procedure is underway. The majority of the political groups have therefore prepared a resolution which will be voted on during tomorrow’s sitting, precisely because we are still concerned about such an enormously important issue as fraud in Eurostat. We do not believe this issue to be closed, and we believe we must monitor events very closely in order to prevent any repeat of it in the future, either in Eurostat or in any other Commission body.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution various groups will table tomorrow makes it very clear that Parliament is vigilant, is carrying out its duty and is exercising the control conferred on it by the Treaty as a fundamental Community institution throughout the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no justification for this motion; it is a purely electoral issue for the signatories, who have in common, amongst many other things, their anti-European sentiment and militancy, their Euroscepticism and their constant campaign against the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that this motion is inappropriate. We in the European Parliament do our work, we have done so seriously and rigorously, and we are going to continue to do so, and we do not believe that a group of Members who call themselves anti-European and Eurosceptic are the right people to defend the transparency and smooth functioning of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In our work, we have often insisted that it is necessary to trust in the control of the Commission’s management, as we have done this morning, while making it clear that we are still concerned about the problem of Eurostat, and we therefore believe it is entirely inappropriate for small groups in this House - whose record and approach in relation to this issue have been very well-known from the outset and have never changed - to try to use this issue for electoral party political ends. They have taken no notice of explanations or solutions, nor any type of suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the People's Group is very clear and we will continue to work to ensure the openness and transparency of the European institutions and also to strengthen them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the fact that this was drawn up and signed by minorities known for being anti-Europeanist quite clearly exposes this intention. This is confirmation that, in making Parliament’s work more frenzied, the run-up to the elections is inspiring initiatives such as the one that we are dealing with this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurostat affair is once again being discussed by some of our fellow Members to bring general discredit to the European institutions and, in particular, to the Commission and its President. My fellow Members who signed this document know that the Eurostat affair has been – and still is being – continuously and thoroughly tracked by this Parliament and will be the subject of an umpteenth resolution in this sitting too. The bad faith concerning this affair is clear to see when nothing is said about the specific measures adopted by the Commission and, more generally, about the reforms implemented in order to achieve the good governance that we want to inspire all the European Union’s institutions, a process followed<span class="bold"> </span>step by step by this Parliament and by its Committee on Budgetary Control too, and mentioned here by Commissioner Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is easy to stir up scandal about particular issues in order to try to grab the attention of the public, which is often ill informed about politics and the European institutions. It is more difficult to give Europe a political dimension, starting with adopting a real constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, as a representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, it is a matter of pride to me that no one in my group signed this motion. The support of the British Conservatives once again clearly shows the untenable association of this group with the European People’s Party tradition, so well represented by Mrs Grossetête and also by Mrs Avilés Perea.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the signatories, I then notice many Members from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, in which the representatives of the Italian <span class="italic">Alleanza</span> <span class="italic">Nazionale </span>stand out in particular. It seems to me that this position contrasts somewhat with the role that the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Fini, played in the work of the Convention. This is perhaps why Mrs Muscardini wisely withdrew her signature. If the Members of her delegation were to follow her example, moreover, that would even cast doubt on the safety of the 66 signatures announced by the President this evening, without even mentioning the so-called ‘technical signatures’, which should not turn into votes in favour either.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another key to interpreting the true intentions lurking behind those who tabled this motion, and it is the one given by the Vice-President of Italy’s Senate, Mr Calderoli, chief representative of the <span class="italic">Lega Nord. </span>He claimed that, in actual fact, the signatories are secret supporters of Mr Prodi. Indeed, this Parliament’s trust in the President of the Commission would be strengthened and his prestige increased as a result of this motion, which will certainly be rejected. If this is true, though, what is to be said then about Mr Speroni, a member of the same party as Mr Calderoli? Is he aware of being converted into one of the most fervent supporters of the European Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">If things are really like this and we look at the motion of censure in this light, then I believe that all of the group of signatories have something to think about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When, however, I listened to Mrs Grossetête, Mr Kuhne etc., I was reminded of when, in the Eighties, I visited the Supreme Soviet in Moscow where all critics were held up to ridicule, condemned and accused of being anti-Soviet and traitors. Is that the way in which you are to defend your EU project? Is it to be done by means of accusations and ridicule, through the harassment of whistleblowers and by setting the police on investigative journalists?</p>
<p class="contents">Have you not noticed that the project is suffering from a crisis of confidence due to the lack of transparency and democratic legitimacy? We are attempting to use a classic parliamentary tool to monitor the executive. You may have a different view but, when you ridicule us, run us down and call us anti-Europeans, you undermine the democratic legitimacy of your own project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite frankly, I do not feel that I am either illiterate or, even less so, an anti-Europeanist, nor do I believe that I can be blamed for bringing the Commission into disrepute; if anything it did that on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we were practically forced into this extreme measure by the Commission’s indifference and perfunctory attitude towards Parliament, because – and I want to mention this – this is not an impromptu move. For more than a year, there have been hundreds of questions and a large body of parliamentary work behind this extreme move. In any case, we expected the Commission to act less like Pontius Pilate; this is what we expected and, I believe, what we deserved since, after all, we are the only institution that has genuine popular legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go back over the many questions to which adequate responses were not given, or the good proposals stated by the Commission for the future. Once again, however, I would like to comment on the organisation involved, that is to say Eurostat<span class="italic">.</span> It is worth remembering that Eurostat<span class="italic"> </span>does not deal with generating interesting and harmless statistics. Eurostat<span class="italic"> </span>is an institution which, through its surveying and statistical work, is in fact the guarantor of the Stability and Growth Pact: it monitors the application of the Maastricht criteria. It is, therefore, involved in setting out the economic and financial policies of the Member States and, indeed, in making Member States adopt strict policies that often entail budget and welfare cutbacks. It is, therefore, an institution that has a monitoring role, and its impartiality and authoritativeness must not be even slightly scarred by the doubts and suspicions that hang over Eurostat today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, sorry, Commissioner Reding, but the Eurostat affair cannot be crossed off as a deplorable exception. We realise that the affair is embarrassing, it is for me too, but I believe it is the citizens that are calling for this not to be tolerated, the same people whom we are asking to make sacrifices in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to give lessons in democracy to anyone – God forbid – but I would like to quietly mention that democracy is based on the rights of minorities to express their opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every week we issue resolution after resolution, giving lectures in democracy, transparency, human rights and whatever else, to the whole world, and we are not capable of organising a debate, worthy of a Parliament deserving of that name, on censure, which in all of our democracies, is an important moment in political, democratic and parliamentary life.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that we can only make our mark by opposing. This is how the national parliaments have been created throughout history, generally against the arbitrary nature of executive powers. That is not the case here. Think about it, if you will, Mrs Grossetête, that is not the case here. The executive and legislative powers are thick as thieves, dodging the truth, like in the famous Vermeer painting, in view of the onlookers, European citizens. I admit that you have impressed me in this exercise, Mrs Grossetête. I am talking about dodging the truth, about dishonesty, and I would even say that you reminded me somewhat of Vichinsky pleading before the Soviet Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The proximity of the elections may exacerbate people’s attitudes, that is quite natural for a democrat: the elections are not a difficult time to get through, as you seem to think. We spent an hour this morning, Mr President, an hour, and we also did so in the last sitting, pushing and shoving each other out of the way for reasons which, personally, entirely escape me. Is that the type of democracy that you want to set an example for? We spent an hour this morning and we will definitely spend two or three hours tomorrow morning debating an obscure manoeuvre of Italian internal policy. Is that the democracy that you are talking about? You should recognise, Mrs Grossetête, that it would be at least paradoxical for this Parliament which, I repeat, gives lectures to the whole world, to act like a frightened virgin when it comes to exercising the only power that it has: monitoring and censuring the European Commission when it has made a mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wanted to prevent him from ending this European affair in the shameful role of someone who is as slippery as an eel when faced with questions and demands posed by different newspapers – and we would have thought that he would have had the decency to be present in this House to discuss this issue – whilst one of the people who exposed the information is being investigated, as in the good old days of the communist police, and his files are confiscated because he dares to investigate European fraud and Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">The scandal concerns a body of the European institutions that deals with funds and sensitive data, and this makes it a serious fact. The Eurostat dossier has compromised the image of the European Commission and its President, who – in our opinion – would do well to draw from it the necessary consequences.</p>
