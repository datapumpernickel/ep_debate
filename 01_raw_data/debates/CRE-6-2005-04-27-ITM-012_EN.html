<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ieke van den Burg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I should like to start by apologising to my Dutch fellow MEPs for speaking, not in Dutch but in English, which is, after all, the language of the financial markets. There is also the added benefit that I can address the Commissioner in a language he understands. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, when the Commissioner’s predecessor Mr Bolkestein started his term, he met with a well-prepared, ambitious set of proposals for the internal market for capital. He presented them in 1999 as the Financial Services Action Plan – FSAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have the impression that you are less fortunate with the heritage concerning the internal market for services that Mr Bolkestein left for you when you came here to Brussels, and which carries his name, or perhaps an ominous nickname. But that is not our subject for today; we will have plenty of time to discuss this further.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to praise Mr Bolkestein for having diligently steered the FSAP through during his term in office. Commissioner, I am very much looking forward to the follow-up plan in the Green Paper that you are to present next week. In the report before you and in the debates that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we take a positive view of the way the FSAP has been dealt with, but of course we are aware that many of the intentions laid down in the rules still have to be proven in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Major attention should be focused on the implementation and enforcement of the almost 40 sets of rules that have been adopted. Unfortunately, there were some misunderstandings about my report in the form in which it has been presented to the plenary today. Although a broad consensus was reached in committee and we had good compromises, some imperfections slipped in during the committee vote. Since they concern the main thrust of the report, I would like to discuss them first.</p>
<p class="contents">The most annoying mistake is paragraph 2 of the text before the House today. It suggests that we should go along with the plea of some lobbyists and journalists that Brussels legislators should commit themselves to a regulatory pause. But that is really not my cup of tea. This paragraph 2 absolutely does not fit into a report that points to so many developments in a dynamic financial market that may pose serious systemic risks and endanger a safe and efficient internal market for financial services. Therefore, I am clearly against tying our hands with a moratorium on legislation. We should stay alert and the Commission should be very proactive. Of course, this new legislation should be thoroughly assessed as to its necessity, its costs and benefits and its wider impact, but less regulation is not always better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some other elements of the report, such as the Lamfalussy Process. With the well-known disclaimers that you are used to from the European Parliament, the report is quite positive about the Lamfalussy Process. I tend to see the Level Three Committees of regulators in particular as allies for the public interest and the protection of consumers and expert users. I note that they are more and more aware of their important role in harmonising the technical rules and the supervisory practices between regulators in different Member States. The Himalaya report presented by CESR asks for an improved toolbox. We say in the report before the House today that this is a good starting point for further debate. Some important issues have to be resolved in the coming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is European-level supervision. In the report we speak positively about a move towards consolidating supervisors. The industry wants to reduce the need to comply with many different supervisors, but on the other hand I can understand the hesitation of regulatory authorities in host situations to give up their competences and to rely completely on foreign supervisors. That is why I insist on taking a further step. Seeing the growth in cross border activity and the concentration of large players in the financial markets, it is time for integrated supervision at European level, possibly via a two-tier system with European-level supervision for large cross-border players without prejudice to the level playing field between cross-border and local players. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but at least in the report we agree that this should be an option that the Commission should also consider further.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of consumer protection and involvement. Here we stress that the protection of consumers and the guaranteed availability of basic financial services to all consumers should remain a basic condition. I do not think that we should aim at complete harmonisation in relation to retail financial products and service provision, because consumer protection is too different in the various Member States. In the report I propose looking at the option of a 26th regime for pan-European financial products, such as mortgages or insurance products. They may meet the needs of internationally mobile people to work with the providers they are used to in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berès, the chairwoman of our committee, will speak on the issue of better cooperation in a global setting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, it is already clear the coming five years will be extremely challenging in this particular area. The smooth functioning of financial markets is essential and has a huge influence on the prosperity of each and every one of us. Financial investments underpin jobs and growth; the value of our savings; our pensions; the cost of our mortgages. Deep, liquid, dynamic European financial markets will ensure the most efficient allocation and provision of capital and services throughout the European economy, and beyond, in the global capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last six years we have seen major progress. Most of the necessary rules outlined in the Financial Services Action Plan have been agreed on time and are now being put in place. European decision-making and regulatory structures have become more rational and efficient. Continued systematic cooperation has developed between the European institutions and market participants. All institutions and a very large majority of the market participants agree we need to continue our efforts, because our job to integrate the European financial markets is far from finished.</p>
<p class="contents">Our key priority for the next 12 months is to complete unfinished business in the area of financial services. We still need to deal with the remaining elements in the negotiation phase before this House and the Council, as well as the key measures now under preparation by the Commission. For example, we still need to allow more risk-sensitivity in the capital requirements for banks and investment firms (Basel II); strengthen statutory audit (the eighth Company Law Directive); fight money laundering and terrorist finance; cut down the costs for clearing and settlement; establish a European framework for reinsurance; modernise rules on insurance solvency; and create a European legal framework for payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the regulatory measures currently under preparation are already extremely demanding for all of us. However, I am confident we can achieve a lot in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of financial services, the Commission commends the good work done in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs over the last years, and, more particularly, the report we are discussing today. There is a considerable degree of convergence between our own thinking and the thinking in the European Parliament. Many of the main themes included in the report presented today by Mrs Van den Burg on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will also be reflected in the Commission’s Green Paper on its future financial services policy. We address similar priorities. In a way there is no surprise there, as we have both been very transparent in our approach and preparatory work. I do not wish to dwell on all the recommendations set out in the report, but let me highlight some which I believe are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is a clear need to coordinate transposition by the Member States, strengthen enforcement and increase supervisory convergence. I broadly endorse the views expressed in the report. Particularly, I think paragraph 14 gives the right nuance as some form of integrated supervision will only be beneficial if regulation is no longer fragmented. Convergence will not occur if an integrated supervisor still needs to interpret and apply 25 different sets of regulations. Therefore, the Commission endorses a step-by-step approach, building on the European regulatory and supervisory committees in the area of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the better regulation agenda is important. The Commission agrees that future measures must be targeted and evidence based; impact assessments will be thoroughly applied. Basic pan-European framework rules are needed so that businesses can develop European strategies and consumers can benefit from enhanced integration without artificial barriers. However, overlapping, contradictory and duplicative requirements create a burden and must therefore be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, effective consultation is key. We all have listened very carefully to all different stakeholders: industry, large and small; regulators; supervisors; investors; workers and consumers. We have taken their constructive ideas on board and we have listened to each other. There is broad support for our common approach; a degree of consensus which is so crucial at the start of a new phase.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally hope this convergence of thinking, the good contacts established and the open way of policy-making will guarantee a swift launch for our policy programme of ‘consolidation’ for the next five years. Effective delivery of our common programme must be <span class="italic">the </span>mandate of the European Commission and the European Parliament. This week’s adoption of Mrs Van den Burg’s report will therefore be an important step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought we worked well as a committee to reach a reasonable and balanced template for the future of Europe’s financial markets. The industry and all three European institutions have undergone a stressful five years of legislation in this area, and the most stressful stage, for the industry at least, is probably still to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is certainly not perfect, and it certainly does not please everyone. However, in our Group we are all agreed that breathing space is now required to see these 40-plus directives properly implemented by transposition into national legislation, and to build up experience of their operation. Furthermore, the industry needs time to digest these often substantial changes to its ways of doing business. This will inevitably take time: it would be foolhardy to rush into further changes until we see how these work out in practice. After completion of the few remaining Financial Services Action Plan matters, there may be one or two other areas which need legislation – asset management may be one. Nevertheless, the Commission and this House need to be very careful that any such legislation really is necessary, justified by cost analysis and can be delivered usefully. Whenever possible, non-legislative improvements would be our preferred route.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lamfalussy process has a key role in ensuring that the FSAP legislation works for the benefit of both financial services companies and their customers. It is vital that transposition be implemented on-schedule and accurately, and we will expect the Commission to keep an eagle eye on this, because we will be keeping our eagle eye on the Commission. We will not hesitate to use our rights of challenge under the Lamfalussy process if we see the need.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made major strides towards an integrated European financial services market. In time this will be of great benefit to our economic prospects by providing the competitive capital market that Europe needs and which we are striving to achieve. There are not many other projects that will contribute as much towards achieving the Lisbon goals. It is now our duty to see that these matters are honed and perfected as they come into operation. It is now our duty, the duty of the Commission and the duty of the Member States to see that the financial services industry is given our full support in providing the essential ingredients of a successful European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, if we want this strategy to succeed, we require financial markets capable of financing the needs of our economies. That is the challenge we face; that is why, for the past five years, we have been striving to implement this Financial Services Action Plan; and that is why we believe we must go forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have said it and many continue to say it: we require a break in legislation. Commissioner, I am aware of your attachment to this undertaking. Everyone agrees, however, that there are two or three issues that we will obviously need to take further. Amongst these issues, I note that Mr Purvis has just raised that of asset management. Allow me to mention two others with which you are well acquainted. First, the issue of the database and all the difficulties that lie in implementing a genuine database that respects consumers’ rights; that is one of the key elements if we want to see our efforts in this area crowned with success. After having legislated on investments, there then comes the issue of the post-market situation, which, I imagine, will keep us extremely busy in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I should like to make two observations. The first concerns the rights of this Parliament. We have accepted the Lamfalussy Process. Should this Parliament have a call-back right, we will require measures for implementing this right at level 2. In addition, we will need to monitor movements at level 3 because we are well aware that the situation could go adrift at that level, something we will need to be able to denounce when it occurs, if that proves necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word about the situation of the regulators, as this is a debate that we have not resolved entirely within our Committee. We are on track, picking up with the Himalaya Report. I should, however, like to point out to you what we learnt when we officially met the CESR and its officials for the first time, in Paris. They told us very clearly that if we want a regulation to be implemented on a European scale, it will take more than benchmarking between national authorities, as the effect of this alone will not produce a sufficient level of harmonisation between the powers of different national regulators during the step-by-step process we are in. That is an element that we must take into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far as one can tell from today’s standpoint, the financial services plan can be described as a success. The question now arises of whether it needs to be followed by a successor, a ‘Post-FSAP’, in other words. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered this issue in an own-initiative report. It is vitally important that this House should make its opinion known at this early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The European internal market in financial services is still a long way from being complete, lagging well behind the internal market in goods. What we do know is that it is particularly in the retail markets that much more remains to be done, while the question has been repeatedly raised as to whether the financial services industry might not be entitled to a break from regulation after making such efforts. It is also raised in the own-initiative report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, although the rapporteur has today answered it firmly in the negative.</p>
<p class="contents">The text agreed on by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is largely balanced, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, though, critical comments to make on two aspects of it. The first is that although the work of CESR is, in wide-ranging fields, doubtless something to be welcomed, it must comply with clearly-defined ground rules. There must be better consultation and interaction between CESR and the democratically-elected European Parliament; as its decisions have a considerable impact, the relationship with Parliament, which should be consulted in good time, should be a close one. Secondly, although the big banks are making the case for deliberate and far-reaching harmonisation, it still needs to be clarified to what extent this applies to all sectors of the financial services industry. The Commission should give some thought to this. In this connection, the Liberals and Democrats support the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is open to various interpretations.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we can endorse most of the rapporteur’s amendments, and I extend warm thanks to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has put in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, a committee of wise men was set up on the regulation of European securities markets. What wisdom did it bestow? A four-level regulatory approach and the creation of two more committees! Then the Commission appointed four expert groups to mark the first step in the action plan review process. That was in October 2003, long before all of the action plan had even been implemented. If that were not enough, there was input from a monitoring group and four other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Who said ‘when in doubt, hold a committee meeting’? Only a report from an EU institution could say with such a straight face that this is a powerful recipe for success, at least in terms of delivering legislation. The EU is very good at churning out laws: <span class="italic">that</span> is transparently obvious. However, I have a warning for ordinary people out there in the real world, like those in our visitors’ gallery: it is transparent to me that more regulation is coming, thus there will be more laws to break; there will be more interference in pensions and insurance matters; more European-level supervisory bodies that will override national ones; and more back doors through which the EU intends to interfere in national taxation policy. The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements. In the real world, this would be seen as a work of fiction, not a serious proposition.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the EU confuses itself, but in the confusion, I should like to repeat one transparent certainty: if the EU is the answer, it must have been a very silly question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Operations on the world financial markets and, in particular, trade in derivatives recorded a literally explosive growth in recent years. Their volumes and growth of dynamics exceed many times those of classical financial operations involving real production, services and consumption of products. Any fluctuation in or, at worst, a collapse of even one part of these markets may have serious consequences for the world economy, not to speak of the fact that every negative development on financial markets has repercussions for personal finances and fates of ordinary citizens. In this regard, I appreciate the presented material and good work of rapporteur Ieke van den Burg as another contribution to devising a conceptual solution in this field not only within the European Union, but with the ambition of an intercontinental approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has produced a balanced text that takes a look at the European internal financial market – to which, over recent years, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has devoted a great deal of attention – and, while doing a good job of analysing our present situation, also looks towards the future.</p>
<p class="contents">To be sure, having had a great deluge of legislation, we must now consolidate; we must ensure not only that it is properly implemented, but also that we learn from our initial experience with it, and that we tackle the next legislative project piece by piece rather than with gusto, as we did before. We should also – contrary to what certain participants in the European market would like us to do – handle the topic of maximum harmonisation with a great deal of care. I can imagine those who currently write to us demanding maximum harmonisation in consumer protection matters saying – yet again – that we are taking harmonisation too far with the Consumer Credit Directive; that is why they should be very careful when calling for such a thing.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has, for some time, been quite clear about where it stands on CESR; although we are in favour of the Lamfalussy procedure, we want transparency and participation, and there is a very, very great deal of room for more of that in CESR. Our expectation is that what happened with ‘Clearing and Settlement’ will not be allowed to recur. I also call on Commissioner McCreevy to apply the same sensitivity to pressing for international standards in a field in which international bodies keep introducing more and more standards for large companies, which are then applied by small and medium-sized enterprises as well. This is where democratic control is called for, and this is where the Commission and Parliament must join together in developing the institutions for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end with a comment on European supervision. I regard the approach taken by ‘Basel 2’ – that of approaching this with very great care – to be the right one for a draft. We should take care not to be too hasty in creating a Europe-wide level playing field, thereby ignoring the regional and national level playing fields that we already have. The one must not wreck the other. That is why I favour a bottom up approach, so that, while focusing on European regulation and supervision, we build them up slowly, starting from the bottom. That this should be enforced from the top down is intolerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP), adopted in 1999 and strengthened at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, is an indispensable tool. It is now universally acknowledged that the FSAP has been a success, given that 39 of the 42 legislative measures have been adopted. It is premature, however, to issue a definitive verdict, because many of these measures have yet to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts must now, therefore, be channelled into ensuring that the necessary implementing measures are transposed into national law, and, in particular, that the operation is monitored, transparently and effectively, for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring the FSAP will enable us to gauge the impact of the legislation on the smooth running of European financial markets and on the development of promotional, supervisory and anti-discriminatory measures. Monitoring of this kind should be an urgent priority for the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the various points raised by the rapporteur, in compliance with the proposed guidelines, I should like to highlight, if I may, in view of its major importance, the call for the Member Sates to transpose, quickly and effectively, the directive on Occupational Retirement Provision, so as to increase the opportunities and alternatives for savers and offer them the best possible return on their investments. The overriding message of this report is that the Member States must adopt ‘the principles of better regulation’, opportunely adopted by the Commission, and that there must be greater convergence of national supervision practices relating to the measures incorporated in the FSAP.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to highlight the point that any future legislative measures aimed at remedying market failures must include a cost-benefit analysis of implementing them, in comparison with not implementing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van den Burg’s report addresses the whole question of financial services sensibly, coherently and intelligently and I therefore feel that Parliament should support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While talking about the integration of financial markets, we have to consider several aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the recommendations of Parliament concerning improvement of these market activities are important not only for professionals, but also for every citizen of the European Union, and we often forget that. In one way or another, by obtaining insurance policies or using bank services, we all participate in the financial market. In addition, to take account of the investments into the market of the pension funds would lead us to understanding that lately the quality of life is increasingly dependent on the activity of the financial market; in case of disorderly performance of at least one institution, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of citizens can suffer losses. However, effective management of the financial market cannot be achieved by implementing a particular regulation, since I can tell you from the experience in my country that such administration is costly, hard to implement, and, after all, does not protect investors and merely restricts market development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot expect progress within the European single market if the national legislation differs. We have to provide conditions for the inflow of capital to the European market from different countries of the world, and this capital cannot come because of the national barriers in the European financial market. Therefore, great attention has to be paid to the national legislation that has an impact on the financial markets; also activities of various working groups have to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, current regulation of the financial market lacks completeness and is fragmentary, and I do not approve the suggestion to stop adoption of new legislation regulating the activity of the financial market. I think it is important to replace fragmentary laws with all-inclusive and well-drafted directives. Otherwise, local institutions will initiate those legal acts, as it happens in the case of clearing and settlement. Therefore, we have to create favourable conditions in Europe not only for big players, but also leave some room for the activities of national businesses (small companies) and individual citizens at the national level. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been a very great deal of legislative activity in recent years – in my view, almost too much. I should like to say that the costs to the financial sector of transposing all these new laws is quite high and is growing. Just introducing the whole of the Basel II Directive is costing the banks a very great deal of money. I therefore wish to limit legislative ambitions in future and slow down the process to some extent. For example, I welcome the fact that we did not come up with legislative proposals in the area of clearing and settlement. Competition should be allowed to operate. There is no risk of monopoly. Technical development is taking place so quickly that competition from new players is breaking down the old monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">One area in which I definitely do not want to see new legislation is that of corporate governance or the way in which companies are run. Allow the market to be self-regulating in this area. If Germany wants its own rules for corporate governance, it should be allowed to have them. If Britain wants its own rules, it too must have them. The financial market will in time decide which system inspires greatest confidence. It will attract investors’ interest. I believe in institutional competition. There should be no devising of a common code, regulated by some directorate of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Too much legislation will lead to rigidity in the system. What has once become law becomes almost impossible to change. There is a great risk of our obtaining a financial market full of legal disputes, proceedings, advisory court judgments and yet more legislative measures to plug the gaps in the legislation. The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the gateway to a suffocatingly legalistic system. Scope should be provided for the mutual recognition of each others’ systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for supervising the financial market should not fall mainly to the EU. Instead, better cooperation between the local, national supervisory bodies is needed. I do not wish to see a new super-finance inspectorate in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People believed they could increase their own wealth quite quickly, only to wake up filled with utter bitterness.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two suggestions to make. Here is the first. Is it not possible that the EU institutions might explain to the European public, in very comprehensible terms, precisely what, in the way of such instruments, is currently available, at the same time assessing the risks involved in them? Secondly, can we not follow the example of the USA, which is now, at least, bringing transparency and a whiff of control into the world of hedge funds? Europe is in urgent need of it. Hedge funds are the ones that pull out the lot, the ones whose enormous leverage can achieve some massive dividends, but also massive losses, and which, in fact, over and over again, move the whole of Europe’s economic structure in their direction. That, I think, is something we should tackle as a matter of priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, in its capacity as a prime mover of Community legislation, it is vital that the Commission concentrates on non-legislative means to carry out measures in the financial markets wherever possible. Apart from legislation currently under way, rigid laws should be considered only when absolutely necessary, i.e. after a comprehensive impact analysis shows that the intended objectives cannot be achieved through non-legislative means. This approach should take due account of evolving market practices and the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in its role as EU executive, the Commission should take a rigorous approach to enforcement. Thirty-nine out of the 42 FSAP measures have been adopted. However, many implementing measures have not, and transposition into national law is only beginning. The Commission should start a benchmarking review of implementation in the Member States with the aim of completing the EU financial architecture as agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">The pace of integration in the financial markets has been far better than in many other areas. Much of this is due to the expediency and flexibility inherent in the Lamfalussy Process. As we move beyond the FSAP, however, the process itself should take into account the new environment in order to ensure that the appropriate balance of legislative and horizontal measures, structures of transparency, parliamentary control and stakeholder consultation improves further. For instance, structured dialogue between the EU and the US and other global capital markets could thus be better fed into the process, thereby strengthening both the European financial playing field as well as these relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the convergence between supervisory practices, we need to be realistic. The report before you sets out a useful strategy for creating lead supervisory practices in the EU. With a longer term perspective, provided that the parliamentary accountability of any new body thus created is guaranteed, we can see the benefits of moving towards a more uniform supervisory regime for financial markets. One possible option is a 26th European regime for supervision of global actors. All these options should be left open and used if the Commission thinks it is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me say, secondly, that the action plan for financial services in the period up to 2005 is a success; with 39 out of 42 measures already having been adopted, it is a success on the road that leads to the internal financial market, and it is successful as a result of the work Parliament has done. Necessary although these measures are, there are too many people who regard the great number of new and necessary regulations as excessive. They are wrong to do so, for the package of measures needs to be implemented in a very short space of time, and the internal market is not yet complete.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us consolidate instead of over-regulating, and implement instead of making excessive demands. When, moreover, we assess the way we implement these regulations, we have to ask ourselves three questions. What added value has the European Action Plan provided for the European Union? What problems have become apparent? What action do we need to take? The answers to the last question are obvious: as yet, not all the Member States of the European Union have the euro as their common currency; that weakens the internal market. Fiscal policy is dealt with at the national level and requires unanimity; that weakens the internal market. Cross-border payment transfers are not yet fully developed. Basel 2 is not yet in force, and ‘Clearing and Settlement’ is waiting to come in. Our problem is supervising the national supervisory authorities and getting them to cooperate with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are in favour of Lamfalussy, it must not be allowed to result in a loss of democratic control, of democratic legitimacy and of clarity in the reaching of decisions and the formation of opinion. The time for action to be taken is dependent on when we will have completed implementation and know precisely what steps we next have to take together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as I indicated earlier, this report marks the start of a new era in financial services. I thank Mrs van den Burg for her very stimulating report and the considerable effort that has gone into producing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on this report and our consultation with other stakeholders, next week, on 3 May, I intend to present to the College of Commissioners a Green Paper on financial services policy for the next five years. I will present this paper to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in more detail on 9 May. The Commission’s Green Paper will be open for public consultation until 1 August. Our final policy conclusions, deriving from all this work, are planned for the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of issues were raised and I will try to respond to some of them. Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi referred to the ‘Himalaya’ report. The Commission thinks integration needs to be accompanied by matching supervisory structures: the more integrated the markets, the more integrated and convergent the supervisory structures must also be. For the time being, I consider the Lamfalussy structures to be sufficient, but they need to be closely and continuously monitored and adapted, or further developed if needed. Only after careful assessment might future initiatives be necessary, with strict application of the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers, including Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi, mentioned the so-called 26th regime. That regime may sound attractive in its simplicity, but in practice it will require some degree of harmonisation across the board, whether legal or in terms of tax, language, etc. The benefits of those 26th regime schemes remain to be proven, and reaching an agreement on optional European standards designed for only certain products will be difficult. However, I take note of the current debate and will respond to the call to explore such 26th regime schemes further, as explicitly expressed in the van den Burg report.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Berès mentioned retail markets. We agree that there are important barriers to integration of retail financial services markets. The integration of retail markets is complex and demanding. However, this should not be the conclusion but our starting point. Product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer protection, contract law, differences in consumption, culture or other economic or structural realities play a prominent role in the retail area and create considerable complexity for cross-border supply and demand. These barriers, however, have their origin in the fragmentation of the European market for historic reasons. The Commission does not accept the argument that, as European integration increases, this fragmentation is there to stay. In ten years from now, the retail market will look completely different to the market of today. Our role is to anticipate and facilitate this development and not shy away from new initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Purvis and Mrs Berès raised the question of asset management. We will look to act only after the issues have been identified and potential solutions found. Where objectives can be achieved by non-legislative action, we will obviously choose this route. We might also need to address this question of legislative changes if they present the only way to secure single market freedoms in the area of investment funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan raised a number of issues, including one on the standards issued on clearing and settlement. I must point out that the Commission is not bound in any way by the ESCB CESR standards, and any policy decisions which might be enshrined in a <span class="italic">possible</span> future directive on clearing and settlement will take precedence over the ESCB CESR standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan also raised the question of the democratic governance and political accountability of rule-setters. Last week I was in the United States. You will note that we are working hard to influence the reform process under way within the International Accounting Standards Board. We are looking carefully at the arrangements proposed for the International Accounting and Auditing Standards Board, which will elaborate national standards and auditing. During that recent visit to the United States, we made good progress in some of these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wohlin raised the question of the new framework for capital requirements. They offer a range of approaches. For those banks moving to the simplest approaches, the changes from the existing standards of Basel I are not huge, so the costs of implementation are reasonably small. Banks moving to more sophisticated approaches will have to spend more, but they will do so only if this is a sensible business decision and the benefits will outweigh the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Members raised other points, which I hope will be taken up in the time ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I refer to what I said earlier: there is a considerable degree of convergence between the thinking in the European Parliament, the Council, industry, consumers and the Commission. I am convinced the coming five years will be extremely challenging. As the foundations for good collaboration between the institutions have been laid, I am sure we will be successful.</p>
