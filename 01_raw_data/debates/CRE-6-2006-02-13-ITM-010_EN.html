<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Afghan Circle in the European Parliament, I know the problem faced by the leaders of Afghanistan, whom I have met many times, with over 60% of their economy being dependent on the poppy. The countries of the region came together for the first time at the London conference to offer support to Afghanistan. Regional cooperation is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The distinguished Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Mr Tokaev, for example, said that Kazakhstan is funding a programme which provides Afghan farmers with alternative seeds, equipment and advice on growing alternative crops. Others are doing the same and, as you know, Britain is playing a leading role in the war against drugs.</p>

<p class="contents">We, the Socialists of the new Member States, have always supported the integration of those arriving from third countries. However, we cannot accept a situation where they are in a more favourable position on the labour market than the labour force of the new Member States. Post-enlargement labour market movement statistics do not justify the fear of social dumping. The Commission report, accepted on 8 February, states that the positive effect of labour force movement is a decisive factor. However, the Austrian Presidency still supported the extension of restrictions. The task of the European Parliament is to represent all European citizens. Therefore I call upon all my colleagues in this House to engage in a process of joint thinking, so that we can eliminate this contradiction as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know what is behind this tragic situation: unreasonable free trade agreements, like the ones concluded as recently as November 2005 with the United States, South Africa and so on, that is to say with countries in which the climate and the environmental, social and fiscal conditions are different to our own.

The act unilaterally concedes Italian citizenship to the descendants of the citizens of the two countries who have resided in the territories that Italy ceded to the former Yugoslavia under the provisions of the Peace Treaty of 1947 and the 1975 Treaty of Osimo. This introduces a kind of reoccupation of the territories over which Italy, as a defeated power of the Berlin-Rome Axis, definitively lost its sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the entirety of the European peace arrangement after the Second World War, the said act represents a threat to peace and security in Europe.

<p class="contents">This week will see us voting on the Services Directive, which may well, when transposed, bring 600 000 new jobs, 100 000 of them in Germany, my own country, providing that it is adopted in the form that has emerged from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. There is now no more than an infinitesimal prospect of this actually happening, since the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has caved in and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has got its way right down the line.</p>
<p class="contents">That has had no impact on the trade unions, who are continuing to spread untruths and panic. We expect, tomorrow, the arrival of 30 000 well-organised, well-fed and well-clothed people, who will be demonstrating against the creation of 600 000 jobs. Those who have work are fighting to keep it for themselves; that is immoral and unacceptable.

In the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland there is a high preponderance of conacre lettings, whereby an active farmer rents land for ten months each year from an inactive landowner.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Regulation (EC) No 782/2003 – as it is being implemented – the landowner and the active farmer cannot share the single farm payment relating to that land. That has resulted in duplicate claims for the same land by both tenant and farmer. Now both face the penalty of total non-payment. Confusion and error, rather than fraud, is the predominant cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The threatened withholding of the entire single farm payment is wholly disproportionate and potentially ruinous for many. I therefore call upon the Commission to sanction an approach capable of delivering a solution and securing the purpose of single farm payments, namely a fair standard of living for farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sea’s ecosystem is threatened by 292 000 tonnes of chemical weapons. The Baltic Sea is not a lake in the German or Russian interior. Its shores are home to the citizens of another six EU states, for whom the sea is the source for making a living and for recreation. When the sea is used intensively for fishing and other economic activities, the laying of a gas pipeline and these chemical weapons become a concern for the international community. In order to avoid an ecological catastrophe in the Baltic Sea, I urge you to encourage the Commission to carry out an exhaustive investigation into the possible effects of the gas pipeline, which is viewed as a private commercial project, on the ecology of the Baltic Sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that Kosovo is lost for Serbia, not only because the Albanians, constituting the 90% majority of the population, do not want to live there, but also because this is also supported by several superpowers, including the United States of America and Great Britain. The European Union has not formulated its own position yet, although this should be considered a matter of urgency. My question is, if the international community grants Kosovo the right to break away, to become independent, why should it be given the entire region, even areas inhabited by Serbs? Why is the possibility of territorial division excluded right from the start? Why are the Albanians rewarded and the Serbs punished?

This report proves conclusively that concerns about opening up the labour market were unfounded. The scale of the influx of workers to the old countries is fairly small, and the countries that opened up their labour markets have benefited in many ways as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, despite these clear conclusions most of the remaining Member States still wish to retain the current restrictions for several years. Why, in the light of the findings of its own report and in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, is the Commission not taking a much stronger line in pressing for discriminating restrictions on access to the labour market in the remaining Member States to be lifted? I would also like to enquire why the retention of these restrictions is condoned. Not only do they run counter to the provisions of the Treaties and the spirit of European integration, but they are also slowing down the Union’s economic growth, making it less competitive and creating the conditions for aberrations such as undeclared labour and fictitious self-employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the Commission will make a determined effort to ensure these harmful restrictions are lifted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its outraged followers retaliated by burning flags and attacking the embassies of European countries. In addition, an Italian priest was murdered in Trabzon in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">This escalation of hatred and violence was triggered and fuelled by the liberal left-wing media who have long been attacking religions of all kinds. In the name of a false notion of freedom, we are witnessing the desecration of faith and God, beliefs sacred to millions of individuals. The media are trumpeting religious intolerance, moral nihilism and anti-culture before our very eyes. One person’s freedom ends where another’s begins. Freedom of expression in the media must not amount to infringement of the rights and freedoms of other people. Freedom does not insult, it does not despise anyone, it does not mock, it does not demean and it does not make fun of what is holy. Freedom equals respect for the dignity, convictions and lives of other people.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought to bear this in mind as we stand up to the increasing deterioration of Europe’s culture.
