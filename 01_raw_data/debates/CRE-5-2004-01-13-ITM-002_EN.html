<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herzog (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our vote on this report is eagerly awaited. Throughout this working year, I have experienced at first hand the vehemence and the passion of the political debate on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Before Maastricht, local and national authorities made their choices, and those choices coexisted comfortably with the Common Market. Since the advent of the single market, conflicts and concerns have been rife. The fact is that a solution to these problems is still being quite literally prevented by the existence of taboos. Some boast of a proud record of liberalisation. In the opposite corner are those who regard public service and competition as incompatible. Others – and I hope there will be many of us – believe that liberalisation has had both positive and negative effects, that a better balance needs to be struck between commercial and non-commercial principles in the substance of laws and regulations and that such a balance would enhance cohesion and efficiency. An objective assessment of the real situation is needed, because the conviction that the market does everything better is becoming an article of dogma and is dividing Europe into two camps. It seems crucial to me that the legislature should be committed to redressing the balance and reconciling these conflicting principles in accordance with the great tradition of European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of my honourable colleagues accept the idea of a balance but consider that the power to strike such a balance rests exclusively with the local, regional and national public authorities. I absolutely agree that the decision-making rights of decentralised administrative bodies should be defended and strengthened, but I am convinced that the market will steadily erode them unless the Union acts as a guarantor of these rights and takes its due share of responsibility. And indeed our Community would not really serve any purpose unless it also provided complementary services in domains such as education, rail transport or information. My colleagues have rejected this line of argument, but I stand by my view that subsidiarity and co-responsibility must go hand in hand. Throughout history, Europeans – be they Christians or Humanists, Liberals or Socialists – have deemed it essential to ensure that services of general economic interest were so organised as to foster the development of the individual and enhance life in society. Let us not fall short of those ideals. Let us strive resolutely to bridge the gaps that divide our national communities with regard to the ethics of universal access to services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the matter in hand, why a framework directive? Not for the sake of legislating, because we do more than enough of that. In this case it is necessary, however. It is time that the legislature itself interpreted the treaties instead of letting the Commission exercise all sorts of power – legislative, executive and judicial powers as well as powers of self-assessment. The Convention recognises our right to do so, having inserted a new article to that effect in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and the prevailing situation demands that we do so. Firstly, a legal framework must give services of general interest the status of a positive right in law rather than simply condoning the protection of such services as a derogation from the norm; rules governing the market and competition would then be bound to respect the status of these services. Secondly, there is a need to eliminate the profound uncertainty about the distinction between services of economic interest and those of non-economic interest. Key areas such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and there is a need to recognise the increasingly numerous hybrid situations in which social, economic and environmental factors are intertwined. Accordingly, my proposals are designed to provide local authorities, non-profit businesses, semi-public companies and public-private partnerships with a general framework of more solid guarantees within which they can develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a need to clarify the principles relating to funding and organisation. The Altmark judgment on state aid is a step forward, but it leaves serious question marks about the calculation of costs, while care must also be taken to avoid criminalising public operators. Fourthly, we want a pluralist and independent evaluation method to be established. To reject it would be an affront to democracy. Let me add that a framework directive would certainly be consistent with the sectoral directives.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission to respond quickly to the results of the consultation process it has launched and to the parliamentary vote by answering this question: what commitments is it prepared to make with regard to the legal framework, funding and evaluation? Moreover, we refuse to accept the use of Article 86(3), which gives us no right of codecision, in its response to the Altmark judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to offer my very sincere thanks to the numerous associations, NGOs, trade unions, local-authority networks and businesses which were consulted and whose opinions enlightened and assisted me. Like the elected politicians, they want to have the legitimate means to express themselves far more on the policies and rules of the Union. Let me also thank my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have shown great commitment, and particularly those who have been seeking compromises. Regrettably, a majority said no to a framework directive and no to a democratic evaluation. By so doing, they not only rejected my proposals and our compromises; they quite simply turned their backs on the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2001. Tomorrow, the House can reaffirm its endorsement of that resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that many of you, whether on the Right or the Left, are pledged to defend and promote services of general interest. For this reason, I strongly urge you not to retreat into party or national blocs but to make up your own mind on each amendment, on each article, motivated only by the general interest of the European people.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, may I begin by thanking this House and especially Mr Herzog, your rapporteur, for the remarkable efforts you have devoted to this complex and delicate issue that the Commission raised in its Green Paper on services of general interest. The Commission believes that public services are at the heart of the debate on the future of the European integration process. Every country of the Union has public services which are rooted in unique traditions and situations, particularly those of a local nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard the services of general interest as a vital component of the European social model. We believe that these services contribute to people’s quality of life and to the competitiveness of our industries and that they help to strengthen our social and territorial cohesion. This is equally true with regard to the future Member States, because the efficient provision of services of general interest is one of the keys to their smooth integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Green Paper of last May, the Commission undertook its first full re-examination of Community policies on services of general interest. This review was essential, particularly in the light of your own demand, stated in the Langen report of 2001, which had initiated a debate on the question whether a general legal framework should be created at the Community level for services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time we are in the process of finalising our analysis of the contributions received in the course of the public consultation. We have now received almost 300 contributions, many of which are very substantial, and they obviously merit detailed study. It would therefore be premature at this stage to draw precise conclusions from this work. We do, however, intend to formulate political conclusions before the effective end of this legislative term, thereby responding, in fact, to a unanimous request from your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is undoubtedly a need to decide on the type of instrument that the Commission will be able to propose as a means of ensuring that Europe enjoys high-quality public services. One of the options that can be considered is a framework directive enshrining a number of common principles: equality of user access, universality, continuity, adaptability and evaluation. I am aware that this has been the subject of lively debate here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration can also be given to the adoption of a White Paper, pending the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains what we regard as several steps forward on this point. In the meantime, a White Paper could define the political framework for our future activity or else provide a road map for the pursuit of the sectoral approach.</p>
<p class="contents">To supplement these efforts, we are continuing our work on other matters relating to services of general interest, and particularly the application of the rules governing state aid, in the wake of the Altmark judgment. Clear messages have emerged from the public consultation on this point. We need greater legal certainty in the domain of state aid, particularly a mechanism for exemption from notification with adequate coverage, given the number of cases that could potentially be affected by the application of the Altmark ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, our aim is to lay foundations that will enable the Community to play a more proactive role with a view to guaranteeing the provision of high-quality services of general interest to the public and to businesses. This approach will obviously have to take account of the subsidiarity principle, and our aim is to pave the way for the formulation of a coherent policy in favour of services of general interest within the Union, a policy that will provide the best possible elucidation of the relationships between the various tiers of government and of their respective responsibilities. Your resolution will be an essential and indispensable contribution to the definition of this approach, which is why the Commission awaits the outcome of your vote with eager interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to express my regret at the result of the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which rejected the basic proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach which we adopted jointly with the rapporteur does not turn a blind eye to the problems raised by the current situation. The vital question is not who owns services of general interest. It is clear that current developments allow the private and public sectors to work together. However, in order to avoid privatisation having a negative character, the basic rules governing the mission of services of general interest, including their basic operating and funding principles, need to be respected. Among other things, it is important for care to be taken in all cases to satisfy the needs of the entire populace. That is why the principles of universality, continuity, affordability and quality need to be guaranteed at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference between ours and a liberal perception is that privatisation is not an end in itself and that it must not under any circumstances mean full dependence of services of general interest on market rules, as any such dependence would reach the point of even precluding funding by local authorities of services of general interest which serve local society. With certain services in particular, such as health, education and social services, the national authorities must have the right to lay down the rules which govern the provision of these services by private, profit-making agencies. I therefore call on the House, especially those who believe in the European social model as part of the European productive system, to vote for the amendments relating to what I have just said.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution will be a balanced resolution if we accept the compatibility of the rule of competition with the mission of the social state. Furthermore, the proposal to adopt a framework directive should be accepted, as it was in the previous resolution by Parliament. If we want to ensure that the basic requirements of the working classes as a whole are satisfied, we must all work to safeguard the future of services of general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What I am saying now I say on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which, by a large majority, made a recommendation practically all of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took on board, and whose first basic premise is that definition is a matter for the Member States. Rather than there being any need for a European model, it is the Member States or the sub-levels acting on their behalf that are competent in these matters. Secondly, the debate in which we are engaged is not about tampering with the efforts at liberalising certain sectors; on the contrary, we believe that this liberalisation in the internal market has, as a whole, albeit with some exceptions, been very successful and that it must not be jeopardised by European framework legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we discussed the legal framework. On 13 November 2001, we called for a framework directive on the basis of the article on the internal market. There have to date been no indications whatever of this being possible, which is why most of our group have changed their position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, you have just given us a wonderful list of the options that are available – framework directive, White Paper, guidelines, exemption from notification and so on – but all that must be coherent. We have been discussing the topic for over three years, and the Commission was previously unable to give us chapter and verse concerning the various legal options available to us. Pleasing though what you have told us today has been to the ear, I do not believe that the Commission has finished its homework. Not the least reason why we have been debating this for so long is we have hitherto had only lists of issues, but no solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that our group takes the line that the Green Paper must as soon as possible be succeeded by a White Paper in which the Commission will at last come clean, elaborate on the legal issues involved in a framework directive, and clarify what the potential options are. Having already spent two years waiting for this, we can do no other than encourage you, as soon as possible after the decision on Wednesday, not only to get started on it, but also to put some concrete proposals before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make is that water supply and individual regions are contentious issues. There are of course some local services that must continue in future to be offered by the responsible authorities at the local level. We are not interested in liberalising markets that are unsuited to liberalisation, but we are saying that each can decide whether something is to be done on an independent basis or whether it should be handed over to someone else. If, though, it is to be handed over to a third party, it must be put out to tender, so that the contract is awarded in an honest and transparent manner. That is the consensus to which we have come, and I hope that, having formed our opinions today, we will be able to adopt the whole Herzog report tomorrow.</p>

I am reminding the House of this fact because I believe that a link exists between the difficulties we experienced, during the debate on the draft constitution, in reaching agreement on the recognition of a positive right to services of general interest and its enshrinement in European law and the considerable obstacles which we have encountered – and which our excellent rapporteur, Mr Herzog, certainly had to confront in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in trying to advance this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I believe it would be extremely prejudicial if this report were less ambitious than the compromise – insufficient though it was, it did constitute an improvement – which we obtained in the framework of the debate on the draft Constitution. It would be difficult in these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, to convince people that we are representing them properly, because I am not the only one who perceives a firm belief in the public mind that European integration will mean more services, better services, more protection, more safety – food safety, maritime safety, security in the widest sense – in this high-risk society. Broad-based movements within our European societies today are also voicing clear demands for the effective exercise of citizens’ social rights – the right to education, culture, health care, environmental protection, clean water and clean air as well as rights of access to housing, transport, communication, information, energy supplies, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, all of us – I hope – are convinced that these services are essential, but I have the impression that some Members of this Chamber are doggedly determined to reinstate scurrilous paragraphs which effectively detract from Mr Herzog’s excellent work. For example, they emphasise the inestimable benefits of liberalisation, but they will not manage to convince us, for the market cannot provide all of these services in accordance with the principles of equal accessibility and universality – hence the absolute necessity of a recognised positive right to services of general interest. This being the case, I hope that the amendments you vote to adopt tomorrow will rid us of a document which, in its present form, is extremely compromising for our European Parliament and will seriously undermine the dialogue in which we shall be engaging over the coming months with the people of every European country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank Mr Herzog and say that, while it is unfortunate that too few of his good ideas have found their way into this draft, we may perhaps be able to make some corrections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did indeed, with the support of votes from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, opt for European framework legislation, and our committee takes the view that services of public interest are something special; they are a characteristic, a distinguishing mark of the European social model, and that is something that we wanted the report to make abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, for example, consider the postal service. We are not opposed to liberalisation measures, far from it; our committee, too, has prepared them in various sectors. We know, however, how important it is for many people in Europe that there should be in their neighbourhood a post office – ‘office’ is perhaps the wrong word – a postal facility. That also plays a part in the European public’s satisfaction with public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Alternatively, let us consider local transport. A majority in this House has rejected the Commission’s proposals for liberalisation – which I would describe as pigheaded – and the Commission is now finding it extremely difficult to come up with new ones, our view having been that public passenger traffic cannot be seen in black and white in the same way as trans-European freight transport or air travel, and that there are special interests involved in it, including regional ones. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is therefore also of the opinion that local and regional authorities in particular must have greater freedom, the freedom to define. The fact is that this also plays a part in democratic politics, as the public, if they are dissatisfied with the services, can respond accordingly by voting certain towns’ governments out of office and other parties into it. It is especially in the provision of public services that this democratic element should not be overlooked, and so I hope that the Herzog report will enable even more to be done to strengthen social cohesion in Europe.</p>

Although our different views on policy made working together difficult, we managed together to get the report underway.</p>
<p class="contents">How did we first get on to this topic? The Commission alone possesses decision-making powers in respect of services of general interest – it has had in recent years an increasing tendency to take up these matters – and also as regards lawmaking in connection with competition law. Particularly with the constitutional treaty in mind, we were of the opinion that this was an area in which Parliament should gain greater competence. It was for that reason that we, too, originally favoured a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">When debating the framework directive, though, we certainly have to ask ourselves questions about its substance too. Can we resolve the problems with competition law? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to the conclusion that the framework directive was inherently unsuited to doing that. The fact is that those who advocate it must ask themselves, over and over again, what a framework directive of this sort is meant to contain. Underlying the debate on services of general interest is, on the one hand, European law on competition in the internal market, and, on the other, the way in which ‘services of general interest’ are defined, by way of subsidiarity, in the Member States or even at the regional and local level. Not under any circumstances do we want services of general interest defined at European level in the future, be it in a framework directive or in the constitutional treaty. We are in favour of competence and responsibility at the local level, where competition can be introduced through tendering, in cooperation with the private sector. The EU of the future, though, with its 25 Member States, will be too diverse for us to lay down at the European level what this expression means. That is why we say ‘no’ to a framework directive and ‘yes’ to local competence, particularly when it comes to the supply of water. This is where the Commission should start by putting before us evidence for competition being a good thing in postal services, public local passenger transport and in other areas such as energy. It is particularly with France in mind that much lost ground has to be made up, and you, Commissioner Lamy, should resolve these problems before tackling any new projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rapkay (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not for the first time, but yet again, the debate on the Green Paper shows that services of general interest, the way in which they are provided and structured, are more than ever in the spotlight, not only in terms of political debate but also of the European public’s concerns about universal access to services. For us in this Group of the Party of European Socialists, they are an indispensable component of any model of European society – I will explicitly use the word ‘component’, as this is not about developing a European model for services of general interest; they are an essential and elemental component in a European social model with objectives common to all European societies. They play a crucial part in improving the quality of life for all citizens and in overcoming economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where I want to attempt to clear up a misunderstanding. This is not about our having the market and competition on the one hand and services of general interest on the other. Services of general interest can perfectly well be provided by market instruments in a competitive context, but we have to take note of the fact that there are also situations in which the market does not provide such services efficiently, and that is when the democratic community has to be able to ensure that such services can be provided outside the market’s machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">This interaction highlights our need for a bit more legal clarity. That is why our group endorses the rapporteur’s thinking on this, and this is where I too want to extend warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who really has done everything possible to bring about compromise; even though he is the rapporteur, he has changed his position in essential areas, and I think it is rather a pity, in view of this achievement, this attempt at consensus, that there are elements in this House that have quite simply refused to give him credit for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the report because we need it if we are to have legal certainty and a common legal framework within which these issues can be dealt with, but, above all else, we want Parliament to have a part in it, and on that point I want to say something in response to Mr Langen’s statement that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, in the meantime, come to an agreement that they do not want a framework directive after all, on the grounds that Article 95 does not allow it. I do not see that such is the case at all; you decided that you did not want one, and the reason why you did so was that a majority of you no longer saw it as politically acceptable. For whatever reasons you did this, we can understand them, we can live with them, but please do not try to tell me that it cannot be done for lack of suitable legal basis. That has never bothered us before, and quite right too; when we wanted to get something done politically, we found the legal basis for doing so, and, as the Commission is a veritable master at doing this sort of thing, now is the time for us to support it in finding one. There is absolutely no doubt about the fact we want it, but Parliament’s right of codecision must be safeguarded if we do.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, a legal framework of this sort needs to contain some substance, and I urge that we should, in future, spend more time discussing substance than this or that legal basis. That is what our debates should be about; there is a whole range of items that have to be embedded in a framework of this sort, and I want to list just six of them. As I have already said, the framework directive must aim to give the stakeholders legal security when current Community law is applied to what they do. There is, quite clearly, no disagreement about the fact that the actual definition, structure, organisation and funding of services of general interest lie within the remit of the Member States and their sub-divisions – that is, of course, the municipalities, where these have the relevant competence. It follows that it is not worth working towards a uniform and all-embracing European definition, but there are a number of standards and a few criteria that of course amount to the same thing and that also have to be embedded in it. Universality, for example, is one of them, as are also continuity, the quality of the service, efficiency, affordability and also the involvement of the users and the democratic supervision of the service providers. Far more than was the case in the past, we have to concentrate on the actually essential point: when is an activity economic and when is it not? That is the yardstick by which we determine whether or not the rules on competition or the internal market should apply, and I see this as the area in which we should pursue the debate. So, the situation being as it is, we say ‘yes’ to a legal framework of this kind, and let us discuss its substance rather than any legal bases.</p>

I am, however, very pleased about the discussions to which this report has led, with their focus upon a list of important issues concerning services of general interest. It has been a refreshing political discussion, reflecting the political differences in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to express support for the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. For the ELDR Group, it is important to emphasise that the liberalisation already implemented by a range of sectors has generally been a great success. It has meant the creation of approximately one million new jobs and, in particular, better service for less money. At the same time, the issue of whether or not Parliament should demand a framework directive has been of crucial importance to the ELDR Group’s support for the present report. I should like to emphasise that the ELDR Group does not support a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of a horizontal directive would be to freeze a number of areas which, as we know by experience, develop the whole time. There is absolutely no need for this at a time when we in Europe are already lagging behind with economic reforms. On the contrary, we should support further liberalisation, but on equal conditions. This must, however, take place via sectoral directives of the kind of which very successful use is already being made in a number of sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ELDR Group, we are, as I say, convinced that it will be neither possible nor desirable in a framework directive to establish any usable definitions of services of such different kinds as are at issue in this House, at the same time bearing in mind the large regional and national differences that exist in the area of services of general interest. We recognise, however, the doubt and uncertainty to which what is termed the Altmark judgment, concerning the funding of locally based services of general interest, has led. We therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission’s reflections concerning a legal initiative to clarify this issue. Nor, as I say, do we think, however, that a framework directive would be of any help in this context. If it were a question of a legal initiative, we should, however, greatly regret the fact that the existing Treaty does not give us in the European Parliament power of codecision concerning such an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">To dispel any doubt, I should like to emphasise that our opposition to a framework directive does not in any way mean that we in the ELDR group want the duty to supply certain services of general interest to disappear. On the contrary, we believe that such a duty could easily go hand in hand with liberalisation and, for example, environmental requirements, if only the political authority were to require this. Responsibility for demanding quality lies, of course, with the political authority, which must also ensure that the demands are complied with. I want us to obtain more value for money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">The text has become an ode to liberalisation with one single aim in mind, namely to make competitive market forces the sole regulator of service provision. Recital H, for example, emphasises that liberalisation in leading sectors in the internal market is a factor in technological progress and economic efficiency, while paragraph 13 welcomes the liberalisation that has taken place in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the moderate proposal calling on the Commission to perform without delay a precise and comparative evaluation of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking upon further liberalisation, a proposal contained in the Langen report which was approved by this very House, is not endorsed in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">On spurious pretexts, the report also discards the aim of a framework directive in which services of general interest and the obligations they entail for governments as well as for public and private operators could be defined more precisely. Only basic education and social protection would remain in the public sector. This is far removed from the sort of approach that is absolutely essential for the protection of people’s fundamental rights to energy and water supplies, transport, housing, communications and information.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of services of general interest should be to guarantee these rights in accordance with a number of principles, namely equal access for everyone, information, consultation, user and worker participation and financial viability. It is impossible to achieve this ambition by relentlessly continuing to pursue the sole aim of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This text is unacceptable as it now stands. The hopes and expectations aroused by the Green Paper were that public services would play a pivotal role in guaranteeing economic, social and environmental rights, that the true ambition of Europe was to satisfy the needs of the greatest number in a society characterised by solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from these remarks that my group will support all the amendments that are designed to remove the constantly recurring references to liberalisation and those which strengthen a model of services of general interest that are worthy of the name. My group reaffirms the need for an evaluation. It emphasises that services of general interest are elementary public services. It also expresses its desire to confirm unambiguously the right of local and regional authorities to choose freely the way they administer the services of general interest for which they are responsible. These things, at the very least, must be guaranteed if the services of general interest are to be an engine of solidarity in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As several speakers have already said, this report, compiled on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is essentially designed to clarify the terms of the debate and particularly to ensure that the opening of individual sectors of the economy to competition in the European Union is accompanied by greater legal certainty and is subject to funding guarantees and an evaluation requirement. Let me say that the Greens will support the amendments that have been re-tabled in plenary in order to return to the spirit of Mr Herzog’s original proposal. I should like to add two elements to the debate. Firstly, I must remind the House that the Convention also debated this issue and concluded that there was a need for a legal basis other than the one currently provided by the treaties. Accordingly, if the European Parliament, in tomorrow’s vote, were to come out against the position of the Convention, we should have an interesting conflict of political legitimacy between the two bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would add that, in the course of this debate, we ecologists have observed that there is a curious underlying alliance between the advocates of maximum subsidiarity – a precept, incidentally, that is also supported by Mr Herzog and our group – and those who believe that there must be no barriers at all to engagement in free competition. As a result of this alliance, there is basically no agreement within the European Parliament, just as there is no agreement in the Council, on the need to proceed towards framework legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">So I should simply like to ask the following question: when we have all delivered our speeches, who will be the winners in this debate? It clearly will not be the advocates of subsidiarity but rather the defenders of the right to engage in unbridled competition. The fact is that, month after month, we vote on sectoral directives, and we can see how difficult the Court of Justice finds it to justify the imposition of any obligation to provide services in the public interest. The result is the reinforcement of a European model which is largely based on tax, wage and welfare competition between locations. If we want to redress this imbalance to some extent, we really need greater legal certainty in order to guarantee the funding of services of general interest, however they may be defined by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I call on each of you to reflect on this dubious alliance between those who aspire to define services of general interest in their own countries and regions and those who swear by completely free competition with no holds barred. We agree with the former but urge them to dissolve their alliance with the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the report adopted had been amended to such an extent that nothing remained of the original proposal. It looks very much as though Mr Herzog has problems now, too, with the point of view of the majority in Parliament, which rightly opposes the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest. Even before the European Commission presented its Green Paper in May 2003, the rapporteur had presented a working document containing his views. That was too quickly and too soon to answer the questions that the Commission presented to Parliament in its Green Paper. It is regrettable that the Green Paper was not a visionary document, but the fact that the rapporteur already had a view on the Commission proposal before the proposal was made is downright premature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper rightly draws attention to the powers of national and regional authorities with regard to services of general interest. It is my firm belief, therefore, that it is a matter for national and regional politicians to take decisions on services of general interest. I do not see any need for granting the Commission new powers in this area, therefore. I can endorse the proposal adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, however, that the text that came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gives, in a way that is more in line with the current climate, an accurate picture of the situation and the prospects as regards services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Services of general interest make up a substantial part of the European economy, which is increasingly becoming an economy of services; liberalisation and competition, also within this extremely important sector, are essential to the dynamic nature of the European economy and its capacity to grow and create jobs. I believe that it would be a mistake to think that it is possible to set in stone the situation regarding the provision of services of general interest within the context of a framework directive or within new <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>legislation. It is not easy to define these sectors, which are sectors that are forever evolving: what today is a public service, may tomorrow be a sector in which providing products and services is completely assured by the market. It would be a mistake to enshrine this and set it in stone.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as is stated in Article 19 of the report, the current provisions for the internal market and competition ensure, in itself, that in this and other sectors, public measures, where necessary, are adopted within the context of the rules already laid down by the Treaties, guaranteeing that the economy providing public services is competitive and dynamic. Otherwise, there would be stagnation and the European economy would be in jeopardy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed through many discussions and many sound amendments so that, in the end, we have obtained a result from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that I think is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not well disposed towards a general framework directive. In my opinion, it would offer no advantages but, instead, be confusing. It would be like an extra layer of legislation between the internal market’s rules of competition and the sectoral directives, and it would also be an obstacle to product development. The process of gradual deregulation of the EU markets has been the most important component for improving services of general economic interest during the last decade. Another of the reasons for the deregulation has, of course, been the generally poor quality of the services before the market was opened. I am anxious that we should not again find ourselves in a monopoly situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to call upon Parliament to go with what came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stated in Mr Herzog’s report, and not to vote in favour of the amendments from the Left. If we go with the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we stimulate competition and product development and provide opportunities to offer consumers both cheaper and better alternatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that tomorrow Parliament will rectify matters by overturning the rejection of the framework directive proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This is not the end of the debate: this is a debate on a Green Paper and is the beginning of what I think will be a fairly long debate. Parliament is seeking, in this debate at least, to give some guidance to the Commission as to how it should proceed with regard to services of general interest, both economic and non-economic. For me the issue of general-interest services – both economic and non-economic – is a line in the sand between those who favour a social market economy model and those who favour a neo-liberal market economy. It is not acceptable that we should move by stealth to denying citizens their rights as citizens, which citizenship grants them in Europe, by making competition the only measure of service provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The OECD has estimated that in the 1990s governments in Europe transferred about EUR 300 billion of public-service property to private operators, in some cases with disastrous results in terms of both service provision and, indeed, loss of life. As a Union and a Parliament we have to stand by access for all to high-quality, affordable services, and we must recognise that those services dictate the quality of life of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress in Amsterdam, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the new draft Constitution on re-establishing the rights of citizens to public services. We must defend those rights. It is not a question of defending an <span class="italic">ancien régime</span>, but of looking to see how high-quality services to our citizens can be guaranteed across the board in what are new circumstances. In particular, we must defend the advances we have made in the constitution on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has given us a single large trading area without barriers, with 375 million consumers now, soon rising to 450 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years, the market has been increasingly extended into other sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy. The European market is a socially corrected free market, which means that the markets in these sectors have been opened up in a gradual, controlled – and successful – manner. This has resulted in greater competition and modern service provision that is of better quality and lower-priced. This liberalisation has by no means had any harmful effects, therefore, and the example must be an inspiration to other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission Green Paper is certainly not before time, and deserves particular credit. It is indeed necessary to examine whether we can apply the operation of the internal market and the opening-up of the borders to other services of general, and particularly economic, interest. What other possibilities are there for breaking state monopolies whilst continuing to guarantee that all citizens obtain the best service at an affordable price? I share the feelings of many others in thinking here of the water supply, waste management and even information sectors, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on this subject must be held not only here, however, but also with national or even regional authorities, which are now often responsible for managing these sectors. We must use the results of this wide-ranging, interesting and indeed already productive debate to examine whether, and if so how, European legislation can be of benefit, especially to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is one area in which opinion in this Assembly and general opinion throughout the EU is deeply divided, it is precisely this area. The problem is that we have legislation for the internal market that is in actual fact an invitation to unrestrained and unlimited competition where both goods and services are concerned. That is something we cannot live with. It is said that it is mainly a question of services of economic interest. Which services are not of economic interest? Is not the education sector of economic interest? Is not the health sector of economic interest? Are not all the social services of great economic interest? We are talking about welfare policy as a whole and about something that really is political dynamite.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a desire for balanced development and for stopping this general attack on the welfare sectors, what is to be done? Are we to pin our faith on a framework directive? I am a little unsure. In and for itself, a framework directive could place limits upon legislation governing the internal market. It would of course be good for calming things down and reducing the intensity of antagonisms. In the political climate of today and of the next few years, I am afraid, however, that such a framework directive would be heavily dominated by adherents of the market and by right wing forces. In that case, such a directive would be a step in the wrong direction and might instead become a trap.</p>
<p class="contents">Is decentralisation a better alternative? Is it better to focus upon protecting local and regional activities? It would perhaps open up certain other possible ways of securing a type of protection and increased opportunities for conducting a local campaign to protect what we wish to preserve. Above all, however, we need time for research and discussion as a counterweight to the giant battle we face over the next few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A recent UK parliamentary report on water privatisation has shown that many poorer people, such as pensioners, have had such difficulty in meeting their bills that they have been cutting their water use to a bare minimum. In some cases this has been described as verging on a public health crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The drive for privatisation has also been part of a drive to reduce costs in the public sector and this has often resulted in wage squeezes that have hit the lowest paid. The tab for that is still picked up by the public purse through effectively subsidising wages in that area. Those people may be on a minimum wage, but it is not necessarily a liveable wage. That is not to say that everything in the public sector has been perfect, but in our view a lot of the claims made for liberalisation in this report are highly questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group does not believe that general-interest services can be treated in the same way as companies which produce, for example, plastic key rings. It is not an area that should be subject to general competition policy and we have tabled amendments to that effect. We believe that competition rules need to give way to general-interest services, and not the reverse. We agree entirely with the Commission on the need for legal clarity. That is an issue we have often raised in connection with GATS and is the subject of an amendment we have tabled and for which we hope to win support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer to these excesses is to change the law or at least to make explicit provision for an unqualified derogation for public services.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim must remain an equally high standard of service for everyone, not the quest for profitability which would throw open these public services to competition. It is therefore dangerous to seek to establish a European definition of services of general interest. First of all, a coherent definition would be impossible in view of the diversity of territorial structures and national practices, and then the political will to formulate such a definition is lacking, as is even a simple majority in favour of definition. My group is in favour of deliberations that would culminate in the identification of the interests that are common to all European service users and of measures to guarantee the funding of the identified services. This Green Paper and this report, which proclaims the success of the liberalisation measures that have been taken to date, are very far from satisfying this need.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention’s draft Constitution, which the European Council rejected in Brussels, would not have changed anything, because it also subordinated services of general interest to competition law. A structure has been put in place, and its aim is clearly to dismantle the public services that exist in some of the Member States. The important thing for my group is that we should be able to discuss these things democratically with our peoples, recognising their ultimate right to choose the model they believe should be developed in order to guarantee the social and territorial cohesion of their respective countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we shall not endorse this report, although we shall, of course, vote in favour here and there to support the less distasteful proposals.

Numerous paragraphs are contradictory. For example, while paragraph 36 calls for the adoption of a framework directive establishing common European rules, paragraph 20 strongly condemns the selfsame approach.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part – and here we differ from the rapporteur – we believe that the framework directive, which was the idea of the last French Presidency, would only serve to divest the Member States of essential regulatory powers, as the services in question are closely linked to the unique character of each society. Moreover, it would be too generalised, would be inapplicable to any individual case and would create endless difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">These are very delicate problems and should be solved by each government at the closest possible level to the people in the framework of the national democratic system. In this respect I am, moreover, only half surprised that the Left is nailing its colours to the mast of centralisation and enforced uniformity here.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason we are opposed to Article III-6 of the draft European constitution, whereby European law, in other words the legislative decisions of the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament, would be able to define the principles and conditions applicable to services of general economic interest. If this article were adopted, it would very soon have adverse repercussions on the freedom of choice of our national democracies and on subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we had asked for something else, the Commission has responded to the Langen report by presenting us with this Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, who have approached this from many different angles in the course of the discussion process, for preparing, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a very good resolution, and one that is likely to get majority support now that it is to be voted on by plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the question arises of what services of general interest are. We take the term to mean services for the public that are provided in the interests of all. They are meant to provide services where the market alone cannot do so on a universal basis, at a reasonable price, or, in many instances, free of charge. Services of general interest ensure security of supply. Service providers may compete among themselves, but they do not have to. Support from public funds is required. What is crucial is not who provides the services but the fact that they are provided. Services of general interest are an expression of the European social model and of the ecologically-responsible market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">What was crucial for me was the safeguarding of the subsidiarity principle; I can endorse the Social Democrats’ Amendment No 18. I welcome the statement that the liberal professions perform services of general interest for the good of all, and I am glad that we have made it our concern that the definition of services of general interest and responsibility for them should be matters for the Member States rather than for Europe as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even if it is not taking place within the framework of a legislative process, our debate today is fundamental, because it deals with the borderline between the world of the market, where competition has to prevail, and that other world where solidarity, equality and democracy – in short, social cohesion – must be paramount. It is fundamental, because our European model, the envy of the world, and the most elementary civil rights, chiefly enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European population, among associations, trade unions and local authorities, there is grave concern, because the various experiences of liberalisation or privatisation – and I need only cite the British experience – have had rather adverse consequences. This is why we propose that the report, which is totally unacceptable in its present form, should undergo substantial amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we propose a thorough public, pluralist and open evaluation of the development of services of general interest, perhaps through an observatory of services of general interest. In actual fact, we find it difficult to understand the opposition of the Right to this proposal if, as its adherents loudly and proudly proclaim, the effects of liberalisation have all been beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the ambiguity of the criteria used to distinguish between economic and non-economic activities and to guarantee the subsidiarity that everyone is demanding, certain areas of activity – education, health care and social housing – will have to be explicitly excluded from the application of the competition rules. By the same token, there is a need to protect the right of municipalities and other local authorities to choose democratically the way in which they manage certain services – water and refuse disposal, for example – in accordance with local needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Member States and their territorial subdivisions and local authorities are, of course, responsible for services of general interest, hence the need for a framework directive which could truly establish a set of common principles for services of general interest. It is surely a matter of summoning up the will, at a given moment, to protect the citizenry of our countries. This is how one vision of Europe can be understood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The task of the Commission is to ensure that such services are facilitated and secured in local communities; it must defend services of general interest in the GATS negotiations, where it must ensure that local communities have room to manoeuvre, so that the public may be guaranteed these services in the interests of social justice, solidarity and territorial cohesion.

I believe we have to escape from this dilemma, but we must leave in an orderly manner by the front door. First of all, it is necessary to affirm the fundamental legitimacy of services of general interest. There is a set of public assets that must be organised more or less in the form of exemptions to the rules of the market, either because they need to be subsidised by the public authorities if everyone is to have guaranteed equal access to them or because the principle of equality is incompatible with excessive price fluctuations. There is therefore a need to reaffirm the axiom that we are in a market economy, not a market society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a legal framework is necessary, otherwise we should all have to give up our common ambition. This framework must begin by specifying where competence lies in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, in other words the level – European, national or local – at which services should be organised. The legal framework must also specify the scope of services of general interest – how far their definition may legitimately be extended. And, lastly, it must define the principles governing the way in which they are to be organised. In particular, care must be taken to ensure that no service of general interest is abused or becomes a monopoly, generating a secure income for those who provide the service rather than its beneficiaries. All these things have to be said.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the legal framework must be democratically structured. We in this Parliament cannot abdicate our responsibilities. We cannot be like the frogs who demanded a king. This is a matter that concerns the public, the peoples of Europe. Together with the Commission, we must establish a legal basis that enables us to set this issue within a democratic framework on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and with the Council and Parliament acting by codecision, otherwise we should be failing in our duty.</p>

What do the people of Europe remember about the EU in these past few months? They remember the division over foreign policy, they remember the split over budgetary policy, they remember the deadlock on the draft constitution, and they remember the feeling of impotence as they watched the dollar soar in value. If the social model were to be taken away from them, what would be left in the coming months? The social model is their one source of pride in Europe at the present time, and services of general interest are part of that social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is a fine thing, but we are not about to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the shareholders. We are not about to enshrine the principle of an all-powerful market which is familiar to those who live in the land of the Rockies, nor are we about to return to an all-powerful state, which used to be a familiar concept to those in the land of the Urals. Mr Herzog’s report and proposals strike the right balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to rediscover that harmony, that judicious compromise, especially for the sake of our fellow European citizens. There are strong points that must be built upon: the provisions of the draft constitutional treaty, the progress promised by the framework directive and the implications of appropriate guaranteed funding of services of general interest. There is a need to recapture the spirit that inspired Mr Herzog’s initial report before the committee began to chip away some of its substance. That spirit needs to be recaptured, particularly for the sake of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a period of economic crisis, the only thing that is certain is that big business will want to get its hands on the public wealth in order to maximise its profits. Undertakings of general interest, apart from their important role in the development of the national economy, also play a strategically important role with regard to the security and independence of each country, especially in times of economic and other crises. Privatising these undertakings and liberalising their markets will ultimately limit this development and will certainly enrich their shareholders instead of strengthening the national economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement that liberalisation is a factor of technological progress and economic efficiency is not true because, from experience with its practical application to date, it probably has the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Privatisation results in the destruction of productive forces, problematic performance, a fall in the quality of the services provided, terrible social inequalities, higher prices and fewer jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Privatisation has an adverse impact on workers, not just as a result of the increase in the prices of the services provided but also, more importantly, as a result of the waves of redundancies and the resultant replacement of the work regime with flexible forms of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Any restrictions placed on the action of big business in the services of general interest sector and any good intentions to guarantee certain principles which will govern operations and the services provided, even if applied initially, will subsequently degenerate, and the only victims will be the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the selling off of public wealth for the benefit of big business. We support the public character of undertakings of general interest, which need to be upgraded, providing good, cheap services to the workers, and to act as a lever in a publicly-owned economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diversity, to say the least, of the views they expressed did not surprise me, and I should not have intervened had I not perceived in Mr Langen’s contribution a somewhat critical attitude to the Commission on this issue, a suggestion that the Commission raised many questions but did not provide clear answers or, to be more precise, that it was slow in delivering clear legal responses. This is therefore the point that I should like to take a few moments to clear up between us.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission had been able to propose a clear legal response to you today, this would mean that a solution had been found to the problem we have been debating. In point of fact, the very purpose of the Green Paper we published last year was to open the broadest possible debate on a highly complex issue, and our feeling in the Commission is that a year is not an unduly long time for a debate with civil society, with you and with a number of representatives of economic and territorial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is indeed a difficult one, as our debate has shown. In political terms, this issue palpably centres on a specific European policy mix for which we all want to suggest a slightly different recipe, depending on whether our political preference is for the market economy, which we recognise for its competitiveness and efficiency, or for collectivist virtues in the domain of social or territorial cohesion. These are all dimensions of solidarity, but each of us has his or her own idea of the proportions in which the ingredients should be mixed.</p>
<p class="contents">In political terms, then, the problem is relatively clear, and I do not really distinguish any great differences between the various ways in which you have described the contours you would give these services of general interest, or public services, if they had to be more precisely defined at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty plainly relates to the way in which they should be defined. This remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture. Would what we are doing just now, with our sectoral directives and our decisions taken on a somewhat <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>basis on state aid, suffice as a legal framework? This is surely the question that is being asked. As you have pointed out, the Convention debated this point and concluded that it might be necessary to have a European law to provide the legal basis that is currently under discussion today in the context of the EC Treaty in its present form. This is certainly the question we must clarify.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my introductory remarks, the Commission is examining various options. To reassure Mr Langen, I repeat that, particularly in the light of the debate which will culminate in tomorrow’s vote on a resolution, the Commission will communicate its own positions before the end of this legislative term. Whether we come out in favour of an instrument which involves the European Parliament in codecision or whether our conclusions favour a different approach, I must stress on behalf of the Commission that all our options are still open at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The consequences of the liberalisations are already evident in the sectors affected, not only in the shape of redundancies and greater job insecurity, on the railways, in energy, postal services and telecommunications, but also, in some cases, in more expensive tariffs and prices and in lower quality of services provided.

<p class="contents">We insist that we should adopt proposals that promote the protection of public services and a democratic and pluralist evaluation of the impact of the market and competition, taking account of the need for high-quality public services and the damaging consequences of the liberalisations and privatisations that have already taken place in various areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
