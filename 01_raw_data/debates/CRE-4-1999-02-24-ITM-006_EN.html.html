<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Volmer, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Madam President, the European Union has been negotiating an agreement with South Africa since 1995. Among other things, the draft agreement provides for the creation of a free trade area within the space of ten years and for the wide‐ranging development of cooperation in the political, economic and development policy fields. The negotiations proved very difficult from the outset, especially because of the problems on both sides in regard to opening up their agricultural markets and because of the divergent positions on the use of designations of origin for port and sherry produced in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Sensitive agricultural products can only be exempted from the liberalisation to a certain extent, because otherwise the agreement might not be WTO‐compatible. Despite these problems, the European Union has repeatedly confirmed its great political and economic interest in the agreement with South Africa. The Vienna European Council called for the agreement to be concluded by the time of the Berlin special Council at the latest. A global compromise was negotiated between Commissioner Pinheiro and the South African trade minister Mr Erwin in Davos on 29 January, on the margins of the world economic forum.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency of the Council tried to achieve political agreement on the conclusion of that agreement in the Council on 22 February, on the basis of this compromise package, which was to have been formally confirmed in the Council on 22 March. But it emerged at that Council meeting that there was still no consensus within the European Union on the conclusion of an agreement based on the compromise package negotiated by the Commission. The main problem is the reservations expressed by several Member States about the proposed rules on the use of designations of origin for port and sherry. In practice it is a question of the use of the designation port and sherry on the South African market for products produced in South Africa. What is a particular headache for some Member States is that unsatisfactory rules might create a precedent for relations with other trade partners. Similarly, some Member States are not happy with the negotiated import quotas and tariff‐dismantling timetables for tinned fruit and fruit juices.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, the Council welcomed the progress made in the last round of negotiations and requested the Commission to submit proposals for resolving the pending questions as soon as possible, with the aim of reaching political consensus on the conclusion of the agreement at the next Council meeting on 22 March. At the same time the presidency confirmed that the EU was resolved to reach consensus before the special European Council meeting in Berlin on 24/25 March.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already gone to work and opened bilateral talks with those Member States that still have problems with this. We do not yet know the details of a possible solution. Perhaps further talks will be needed with South Africa. In the run‐up to the Council of 22 January the South African leader of the negotiations, the trade minister Mr Erwin, sent a letter to Commissioner Pinheiro in which he actually categorically rejected any amendment of the compromise reached in Davos. The German Presidency is fully aware how important this agreement is to political and economic relations with South Africa and of its importance as a clear sign of support for South African democracy and as a contribution to stabilising southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few weeks we will therefore resolutely support the Commission in its difficult task. We are firmly resolved to keep to the timetable laid down by the European Council in Vienna – conclusion of the agreement by the time of the special Council in Berlin. We are confident that all concerned will show the necessary flexibility to resolve the few remaining points of dispute. You may rest assured that the German Presidency will do all in its power to ensure that the Council assents to the conclusion of the agreement in good time.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theorin </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, ever since the abolition of apartheid in South Africa, the leaders of the European Union have constantly given President Mandela assurances that a fair agreement on trade would be concluded – a much‐needed, strategic agreement which would encourage development in the poorest regions of South Africa, and which is of the utmost importance for the peace, stability and development of the whole southern African region.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations, which have been in progress for nearly four years, have not always reflected those fine promises, but have been marked on numerous occasions by the worst sort of protectionist tendencies, regardless of whether the goods involved were fruit and vegetables, wine, potatoes or cut flowers.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and again, Parliament and its delegation for relations with South Africa have called for the finalisation of such an agreement. The Heads of State and Government, when they met in Cardiff and Vienna, promised to conclude the agreement as soon as possible, and no later than March 1999. The reasons are obvious: the negotiations have been going on for far too long, the South African Parliament is to be dissolved in March, and Nelson Mandela's term as President will come to an end. To put it mildly, it is embarrassing that now, in the final stages of the negotiations, some countries are prepared to assume the enormous political responsibility of jeopardising the agreement and thus the whole credibility of the European Union in the eyes of the third world. How is anyone to feel confident about negotiating with the EU if we cannot finalise this agreement with South Africa?</p>
<p class="contents">What has Europe done? Well, our predatory pricing tactics have forced down the price of tomatoes on the South African market, thereby putting thousands of women out of work – women who, in turn, provide for seven or eight other people – and now, at the last minute, we are quibbling over port and sherry. This is an issue that has already been resolved during the negotiations. I assume that the constructive approach which the Council has shown here will actually be carried through. Of course, it is not just the European countries that are protesting with whom we should be having discussions: South Africa should also be a party to the talks. South Africa also has to have something to show its citizens. Should we really be jeopardising Europe's good name in this way?</p>

Mr Pinheiro stuck his neck out. I think it is in fact a great shame that he was let down by four Member States. In my opinion, the issues involved – wine names, quotas of wine, fruit and a couple of juices – really did not merit such a fuss. But I am glad that the matter of cut flowers, which was causing quite a few problems in my own country, has at least been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The talks have taken four years. It was a very difficult dossier. We knew that. But the fisheries problem had already been sorted out, because a round of talks was held at the same time. So I find it all the more regrettable that the problems were not resolved beforehand in the specialist Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the social and economic situation in South Africa is downright bleak. It is a great deal worse than we had expected back in 1994. Surely – and I put this question to the Council presidency – part of the reason is that we continue to close our European market to them? So I wonder if we are not partly to blame. Remember Cardiff: remember the promises made to Mr Mandela there. And remember what was agreed in Vienna, that the dossier had to be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the German Presidency is this: what rabbits can you pull out of your hat in order to unblock the dossier? I do not doubt that you have done your best. But how are you going to unblock it? I am calling on the presidency here, and in fact I am issuing you with a challenge: let us see what you are made of, and try to find a solution, because the people of South Africa are entitled to our continuing support.</p>

Are we to be shamed yet again? We have often said how much we respect South Africa for the way it has tried to heal its wounds following the abolition of apartheid, and how much we admire and esteem President Mandela. Consequently, we are mortified to learn that our Council of Ministers has been too weak to give its approval to the trade agreement with South Africa, an agreement that has taken an unconscionably long time to negotiate – three and a half years, to be precise.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments put forward by the French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ministers for not approving the agreement are trivial and petty in the extreme. There is some cause for concern that their true objective is to leave the door open for a renegotiation of the whole agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I should like to ask the representative of the presidency if he can give his assurance that my concern is unfounded, that all the main elements of the agreement stand and that it will be approved in the near future, in other words by 22 March, without undergoing any substantial change. If the European Parliament receives such an assurance from the presidency, then today's debate will have been worthwhile. For my part, I can assure the Council that indignation is rife in the House over what we see as a betrayal of the strong desire that exists in Europe for an expansive and warm relationship with a country and a continent that are close to our hearts.</p>

This House has already underlined the importance of this agreement by asking for the negotiations to be speeded up. Having helped to eliminate the odious system of apartheid, we cannot ignore the fate of the people of South Africa. Every effort must be made to ensure that the black population which has suffered so much finally sees an improvement in its living conditions. The European Union must help with this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why my group is disagreeably surprised by the Council"s rejection of this agreement. Obviously the reasons cited must be taken into consideration, but they could be resolved at a later stage without jeopardising the whole agreement. I must stress this point. Surely the agreement could be implemented and the problems raised could be sorted out later. The Council"s rejection sends the wrong signal to the South African people. Therefore, on behalf of my group, I must ask you, Mr President‐in‐Office, to intervene in order to ensure that the Council urgently gives the go‐ahead to an agreement which can only serve to help South Africa develop.</p>

I can assure you that this new presidency of the Council already enjoys a good advance reputation and we hope that good reputation will be reflected in an equally good outcome to the negotiations with South Africa. We are surprised that at its last meeting the Council did not accept the compromise Mr Pinheiro negotiated with South Africa. Four years of negotiations means of course four years of toil on both sides. We expected a great deal of South Africa after the bitter times of apartheid, a policy that was supported by many EU countries and not just financially.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is, therefore, only appropriate that the European Union should support South Africa, and time is pressing. Mr Mandela has tried his best. He needs the support of this agreement for the forthcoming elections – for it is not just European elections that are about to be held, but South African elections too – and support not just from the Member States but from the presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want the debts of apartheid to have to be paid, because that the would mean that the population, the people of South Africa, would have to pay twice over. That is one point. But we also want to try to accommodate them, not just in regard to the wine and sherry market but also in an area that seems to be causing difficulties – for Germany, the Netherlands and Austria – namely the emigration clause. I believe it is up to us to show that we can reach a rapid outcome by March, and that is what we request and urge you to do as President‐in‐Office of the Council.</p>

Although we understand the United Kingdom's special attitude towards the South Africans, we would like to see the same understanding and tolerance of our own position on products which rival those of our Mediterranean economies, as 40 000 farmers reminded us the other day. I particularly have in mind products with such revered names as sherry, port and grappa, which are flooding our supermarkets.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not just opposed to the quantity of these products. Our opposition is chiefly aimed at labelling, which sparked off this dispute. Consumers need clearer and more informative labelling, particularly as regards origin. France is waging a campaign in defence of French names such as champagne and cognac. They are even tackling the Russians because of their Champansky. It is only logical that we should be anxious to protect our own designations of origin, because these reflect the cumulative cultural effect of generation upon generation of producers, and this is certainly appreciated by connoisseurs.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to products covered by agreements on fishing, textiles and imports of competing agricultural products, the question of designations of origin is also a legitimate source of disagreement. We cannot accept this situation.</p>

This latest example of the Commission exceeding its mandate highlights the need for strict supervision of its role in trade negotiations. The negotiating mandates must be sufficiently precise and their execution must be subject to constant monitoring by the Council. The Commission must not be allowed to sign draft agreements which appear to be binding on the Council and which put the countries with which we are negotiating in an uncertain position.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made clear that it is not the Commission which gives undertakings on behalf of the EU but the Council acting as the representative of the Member States. In the present case, although the Commission may be acting with the best of intentions in trying to reach an agreement with South Africa, it should not be allowed to exceed its mandate and irresponsibly offer to sacrifice the interests of whole sections of our agriculture, particularly at a time when, as we saw on Monday here in Brussels, European agriculture is experiencing very serious social problems.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Glenys (PSE).</span>  – Madam President, as a veteran observer of these four‐year long negotiations I suppose I should not have been surprised by the attitude, particularly of France and Spain, at Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council. How can they argue that the Davos package is too generous to President Mandela's South Africa? How can such a ridiculous proposal as that on port and sherry be allowed to scupper the greatest opportunity that we have to offer real and practical solidarity to South Africa?</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what we have heard over here, South Africa has made considerable concessions on port and sherry in the interests of making a wide agreement. The South African negotiators have brokered a very significant consensus in their own country in a very difficult situation. Alex Erwin, the Trade Minister, speaking this morning in Cape Town, said that the decision on Monday was extremely disappointing. He does this against a backdrop of increasing nervousness in the agriculture, industry, trade union and other sectors in his country. Mr Erwin asked Europe to see sense, to avoid re‐opening the package, and once again to talk about trade, development and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to open up the wider negotiations, to talk about multilateral negotiations regarding trips and the WTO. The time has come for all EU Member States to display realism, generosity and vision, and less of the petty short‐sighted protectionism we saw on Monday. Political vision is what we need to see now. Both the South African Parliament and the European Parliament are anxious now to sign off this agreement once and for all before both in South Africa and here we move on to elections. March 22 is the EU's last chance to complete this agreement and to show real solidarity with our partners in South Africa.</p>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Council has taken no account whatsoever of the political aspect of our relations. South Africa needs help in consolidating a democracy which at present still seems very fragile; it needs to develop and progress; it needs people to teach the inhabitants how to work and how to become part of a world which is unknown to many of them. South Africa should be helped and not humiliated, especially now that the second democratic elections are about to take place, in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must not miss this opportunity. Europe is expert in the art of work, it has strong traditions, it can provide training, and it has SMEs that are ready to teach others how to see a job through and how to develop employment. All these talents should be passed on, so as to help promote a great nation which, until a few years ago, did not know the meaning of freedom, democracy and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should consider all these aspects and not dwell on four fruit juices.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Monday, our delegation will be in South Africa. I should like to take President Mandela and the Speaker of the South African Parliament, Mrs Juvuala – who was our guest in Strasbourg three months ago – a message of hope and fraternity and a positive response to their request for assistance. I should like to tell them that we wish to negotiate as equals but with understanding for their problems, not merely to listen, and also that we can overcome the obstacles which – regrettably – have emerged on our side and have wrecked the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the joint resolution will be adopted tomorrow, so as to restore a relationship which is currently looking rather jaded, it seems to me.</p>

I say that by way of introduction to my comments on this issue. I think that the Council did the right thing in blocking this agreement until the points on port, sherry and other related issues have been rectified. These points are very important for our citizens and electors. Whereas we as Members of this House represent our electors, Commissioner Pinheiro only represents himself. Let me repeat that: he only has himself to represent. That is why he can afford to be so relaxed about solving the sherry and port issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, whilst I am all in favour of rapidly concluding an agreement that would meet the key requirements of our friends in South Africa and strengthen the anti‐racist democratic system in that country, I am also appealing for a sensible approach which recognises the interests of our own producers. My English friends who have spoken in this debate will know from their history lessons that port is produced in Portugal. Furthermore, they are linked to that history themselves. That is why they should be defending the authenticity of this product. I would be pleased if those historical links did not stop with the Methuen Treaty, but continued with present‐day port.</p>

Mr Volmer said in his charming fashion: we are firmly resolved, we are confident, we will do our utmost. In the same breath he added: but we do not yet know what the various components of the solution will look like. Thirdly, he said: South Africa has rejected any amendment of the agreement out of hand. Somewhere in the middle of all this is the discretion that we actually have at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all the previous speakers on this subject, I personally regard what we are doing with South Africa as a scandal. Anyone who looks at developments in South Africa can see that things are going downhill, that social conditions are getting worse and worse, that social conflict can be expected when Mbeki takes over from Mandela, because the people who were promised the moon can be given nothing. We had all hoped this southern African country could hold the promise of economic growth, from which we could draw some hope again for this supposedly lost continent. And what does the Council do, and incidentally not just after this rejection? The whole business has been dragging on since 1995, with one scandalous decision after another! The Council is deliberately allowing a country that needs our help to go downhill. That has psychological consequences too! It is a question of credibility, of honesty, which is why you, esteemed representative of the Council, must be as tough and rigorous as you can! Germany also hesitated for a long time before openly discussing the agricultural problems, but now, like other countries, it is doing so. I beg you not to underestimate the implications this also has for the European Union!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spiers </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I want to make two points. Firstly, we are talking here about a package. Both sides have made compromises. If you try to re‐draw the package at this stage you will lose the whole deal. Various Members have talked about wines and spirits and the labels for port and sherry. They should read what is in the agreement. South Africa agrees to phase out the labels in third countries within five years. In any case, it is a minuscule market. They will phase them out in SADC over eight years. They will keep them in SACU for twelve years pending settlement in the WTO. The EU should not try by thuggish pressure to subvert South Africa's position in what are multilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten that Commissioner Pinheiro has behaved well. That does not apply to all the Commission. DG VI has been at its protectionist worst and everyone knows that is very bad indeed. Behind all the arguments about wines and spirits, port and sherry lies raw agricultural protectionism. Spain raised problems with agriculture. France raised problems with export refunds. If the Heads of Government cannot assert themselves and overcome these sectional interests we risk losing the whole agreement.</p>

After all, the Council has made enormous efforts to finally get this agreement concluded, for we rate its importance as highly as many of the speakers here. Considering that we introduced economic sanctions in the past to bring down the apartheid system, it would be only logical to give economic aid now in order to support the process of democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must take a decision of principle between solidarity with developing countries that are going through a difficult phase of transformation and the national interests of individual Member States. I think that what many Member States are demanding for themselves, namely the improvement of their own development chances by structuring their economy in a certain way, applies all the more and all the more clearly for third world countries. That is why basically all I can do is take up your criticism and your ideas and put them before the Council in the hope that the countries that are blocking the conclusion of the agreement will also take due note of what you have said and perhaps review their position again.</p>
