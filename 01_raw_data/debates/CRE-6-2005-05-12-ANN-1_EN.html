<p>(FR)On 31 January 2005, the Council adopted an EU Action Plan to help the countries which had been devastated by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provided for enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the Member States with a view to enabling the Commission to monitor in an appropriate fashion the commitments given by the Member States. The Commission was instructed to report back to the Council on a regular basis.</p>
<p>At operational level, monitoring and coordination of commitments given in connection with humanitarian aid are the responsibility of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) using, firstly, a networked system (known as the 14-point system) which enables the financing decisions taken by the Member States to be entered directly and, secondly, regular reports relating to the financing decisions taken by the Community as a whole.</p>
<p>With regard to reconstruction, the Commission has established a system of focal points so that information on financial commitments and financing decisions taken by the Member States may be exchanged between the Commission and the Member States, centralised and regularly updated.</p>
<p>At the Council meeting held on 25 April 2005, the Commission presented two communications<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">, </span><a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, one with a view to reinforcing the European Union's capacity to react to disasters and crises, the other on ways of improving the Community Civil Protection Mechanism.</p>
<p>The Council also noted the report by the Secretary-General/High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, on the follow-up to the EU Action Plan dated 31 January 2005<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which covered in more detail the following two aspects:</p>
<p>- reinforcing the EU's rapid reaction capability by using military resources;</p>
<p>- reinforcing consular coordination.</p>
<p>Finally, at the Council meeting on 23 and 24 May 2005, to be attended by the Foreign Ministers and by the Development Cooperation Ministers, the Presidency intends to submit a document giving an initial progress report on the implementation of the EU Action Plan dated 31 January 2005 on the basis of the 17 points identified in the Action Plan, including a report on the documents submitted by the Commission and by the Secretary-General/High Representative to the GAERC on 25 April 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the report by the independent expert sent to Afghanistan by the UN, Cherif Bassiouni, a large number of serious human rights violations are still being committed there by 'coalition' forces, private security firms and the Afghan police. Among other things, the UN expert refers to sexual abuse, beatings, torture and use of force resulting in death. He also cites witness statements reporting that hoods are placed over prisoners' heads so that they do not know where they are, that they are deprived of sleep and food, and that they are forced to remain in painful positions for long periods of time. The report also protests against the fact that the 'coalition forces' continue to deny UN envoys access to their installations.</p>

<p>(FR) The Council is certainly fully aware of the report of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, M. Cherif Bassiouni. The EU has very serious concerns at the content of this report, and continues to monitor closely the human rights situation in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The EU has been vigorous in support for the independent expert. The EU was the prime mover behind the Chair's statement on Afghanistan at UN CHR 61 in Geneva under agenda item 19, following close consultations with the government of Afghanistan and other interested parties. This statement covers in detail recent developments and commitments undertaken in the field of human rights, inter alia on the basis of the report of the independent expert (E/CN.4/2005/122). </p>
<p>Through the Chairperson's statement, the UN Commission on Human Rights requests the Afghan Government to continue cooperating fully with all special rapporteurs and human rights mechanisms of the UN and to implement their recommendations. It also requests the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor the human rights situation in Afghanistan, to compile a report on it and to expand its programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights and the rule of law. The final text of the statement can shortly be found on the website of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (www.ohchr.org).</p>
<p>The EU fully agrees with the need for continuing monitoring and reporting on human rights violations in Afghanistan, however they may arise. It is important that the local Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights receive proper funding.</p>
<p>The Council also receives its own regular reporting from the EU Special Representative, Francesc Vendrell, on developments in Afghanistan, including those in the field of human rights. This informs decisions taken within the Council on EU policy towards that country.</p>
<p>More generally, the Council is committed to safeguarding human rights in all countries of the world. All individuals should be entitled to the same protection, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

<p>According to an article published in the newspaper 'Imerisia' on 4 March 2005, the US army is funding the development of a weapon with a range of two kilometres which causes excruciating pain for a certain period of time. This weapon, which is classed as a biological weapon, is designed to deal with demonstrators with the aim of causing extreme pain without causing injury, but it is feared that it will also be used for torture. This revelation, which was made public by a body active in the field of biological weapons research, has sparked protests and deep concern among scientists, both on account of the ethical aspects linked to the construction of such a weapon and on account of its long-term side-effects on the human body.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of the construction of this weapon? Does it approve of the use of biological weapons as a means of repression? What is its position on the fact that this pain-inducing weapon is being funded by the US army?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Council has not received any information about the weapon described in the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>All EU Member States, plus the United States, are parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). The EU sees this Convention as the cornerstone of its efforts to prevent the development and use of biological agents and toxins as arms. The BTWC celebrated its 30th birthday on 26 March 2005.</p>
<p>The BTWC was the first Convention to ban an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, and it is a key component in the international non-proliferation and disarmament regime. A Review Conference on the Convention is set to take place in 2006.</p>
<p>All EU Member States attach the highest importance to strengthening the Convention and to complying with its provisions, and have undertaken to channel their efforts into arranging the Review Conference due to take place in 2006.

There are numerous occasions on which not only Members of the Barroso Commission, but also members of former Commissions expressed themselves on the Constitution and explained its importance for the future of Europe.</p>

<p>(EN)The average NUTS 2 population for the EU-25 (in 2002) is 1.790.000 inhabitants ; in Greece the average population at NUTS 2 level (in 2002) is 842.000 inhabitants. I do not believe that the size of a region covered by a programme is in itself a factor which affects the development of that given region. In that respect I do not think that we can define an «optimum» size for a region either.</p>
<p>It has to been recalled that at the current programming period, Member States (with the exception of Member States with a federal structure) have opted for regional operational programmes at NUTS II level and for sectoral and / or horizontal programmes with a national coverage. In the 2007 – 2013 period, according to the draft Regulations, Member States shall establish the Operational programmes at the appropriate geographical level and at least at regional level NUTS II (under the Covergence objective) and at least at regional NUTS I or NUTS II level under the “Regional competitiveness and employment” objective, in accordance with the institutional system specific to the Member State. While respecting those provisions, Member States are therefore free to form inter-regional entities under a programme. By doing so, they will nevertheless have to pay particular attention to ensuring the best possible definition of strategy, existence of appropriate structures and coordination mechanisms in order to define the scope and priorities of the programme as well as its implementation, monitoring, control and evaluation.</p>
<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita determines eligibility of a region for Objective 1 support in the 2000 - 2006 programming period (and will do so also for the future convergence objective in the 2007-2013 programming period). Regions with a GDP per capita (in Purchasing Power Parities, which adjusts for differences in the cost of living between countries) below 75% of the community average are eligible. This eligibility decision is based upon the data for the three most recent years at the moment the decision is taken.</p>
<p>Member States willing to request a revision of the NUTS nomenclature should closely cooperate with Eurostat. Eurostat will examine on a case-by-case basis whether an internal reform of the administrative structure of a Member States corresponds to a “substantial reorganisation” as defined under Article 5, §4 of the Regulation on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (Regulation(EC) n°1059/2003 of the Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0308"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the disaster that struck the prefecture of Evros in February of this year and, first of all, the Commission wishes to express its the deep sympathy for the people that have suffered or are still suffering from the consequences of this event.</p>
<p>The Council Regulation establishing the EU Solidarity Fund does not allow the Commission to activate the Solidarity Fund upon its own initiative. The Commission can only act if the national authorities of the affected country formally apply for assistance within 10 weeks of the beginning of the disaster. Contacts have been established between DG Regional Policy and the Greek authorities several weeks ago and my services have given the Greek authorities detailed advice on the possibility and procedures for an application to mobilise the Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p>On 22 April the Greek authorities have made a formal application for assistance from the Fund. The relevant letter, however, contains no detailed information on the disaster. The Commission cannot assess this application until this information has been received. Therefore it is not able to comment today on its final position on this application.</p>
<p>The Commission, on this occasion, underlines that the Solidarity Fund was created to assist Member States and candidate countries in the event of major disasters with direct damage exceeding a rather high threshold – which for Greece is currently at € 918 million. If this threshold is not reached the possibilities to mobilise the Fund are extremely limited and subject to a number of very strict conditions imposed by the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may be interested to know that - with now over 30 Solidarity fund applications received since the creation of the Fund in 2002 - the Commission has come to the view that the current thresholds to mobilise the Fund are excessively high. In order to address this issue, a lower threshold has been established by the Commission in its recent proposal for a new Solidarity Fund regulation adopted on 6 April.</p>
<p>The Commission may still add that, for the Honourable Member’s information, in the framework of the Regional Operational Programme «Oriental Macedonia &amp; Thrace » 3 projects totalling around 4 Million € are co-financed by the Structural Funds to reduce the risk of flooding in the Evros Region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0310"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member of Parliament to the answer given by President Barroso on behalf of the Commission to his previous written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2005-0620_EN.html">P-0620/05</a></p>
<p>The Lisbon strategy set out a broad range of objectives and policy tools the basic aim of which is to turn the European Union into the world’s most competitive economy by 2010. At mid-term in this process, the results are manifestly disappointing although that is not to say that the results are entirely negative. Although the poor economic performance has partly been the result of the cyclical slowdowns at both world and European level, much more can be done to stimulate economic growth. Structural reforms are especially important in view of the challenges of globalisation, ageing populations and enlargement that are now facing the EU.</p>
<p>The contribution of cohesion policy to the Lisbon Strategy is unquestionable. Cohesion policy not only has an important redistribution function in favour of the less developed Member States and regions, which has a significant macroeconomic impact; it also contributes to the competitiveness of regions where there is underutilised potential and therefore has a direct influence on EU-wide economic performance in line with the Lisbon targets.</p>
<p>In the framework of cohesion policy almost EUR 80 billion have been disbursed since 2000 to support the Lisbon’s strategy main aims, with the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund set to invest for the period 2000-2006:</p>
<p>EUR 39,5 billion on transport infrastructure (out of which the trans-European networks for transport account for EUR 9,8 billion) and 19,4 billion on environmental infrastructure;</p>
<p>EUR 21,6 billion on the development of SME’s and 3 billion for risk capital for SMEs;</p>
<p>EUR 9,6 billion on research, technological development and innovation;</p>
<p>EUR 6,2 billion on infrastructure in the telecommunications and information society areas;</p>
<p>EUR 1,5 billion on educational and vocational training infrastructure</p>
<p>Issues such as the downsizing of urban areas in certain Member States or the concentrations of population in certain urban areas in other Member States (such as inner London) illustrate the breadth of disparities across the EU’s territory. To combat problems of social exclusion, rising crime rates, or a further worsening of quality of life in deprived urban areas, the Structural Funds support the development of participative and integrated strategies to tackle the high concentration of economic environmental and social problems affecting urban agglomerations.</p>
<p>For the next generation of cohesion programmes, the Commission proposes a more strategic approach in an effort to ensure that their content is targeted on growth and jobs, thus the Commission proposals for the operation of the Structural Funds in 2007-2013 entail strengthening the relationship between Structural Fund interventions and the Lisbon Strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0328"></a>

<p>(EN)The Treaties provide for the support of cultural projects through Structural Funds, albeit within the designated limits.</p>
<p>These funds do of course need to be reoriented towards supporting and profiting from the Lisbon Strategy. However, it goes without saying that cohesion policy must find a balanced policy mix which is adapted to the current circumstances. Cultural projects must find their place in this next funding period.</p>
<p>Together with tourism such projects contribute both directly and indirectly to regional development. Investment in both cultural heritage and tourism activities is usually labour intensive, with comparatively high levels of local and regional demand.</p>
<p>The main focus of cohesion policy is on regions lagging behind in their development; the so called convergence regions. Within this group, we find regions that suffer from multiple disadvantages, having characteristics of being low income, landlocked or island, peripheral or ultra-peripheral regions. Cohesion policy must also offer suitable development strategies for these regions and while progressing towards the core targets of the Lisbon process, it must take into account the fact that tourism will remain a major source of income for most of them. The main elements of tourism strategies are the region’s natural and cultural assets. The “mise en valeur” of cultural assets is therefore of utmost importance, especially in those regions lacking significant natural assets.</p>
<p>Culture makes a significant contribution to the overall economy and the interface between art (including contemporary art) and related businesses offers much scope for Structural Fund activity, particularly through innovations and SMEs. It is normally a part of the economy which is rather labour intensive and is often suitable for private-public partnerships. Support for harnessing such potential, including relevant network and territorial cooperation elements, is to be sought through cohesion instruments which focus on the business sector and instruments for cross-border activities.</p>
<p>Consequently, ERDF regulation proposes that convergence regions include cultural assets as a means to develop sustainable tourism and to protect and enhance cultural heritage and therefore support economic development. The suggested cross-border strand of the “European territorial cooperation” objective addresses culture in two ways, firstly by encouraging entrepreneurship and SME development and secondly, by developing the capacity and joint use of infrastructures in the cultural sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0331"></a>

<p>Is the Commission aware that there are regions in North-Rhine Westphalia which are facing structural problems more critical than those in other European major regions which, even after the changes made to the European aid structures from 2007 onwards, will continue to receive EU funding? For example, unemployment rates in Gelsenkirchen (16.7%) and Duisburg (26.1%) are higher than those in the five new German Länder and also higher than in some regions of the Central and Eastern European accession countries. In addition, the planned sugar market reform will require significant structural adjustment measures to be taken in the Lower Rhine region, in the Aachen Bight and in the Cologne Basin.</p>

<p>(EN)In July 2004 the Commission presented its draft regulations for the next funding period 2007 - 2013. In its proposal the Commission has kept its clear focus on the least developed regions, the so called “convergence regions”, having a per capita GNI below 75 % of the average EU GNI.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is of the opinion that there are regions and parts of regions outside the convergence objective that would also need support from the Structural Funds. This is why it proposed a share of more than 17 % of the Structural Funds for an objective called “Regional competitiveness and employment”.</p>
<p>In contrast to the current funding period the Commission will not determine the geographical concentration for interventions within the objective “Regional competitiveness and employment”. In the future the regions themselves will be able to choose where to concentrate their spending in geographical terms. However, the Commission considers that a thematic concentration of spending (e.g. for innovation and research) is necessary. This should ensure a high leverage of Structural Funds investment and eventually boost Europe’s potential for growth.</p>
<p>As to the Honourable member’s specific concern, namely high unemployment in Gelsenkirchen and Duisburg, the Commission can assures that it is well aware of the situation in Northrhine-Westphalia and its structural problems. Partnership is an essential principle of cohesion policy, which ensures close relations with the regions in order to remain receptive to their problems and needs. In February this year the Commission visited Northrhine-Westphalia and on that occasion it went to Gelsenkirchen. The Lord Mayor Baranowski provided the Commission with examples of the efficient use of the ERDF as well as examples of where further support will be necessary.</p>
<p>In the next programming period, Northrhine-Westphalia will be eligible under two objectives; “Regional competitiveness and employment” and “European Territorial Cooperation”. Therefore, Northrhine-Westphalia will be able to benefit from EU support for growth enhancing investment such as innovation, accessibility, environment and human resources.</p>
<p>The Commission is positive that the EU Structural Fund support will help Northrine-Westfalia to overcome the difficulties it is currently facing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0276"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission follows closely the issues of freedom of religion and minority rights in Turkey. In its Regular Reports the Commission has identified four main areas of concern for religious minorities, namely their lack of legal personality, their restricted property rights, the interference by the state in the management of their foundations, and the ban of the training of clergy. As stated in the 2004 Report, the religious communities’ lack of legal status means that their properties are permanently at risk of being confiscated. Furthermore, attempts to recover property by judicial means still encounter numerous obstacles.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the specific case of the possible sale of Church properties in the village of Bote in Mardin. It is understood that the villagers do not possess title deeds for the Church, as is customary for Syriacs in the region, and that the property is not registered in the local land registry, which exposes it to the risk of confiscation. The Commission has regularly raised the issue of confiscations of the property of religious communities with the Turkish authorities, who claim to be applying the existing legislation correctly.</p>
<p>The Commission has recommended an overhaul of the existing laws governing religious foundations. The Commission has undertaken several measures to assist the Turkish authorities in ensuring that future legislation conforms fully to EU standards. For example, the Commission has commented on a new draft law on foundations which was drawn up at the end of 2004, and will continue to advise the Turkish authorities as this draft law enters its final phase of preparation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0278"></a>

<p>(EN)The European Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member of Parliament that it has not been directly informed of the Swedish initiative that he refers to.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to seize this opportunity to draw the attention of the Honourable Member of Parliament to legislation and policies that it developed in response to the abolition of border controls between Member States that caused an increase in the movement of persons, goods and capital within the European Union. Consequently, police and judicial authorities needed suitable measures to combat international crime which was taking advantage of these new freedoms.</p>
<p>In that respect, the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> intends to supplement and facilitate the application between the Member States of existing instruments such as the 1959 Council of Europe Convention and its 1978 Protocol and the 1990 Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p>To facilitate closer co-operation between law enforcement authorities, judicial authorities and other competent authorities, new techniques have been developed in the field to help mutual assistance. Examples are video-conferencing (Article 10), teleconferencing (Article 11) and interception of telecommunication (Articles 17-22), and in particular Article 18 (request for interception of tele-communica-tions), Article 19 (interception of telecommunications on national territory by the use of service providers) and Article 20 (interception of telecommunications without the technical assistance of another Member State).</p>
<p>The Convention contains (strict) rules on data protection (Article 23) and on criminal and civil liability regarding officials (Articles 15 and 16).</p>
<p>The 2000 Convention has not yet entered into force. Article 27 stipulates that this will happen when 8 signatories that were EU Member States when the Convention was adopted, will ratify it. The Convention will be in force between the Member States who ratified it, when the conditions of Article 27 are met.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hague Programme on Strengthening Freedom, Security and Justice in the European Union, also highlights the importance of information exchange for law enforcement. The Programme introduces the principle of availability as a novel concept to improve information exchange and recognises the importance of the Swedish initiative on the simplification of information exchange that is currently under discussion in Council. This initiative aims at improving the police cooperation practice that has emerged over the last decade in the context of the implementation of the Schengen Convention. The Schengen evaluation process has highlighted scope for the development of the information exchange.</p>
<p>Both the 2000 Convention and the Hague Programme scrupulously respect the balance between protecting fundamental rights and affording law enforcement competencies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The terms used are misleading as ‘nötfars’ is a minced-meat preparation (and contains more than minced meat does) and ‘lövbiff’ is a meat preparation (and not fresh meat). Specific rules, adapted to the risks, apply to each category of product.</p>
<p>In terms of possible hazards for the consumer, minced meat and minced-meat preparations, on the one hand, and meat preparations, on the other hand, present potential risks if eaten raw or undercooked. As a result of poor hygiene practices, Salmonella infection can be spread via contaminated raw products to other foodstuffs and so pose a risk to public health.</p>
<p>Council Directive 94/65/EC, laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations, was adopted inter alia to combat such risks.</p>
<p>The provenance of the foodstuffs may have a bearing on the frequency of their microbiological testing:</p>
<p>If the products referred to by the Honourable Member are produced in an EU-approved establishment, then the relevant microbiological sampling is undertaken by the establishment. Imports from third countries must also have been tested microbiologically in the country of origin. In so far as the specific additional guarantees for salmonella for Sweden and Finland, which cover the trade of certain live animals, eggs, fresh meat and minced meat, are concerned, minced meat sent from other Member States to Sweden or Finland must comply with Article 3 (1) (g) (i) third indent of Council Directive 94/65/EC, that is, bear an indication that a microbiological test by sampling in the establishment of origin has been carried out or the meat is intended for processing.</p>
<p>If, however, the foodstuffs are produced to take account of particular habits of consumption in Sweden then the provisions of Article 6 of the Directive apply. This means that under certain conditions Sweden may authorise the production and placing only on the Swedish market of meat preparations not meeting all the requirements for placing products on the Community market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Mother and child health is indeed an important topic, and the Commission welcomes the initiative of the World Health Organisation in highlighting this issue.</p>
<p>Within the European Union, the Commission has seen steady improvements in the health of mothers and children in recent decades, with falling infant mortality as well as maternal mortality and morbidity. The primary credit for these reductions belongs to the Member States – after all, as with all health services, healthcare for mothers and children is primarily the responsibility of national and local authorities. This includes provision of medical care, medicinal products and associated services such as social care.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, work at European level can help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services and policies to protect the health and lives of mothers and children. By establishing relevant indicators for children’s and women’s health, and gathering data that enable us to compare outcomes in different countries, the Commission can identify the scope for improvement. And by sharing best practices, European cooperation can help to bring standards across the Union up to those of the best. Health promotion and prevention on issues such as smoking, nutrition and reduction of cardiovascular disease and obesity are examples of where European level co-operation has led to heightened awareness and exchange of best practice. This is all the more important, for example, in the school setting. The resources of the Community public health programme have been used to support several initiatives of this type across Europe.</p>
<p>The Community acquis, however, is not significantly involved in ensuring maternal and child health. One specific issue which is addressed is that of the health and safety of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (Council Directive 92/85/EEC), which requires Member States' legislation to foresee an adequate payment and/or an adequate allowance for women on maternity leave. The allowance is adequate if it guarantees income at least equivalent to sick pay under national law.</p>
<p>Of course, Community rules exist to ensure the quality and safety of medicinal products and devices, and there are Community rules on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, including qualifications of health professionals. However, the entitlements of mothers and their children to health services and health products are a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is supporting collaboration on maternal and child health through tools such as the public health programme and the High Level Group on health services and medical care. For example, vaccination of children is of pivotal importance in preventing diseases like poliomyelitis, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis and other infections. The Commission is supporting several activities to identify, distribute, and promote good practice in childhood immunisation programmes including equal access and perception of immunisation and associated risks in different population groups. All the new Member States are fully collaborating in these activities. Furthermore, the Commission is monitoring through its network for the surveillance of communicable diseases the major vaccine preventable diseases in children.</p>
<p>Moreover, where there are gaps in national service provision that are holding back economic growth and sustainable development, the Community structural and cohesion funds can help by providing investment in health, and the Commission plans to reinforce these possibilities for the next programming period.</p>
<p>With this Community support to the activities of the Member States, and in collaboration with other partners such as the World Health Organisation, the Commission hopes that Europe will build on past improvements in the health of mothers and children in the years to come.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0286"></a>

<p>For the last two months the French side of the Somport pass has been closed to lorries of over 3.5 tonnes. The French authorities have said that the route will not be reopened to heavy goods vehicles until at least the summer. Meanwhile, alternative routes from Aragon have been restricted by snow. In recent years, enormous efforts have been made on the Spanish side to increase the capacity of the route Zaragoza-Huesca-Jaca-Somport-Pau (a trans-European transport network project), but these have not been reciprocated on the French side. The other routes between Aragon and the Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees regions (rail link via the Vignemale tunnel; reopening of the Canfranc-Oloron crossborder rail line; improvement of the Bielsa tunnel) are still at the drawing-board stage.</p>
<p>In view of these circumstances, which, as has happened repeatedly in recent years, have led to the interruption of goods traffic between Aragon and France, will the Commission open urgent infringement proceedings against France for maintaining restrictions on the transport of goods and people?</p>
<p>Does the Commission not believe that the relevant authorities in both Member States should be obliged to accelerate - with Community funding - the implementation of some of the above-mentioned projects, in order to eliminate the present bottleneck in the central Pyrenees?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)With regard to the first part of the honourable Member’s question, the Commission would like to refer her to the answers it gave during the March part-session Question Time.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission wishes to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the following.</p>
<p>As regards the repair works on the access route to the Somport tunnel on the French side, which is closed to vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes around Urdos in the Aspe valley following a landslide, the Commission asked the French authorities to provide detailed explanations. In light of these explanations, which were received at the end of March 2005, the Commission is forced to conclude that the closure of the RN 134 to heavy loads during the repair works (expected to continue until July 2005) is justified. Indeed, there is a real danger that the damage would be exacerbated if heavy loads were once again allowed to be transported on this damaged road. The temporary ban imposed by the regional authorities is therefore justified.</p>
<p>With regard to Community action to improve cross-Pyrenees transport infrastructures, the Commission wishes to underline that particular importance is attached to rail links, namely the two priority projects included in the April 2004 decision by Parliament and the Council, amending the Community guidelines on developing the trans-European transport network (TEN-T): the new high-capacity cross-Pyrenees corridor (Priority Project No 16) and the South-East European high-speed rail link (Priority Project No 3). As was already highlighted during the debate in March, preliminary studies are currently being carried out into the new high-capacity link with the aim of identifying the route options for this cross-border corridor, and this link represents a more long-term priority. If France and Spain were to put in a request to the Commission, it would be able to make a financial contribution to these studies. For 2007 – 2013, the Commission has also proposed a significant increase in the TEN-T budget (to EUR 20 billion for the seven-year period), which would pave the way for significant contributions, provided Parliament and the Council adopt this proposal. This also applies to Priority Project No 3, which is at an advanced stage in certain sections, and therefore already enjoys substantial support within the framework of the current Financial Perspective.</p>
<p>With regard to the other cross-Pyrenees axes highlighted by the honourable Member, the Commission wishes to emphasise the following. As regards the Canfranc-Oloron rail line, the Member States concerned, namely France and Spain, are responsible for analysing the economic and technical situation and for taking decisions on the basis of such analysis; the Bielsa tunnel is not part of the TEN-T and is therefore ineligible for Community support under the heading of the TEN-T budget. The Somport tunnel (increased safety) and the Bedous diversion along Route Nationale 134 (access to the Somport tunnel) have enjoyed Community support under the heading of the TEN-T budget in previous years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0289"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission attaches the greatest importance to communicating Europe to European citizens.</p>
<p>A recent special Eurobarometer survey entitled “Attitudes towards Development Aid” showed that Europeans expect the Commission to act as driving force for development. However, public awareness of EU activities in this field as well as of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is limited.</p>
<p>The EU is the world’s largest donor of development aid and should be recognised as such. The Commission has undertaken to increase public awareness of all EU policies in the new communication strategy it is now preparing in view of the June European Council. One of the main principles of this new approach is to better advocate the Commission’s policies and their impact on citizens’ daily lives and communicating the tangible benefits of these actions.</p>
<p>On 29 March 2005, the Commission approved the 2005 work programme for communicating the EU development policy. The budget to implement this programme is € 4.8 million.</p>
<p>This work programme has been developed on the basis of an information and communication strategy on the role of the European Union in the world and includes activities such as:</p>
<p>Publications, including teaching material and material for the new Member States.</p>
<p>The Lorenzo Natali Prize for journalists writing about Human Rights.</p>
<p>Participation in summits and cultural events.</p>
<p>A Youth initiative.</p>
<p>Training of journalists and Press Officers of Delegations in ACP countries.</p>
<p>Audiovisual Productions.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid attaches the greatest importance to communicating European cooperation to European citizens. European taxpayers have the right to know how their money is being spent, how the EU helps the developing countries, how the EU is fighting against poverty and infectious diseases and what the EU is doing to promote good governance, democracy and fundamental rights This is the reason why he planned a trip to all the Member States to explain why Europe should act as a driving force for development, and why he dedicates himself to conferences explaining the great importance of development. The year 2005 is a crucial year for developing policy. The Commission has presented its ideas for a new development policy and is focused on the G8 summit in July and the MDG’s summit in September.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0291"></a>

<p>(EN)The Treaty establishing the European Community provides powers to combat discrimination based on the grounds of sex, racial and ethnic origin, religion and belief, disability, age and sexual orientation (Article 13). The Council of Ministers adopted in particular Directive 2000/78/EC (Employment Equality Directive) which prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of religion and belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. This Directive contains an important provision for people with disabilities in Article 5 in that it requires that employers must not only refrain from discriminating but also must take steps to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities in the workplace to ensure that they are treated equally. However, there is no current EU anti-discrimination legislation that prohibits discrimination in access to goods and services.</p>
<p>Accessibility of mainstream goods by as broad a range of users as possible is a central issue with regard to the empowerment of people with disabilities and can only but contribute to a safe use of products. In its 2003 Communication on equal opportunities for people with disabilities, the Commission committed itself to encourage use of Design For All (products that fit all users, including users with disabilities).</p>
<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the consumer health and safety in general and to the protection of the most vulnerable consumers such as the elderly and children in particular. As for the Honourable Member’s interesting suggestion to specifically address the partially sighted, the Commission will consider carefully all available means to improve their consumer rights.</p>
<p>Community legislation, notably the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) and Directives harmonising health and safety aspects for a certain number of industrial products such as toys, personal protective equipments, medical devices, machinery, lifts, etc. (so called New Approach Directives) aims at ensuring that consumer products placed on the EU market are safe.</p>
<p>The risk assessment of products foresees that the most vulnerable consumers are taken into account.</p>
<p>As far as standards are concerned, which are used in practice to define the safety of products, CEN (the European Committee for Standardisation) and CENELEC (European Committee for Electro-technical Standardisation) have been contracted by the Commission and the European Free Trade Area, in the framework of the General Product Safety Directive, to elaborate “Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older people and persons with disabilities” to make sure that their needs and specific requirements are addressed when a standard is prepared.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that this approach must be maintained and reinforced.</p>
<p>Through its standardisation mandates, the Commission will encourage standards bodies to take the needs of disabled people even more into consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0292"></a>

<p>(FR)The possibility of gaining rapid access to information on criminal convictions handed down within the territory of the Union and taking them into account is one of the priorities in creating a European judicial area, the urgency of which was highlighted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004. Taking account of criminal convictions handed down in another Member State depends first of all upon the effective circulation of such information between Member States, which is not the case at present. In a White Paper adopted in January 2005, the Commission announced a series of legislative measures designed to remedy existing malfunctions in the exchange of information on criminal convictions. Moreover, back in October 2004 the Commission submitted a first proposal for a decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which did not involve substantive changes but was designed to bring about a rapid improvement in existing exchange mechanisms, mainly by shortening the deadlines for the transmission of information. This work will continue in 2005 with the submission of a proposal for a framework decision designed to enhance the exchange of information on convictions and laying down minimum rules for transmitting and keeping of such information.</p>
<p>On the more specific issue of taking such convictions into account, on 17 March 2005<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and this constitutes the first measure implementing the proposals set out in the White Paper.</p>
<p>Given that the fight against racketeering may also require specific measures, the Commission is also currently examining the possibility of preparing a legislative proposal to harmonise the definition of the offences of racketeering and extortion, as well as the related sanctions. Meetings will be held with experts from the Member States to ascertain the position under the relevant national legislation and conduct an exchange of views on the possible substance of any Commission proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)It is important to clarify what the President of the Commission actually said at the temporary committee on financial perspectives. President Barroso said that in theory the concept of co-financing in the Common Agricultural Policy could be a useful way to contribute to the resolution of the problem of excessive negative budget positions. However, in practice co-financing is not suitable for the first pillar. Firstly, it would breach the common financial solidarity for the agricultural sector in Europe, which produces, processes and trades its goods on the single market. Secondly, it would undermine the agreed basis for farmers to plan their future as it was decided by the Heads of States in Brussels in 2002 on financing the expenditure of direct aids and market measures in agriculture. This breach of trust would impact negatively on the prospects for further reform in sectors such as sugar, wine and fruit and vegetables. Thirdly, co-financing would also raise doubts as to the implementation of the reform of the CAP already decided in 2003, as well as with regard to the integration of the new Member States into the Common Agricultural Policy. For both decisions were made under the assumption of 100% Community financing.</p>
<p>Therefore, while national co-financing is a fundamental element in funding agriculture under the second pillar rural development, total EU-funding remains the Commission’s firm position on the funding of the first pillar direct aid and market measures. This has been clearly expressed in its proposal for the Financial Perspectives 2007 – 2013. It should also be stressed that such a solution would not facilitate the conclusions of the forthcoming negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0296"></a>

<p>(EN)In 2002 the Commission adopted a strategy to promote Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) as a business contribution to sustainable development. The strategy aimed at improving knowledge and facilitating the exchange of experience and good practice, and promoting the convergence and transparency of CSR practices and tools. It comprised three main elements: the integration of CSR into EU policies, co-operation with Member States on CSR public policy developments, and the EU CSR Forum.</p>
<p>The European Multi-stakeholder Forum on CSR brought together representatives of business, trade unions and civil society. It succeeded in building a measure of consensus among stakeholders but some differences and debates remained. The Commission welcomes the Forum’s work and final report of June 2004. The Commission considers that the Forum recommendations, if fully implemented by the relevant actors, would help advance CSR in Europe and globally.</p>
<p>While enterprises and their stakeholders are the primary actors in CSR, public authorities and the EU have a role to play in promoting CSR. Public authorities should further improve the consistency of their policies in support of sustainable growth and development thus enabling CSR. Initiatives such as Sustainable Impact Assessments, the new Generalised System of Preferences ‘GSP +’, the 6<span class="sup">th</span> RTD Framework Programme (FP6) under Priority 7, ‘Citizens and Governance in a knowledge-based society’ and the EU Action Plan on Agricultural Commodities, Dependence and Poverty are steps in that direction.</p>

<p>To a great extent, this problem is a reflection of a gap in the law on this particular subject.

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of trade practices of foodstuffs which are past their “use by dates”. These practices can represent a serious risk for public health and clearly must be stopped.</p>
<p>Provisions applicable to such foodstuffs are established by both the E.U. legislation on food hygiene and by the Regulation (EC) 178/2002 on General Food Law. This Regulation, directly applicable in national law, lays down general requirements in matters of food safety and, in particular, that a “food shall not be placed on the market if it is unsafe”, with the meaning of either being “injurious to health” or “unfit for human consumption”.</p>
<p>“Use by dates” are usually established by food producers, under their own responsibility, for foodstuffs which are highly perishable from a microbiological point of view. They imply that these foodstuffs shall not be eaten nor marketed after that “use by date” due to the fact that such products are considered as having become unsafe.</p>
<p>Any food business operator which would put or maintain such products on the market would clearly be infringing food safety requirements.</p>
<p>In accordance with Community rules on official food and feed controls, it is for the Competent Authorities in the Member States to verify that the food safety requirements are properly enforced by all types of food business operators along the food chain and where necessary to provide for corrective actions and/or to impose the appropriate sanctions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0307"></a>

<p>(FR)For the purposes of administrative and financial simplification, the Commission has proposed to scrap the Community initiatives from 2007 so as to mainstream them into more traditional programming. The LEADER approach with its three actions (local development pilot projects, cooperation, networking) is to be fully reintegrated into future programming. There will therefore be continuity in terms of implementing the LEADER approach for a fourth financial programming period.</p>
<p>The priority areas for the local action group strategies should correspond to one or more axes of rural development policy (competitiveness in the agri-food and forestry sectors, space management, the diversification of the rural economy and enhancing the quality of life in rural areas), as decided in the national rural development strategy, of which each Member State will notify the Commission.</p>
<p>The proposed 7% minimum rate is based on the results of the Commission study entitled ‘Methods for and success of mainstreaming LEADER innovations and approach into rural development programmes’ drawn up in 2004, which said that around 8% of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) is already in place, and following one or more features of the LEADER approach (integrated, territorial or partnership approach to rural development). The Member States that have already reached the 7% rate in their territory can propose a higher rate, commensurate with their needs, whereas Member States that have yet to reach the rate must endeavour to implement the LEADER approach, which has proved to be innovative and more effective than traditional programmes for local actors and private funding.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission has no plans to review the transitional and safeguard measures agreed to in the negotiating process of the 5<span class="sup">th</span> enlargement round. In line with the negotiating framework, such transitional measures in particular should not disrupt the proper functioning of the rules or policies of the Union and not lead to significant distortions of competition. The Commission does not see any evidence that these transitional measures granted would considerably affect the completion of the internal market or have a negative impact on fundamental European freedoms.</p>
<p>With regard to the performance of the new Member States in the last 12 months, the Commission is of the view that these Member States have sufficiently met the expectations set in the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>As to the justification of transitional measures, the Commission only proposed to grant such measures to candidate countries in well-founded cases and only after careful examination; decisions were made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the interests of all parties concerned. The Commission therefore thinks that these measures can be considered as justified, necessary and proportionate.</p>
<p>As to conclusions to be drawn for future enlargements, the basic components of the approach followed in the 5th enlargement round – accompanying the negotiations by the reinforced pre-accession strategy and carefully monitoring the candidate countries progress towards accession – remain valid. On the issue of how to proceed with further enlargements, the Commission has described its position in more detail in the 2004 Strategy Paper on progress in the enlargement process, which has been presented to the European Parliament in October 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0315"></a>

<p>(EN)According to the Act of Accession, similarly to previous enlargements, the new Member States must eliminate at their own expense the surplus quantities of agricultural products, and of sugar in particular, in free circulation within their territory at the date of accession to the EU. . That obligation does not amount to a penalty imposed on the new Member States, but rather to a compensation for the additional burden on the Community budget which may arise from the existence of surplus quantities on the agricultural markets.</p>
<p>New Member States had sufficient time prior to that date to take necessary preventive measures and to establish identification systems in order to trace down speculative activities, as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 60/2004<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>For the determination of surplus quantities it is necessary to obtain a picture of the normal carry over stock at a particular time.

<p>The Commission has also considered specific arguments put forward by New Member States.</p>
<p>A period of 6 months is afforded for eliminating surplus quantities of sugar following the determination of such quantities at a national level for each new Member State. In that respect, it should be also noted that an appropriately established identification system would help the new Member States to reduce potential charges for their budget by compelling operators responsible for building up individual surplus quantities of sugar to eliminate surplus such quantities in the above-mentioned time-limit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There is a Commission proposal to impose the 4% of national GNI capping rule on the new Member States as an upper limit for the Union's financial assistance during the next financial perspective. Given that a country or a region is eligible for assistance from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund, this proposal effectively means less assistance to the poorer regions and countries, compared with the similar but more prosperous regions and countries. This is inconsistent with the goals of the regional policy to reduce regional disparities. During the hearing at the European Parliament, Budget Commissioner Ms Dalia Grybauskaite noted: 'The 4% figure is not a dogma, and it must be possible to discuss it openly and with a certain degree of flexibility'.</p>

<p>(EN)In article 22 of the draft general regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2007-2013, the Commission proposes to maintain the same perimeter for capping the transfers from the Community budget at 4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of each recipient Member State.</p>
<p>The justification for this is that transfers from the EU budget to Member States need to take into account of the capacity to effectively utilise these financial resources and the need to respect the principle of additionality and the related pressure on national budgets.</p>
<p>While varying from country to country, the capacity to effectively utilise transfers above a certain level has proved to be a challenge. On average, structural transfers to the largest beneficiaries in the EU-15 have always been well below the 4% level, averaging: 1.4% during the period 1989-1993, 2.0% during the period 1994-1999 and 1.6% during the current period (with the highest level reached at 2.6% of GDP).</p>
<p>Moreover, co-financing and additionality are two key principles of the Union’s cohesion policy. Above a certain threshold, it would become very difficult to respect the additionality principle and EU resources would partially replace national funds.</p>
<p>Data on government investments (gross fixed capital formation) as % of GDP, a good proxy of the nature of expenditure promoted through cohesion policy, suggest that the 4% limit is rarely reached, independent of the phase of the economic cycle or of a country’s stage of development.</p>
<p>While the Commission has no plans to change its current proposal, it supports the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency’ to reach a political deal in June and looks forward to playing an active and constructive role in the final phase of negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0320"></a>

Hence, automatic recognition of these diplomas, which is governed by Directives 77/452/EEC and 80/154/EEC, was not possible.</p>
<p>In order to assist holders of the qualification in question who wish to work in another Member State, bridging provisions have been included in the Council’s Common Position on the Proposal for a Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications (Articles 33, paragraph 3, and 43, paragraph 4),currently under discussion, Inserted at the request of the Polish authorities these provisions would enable the holders of the secondary –level qualification to attend bridging courses aimed at bringing the training up to the minimum requirements of the relevant Directives. Having followed such courses, nurses and midwives would then benefit from automatic recognition. Otherwise, those who do not want to upgrade their training can still migrate under the general system (currently Directive 92/51/EEC; Articles 10 to 15 of the proposed Directive once adopted) as health assistants or as nurses or midwives under Article 43 of the EC Treaty as interpreted by the European Court of Justice (Vlassopoulou/Dreessen, C-340/89, C-31/00).

<p>Since September 2004, Polish MEPs, both in plenary and at meetings of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have continuously drawn attention to problems in the soft fruit and apple market in Poland which have intensified since Poland's accession to the EU. 2004 was a particularly unprofitable year for these fruit producers. They have suffered great financial losses and on many farms the fruit was not harvested as the harvesting costs would have been much higher than income from sales. As the soft fruit harvesting season in Poland is fast approaching, is the Commission in a position not only to assess the market situation, but also to introduce solutions which would improve the situation for these fruit producers in Poland this year?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware that the Polish soft fruit sector had important problems in 2004 due to the low prices of several products. Following the Presidency conclusions concerning the simplification of the Common Organisation of the Market for fruit and vegetables in November 2004, the Commission has already started to carry out an analysis of the Community market of soft fruit intended for processing, with a view to make proposals to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>This work will be completed in the second half of 2005. However, one preliminary result is that the 2004 price fall was preceded by good 2003 prices for example for strawberries and raspberries, as well as an increased production for several soft fruits in Europe and particularly in Poland in 2004. On the other hand, as regards apples, the opinion of the Commission is that 2004 was not an exceptional year neither in the old nor in the new Member States. In this respect, exceptional measures seem not being justified.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Commission, upon the request of Poland, has initiated an investigation concerning the import of frozen strawberries from China and Morocco. As the investigation is still in progress, its result is not yet known, but depending on the results it cannot be excluded at this stage that either anti-dumping measures or the GATT safeguard clause could be applied.</p>
<p>As regards special measures for 2005 for soft fruit, the field of action of the Commission is limited by Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and (EC) No 2201/96. However, the Commission would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the basic instrument of the Common Organisation of the Market for fruit and vegetables is the aid given for regrouping of supply by Producer Organisations. This tool is of particular importance for Poland, where the fruit and vegetables sector is highly fragmented and therefore the bargaining power of producers is very low.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of several very positive and constructive initiatives already taken by Polish producers, such as the Fresh Fruit Poland Group, which are committed amongst others to consolidate the sector, to offer products of the highest quality, to organise advertising campaigns and to build handling centres where quality checks will be conducted.</p>
<p>Should Poland require help in informing producers about Producer Organisations and EU financial assistance linked to this instrument, the Commission can provide financial support and expertise through the TAIEX Office.

<p>On 5 June 2001 the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers adopted Directive 2001/37/EC<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. The directive prohibits the export of strong cigarettes as from 2007. In the expectation that strong cigarettes will be prohibited in the entire world by a convention of the World Health Organisation by 2007, an interim regulation was set up. At present, numerous cigarette manufacturers are preparing to move their production to countries outside the European Union. That way they will be allowed to continue their production of strong cigarettes for export. This will lead to a considerable decline in jobs in the European Union.</p>
<p>Is it possible that by the end of the interim regulation a worldwide prohibition of strong cigarettes will be adopted by the World Health Organisation?</p>
<p>If this is not the case, does the Commission intend to propose an extension of the interim regulation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The yield of toxic subtances allowed in cigarettes marketed in the European Union is limited by the Tobacco Products Directive. The yield per cigarette is at maximum 10 mg tar, 1mg nicotine, and 10 mg carbonmonoxide.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Tobacco Products Directive (2001/37/EC) states that “…as regards cigarettes manufactured within, but exported from, the European Community, Member States may apply the yield limits … as from 1 January 2005 but shall in any event do so by 1 January 2007 at the latest”.</p>
<p>The Directive is not conditional or interim in this regard. An extension is therefore possible only with an amendment to the same legal instrument requiring subsequent transposition in the Member States. The Commission is not considering an amendment to extend the time limit in Article 3.</p>
<p>The transitional period for exports was indeed in part motivated by international discussion in the context of the Framework Convention Tobacco Control (FCTC). The adopted FCTC text does not mention any limits to yields of toxic substances from cigarettes while it clearly calls for regulation of the contents and emissions.</p>
<p>The further development within the FCTC framework will be done through the Conference of Parties that is due to meet the first time in February 2006.</p>
<p>One cannot predict which items will be on the agenda at this stage. However it seems unlikely that consensus on regulating the cigarette yields, or their limitation, could be achieved at this forum before 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission’s first report on the application of the tobacco products directive (Article 11) is due to be adopted in June.</p>
<p>The report will state that the Directive has had important effects in the Community on the tobacco control policy. The report will look into areas such as labelling, measurement methods and ingredients. The issue of the effects on tobacco trade could be covered in the future reports, which are due every two years.</p>
<p>Currently the Commission has no indication that the tobacco industry is moving production from the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission fully subscribes to the view that Fair Trade is a tool for sustainable development and poverty reduction and welcomes the important progress over the past few years in the availability of Fair Trade products. Equally as important as the extent to which labelled Fair Trade products have achieved market penetration has been the resulting growing consumer awareness of the ethical implications of their purchasing choices, including of mainstream products, and this awareness has led to increasing attention being paid by companies to their corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken a number of steps to support and stimulate Fair Trade products. There have been several Fair Trade support programmes under the NGO cofinancing budget lines (around € 7.5 million since 1997). The Commission is ready to consider further support for Fair Trade products, particularly under the heading of awareness of the Fair Trade labels and general information. As a means of strengthening the social dimension of globalisation, the Commission is committed to enhancing its support for Fair Trade, as stated in its Communication on Policy Coherence for Development adopted on 12 April 2005.</p>
<p>Based on the Cotonou Agreement which encourages work on Fair Trade, the Commission is reflecting on whether any concrete incentives could be provided for Fair Trade products.

<p>(FR)The honourable Member mentions criticisms of, on the one hand, OLAF’s independence, and, on the other hand, the transparency of its procedures. He also refers to the shortlisting of applicants for the post of director of OLAF and asks what measures the Commission plans to take with a view to ensuring that OLAF develops into an effective agency which is not out of place in a modern democracy.</p>
<p>With regard to OLAF’s independence, it should be pointed out that neither OLAF nor its Supervisory Committee has suggested that OLAF does not enjoy the necessary independence required to conduct its investigations completely independently. Accordingly, any criticism in this respect would appear to be unjustified.</p>
<p>In February 2004, the Commission adopted a legislative initiative aimed at clarifying the legal framework applicable to OLAF in the course of its investigations, inter alia with regard to the institutions and individuals concerned, and at improving the effectiveness and swiftness of the investigations, whilst fully maintaining the Office’s operational independence.</p>
<p>Before it resumes the legislative process, in its original form or following amendments, the new Commission, like Parliament and the Council, would prefer to await the outcome of the special report by the Court of Auditors, which is nearing completion, and the outcome of a Committee on Budgetary Control (COCOBU) hearing set to take place in July. This would enable Parliament and the Commission to take a closer look at their options for strengthening OLAF’s legal framework.</p>
<p>The Commission has already answered a number of written parliamentary questions on the procedure for shortlisting applicants for the post of director of OLAF and wishes to point out that everything has been put in place to ensure that the shortlisting and selection processes are carried out rigorously.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to reiterate that, since the outset of the procedure, it has endeavoured to be as transparent as possible, by advertising posts in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the major national newspapers, and by inviting the Supervisory Committee to take part as an observer in the shortlisting process, which is currently being carried out by the Commission. The institutional partners are also kept informed.</p>
<p>The vacancy notice was approved by the Commission before it was published. The selection criteria in this notice are more rigorous than in 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully committed to respecting the provisions of Regulations 1073/99 and 1074/99 while, at the same time, following the standard Commission recruitment process to the extent they are compatible with these provisions. On request the full list of applications will be made available to the Supervisory Committee. The Supervisory Committee has also been invited to participate in the pre-selection panel’s work as an observer.</p>
<p>Once a favourable opinion has been given by the Supervisory Committee, the Commission will draw up a list of qualified candidates. After consulting Parliament and the Council with a view to seeking an agreement, the Commission will nominate the Director.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0337"></a>

It has also ruled that restrictions based on such grounds and on the need to preserve public order must be suitable for achieving those objectives, inasmuch as they must serve to limit betting activities in a consistent and systematic manner. Therefore, although it has not explicitly ruled about the maintenance of a betting monopoly, it has ruled that such a regime as for any other limitations to betting activities must comply with these conditions.

<p>(FR)Following the 2004 Spring European Council, the Commission called for a period of in-depth reflection on ways of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy. Although some progress has been made, the ambitious objectives set in 2000 could clearly not be met without increased action and commitment on the part of those involved. In its report of November 2004, Mr Kok’s high-level group presented an analysis of the current challenges and the need for such a relaunch of the strategy, along with other points to be considered. It was in this context that the new Commission proposed a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy in February, a proposal which was endorsed by the Council in March, and which received very broad support in Parliament.</p>
<p>The proposed new partnership for growth and employment is based on the idea of a new contract between the Commission and the Member States, and seeks to step up cooperation and to set out clearly who is responsible for what. The Commission’s role as both a driving force and a support mechanism remains at the heart of the process and is thus reflected in the February proposals and the integrated guidelines recently adopted by the Commission, which provide the strategic framework for action on the part of the Member States. Within the framework of a new form of governance that seeks to increase the sense of responsibility and commitment among the Member States by means of preparing their own reform plans and within the framework of a simplified follow-up system, the existing multilateral supervision mechanisms have been retained. The Commission is soon to publish its Community action programme on growth and employment, which will act as a counterpart to the national plans that the Member States are due to submit to the Commission this autumn. This is the evidence of the Commission’s political desire to implement this strategy that is so crucial to our future and that, I am convinced, will prove successful.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0339"></a>

<p>(EN)1. EC assistance to Belarus</p>
<p>The Commission has intensified its efforts with regard to assistance to Belarus in order to meet the challenges arising from the self-isolation of Belarus. The Commission will increase its assistance to Belarus from around €10 million annually to around €12 million in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>This increase in funding is channelled via the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) programme and the Decentralised Cooperation budget line (in total € 2,2 million additional and new funding for civil society organisations have so far been made available in 2005 alone, based on the budgetary allocations in 2004-05). In addition, the Commission is proposing that a further €2 million be transferred from the original budget foreseen for Tacis to the EIDHR.</p>
<p>The Tacis national programme addresses the needs of the population in Belarus. The Belarus Tacis national indicative programme (now with a total of € 8 million for 2005-06 in view of the envisaged transfer of €2 million to the EIDHR) has been revised in line with the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) November conclusions on Belarus. It will finance projects related to civil society, social sector, health, environment, higher education as well as to the alleviation of problems in Chernobyl affected regions.</p>
<p>The EC Delegation in Kiev with its Tacis Branch Office in Minsk is responsible for the implementation of EC assistance to Belarus. The civil society projects are implemented by non-governmental organisations. The selection of projects for EC funding is carried out via open Calls for Proposals.</p>
<p>2. Independent radio broadcasting project</p>
<p>Indeed, independent media sources at large need support in Belarus. Information dissemination regarding the benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy to the Belarusian people at large is a goal for which the Commission is working. The Commission has received several project proposals on international broadcasting to Belarus. The Commission is currently assessing the possibilities to support independent broadcasting to Belarus.</p>
<p>3. Extension of the visa ban</p>
<p>Last year the EU introduced a visa ban against the Belarus officials “who are responsible for, but failed to start, the initiation of independent investigation and prosecution of the alleged crimes and those who are considered by the Pourgourides Report to be key actors in the disappearances of four well-known persons in Belarus in 1999/2000 and the following cover-up, in view of their apparent obstruction of justice”, as well as against those “who are responsible for the fraudulent elections and referendum in Belarus on 17 October 2004 and those who are responsible for severe human rights violations in the repression of peaceful demonstrators in the aftermath of the elections and referendum in Belarus”.</p>
<p>The Commission does not a priori exclude a careful consideration of possible further selective restrictive measures.

<p>The i2010 strategy aims to exploit the opportunity for economic growth and jobs in Europe by promoting an open and competitive digital economy. A key element of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, i2010 offers a comprehensive strategy for the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and media sectors. i2010 is planned as a self-standing initiative, which combines and integrates the available information society policy tools: regulation, research and deployment.</p>
<p>i2010 builds on a comprehensive analysis of information society challenges. Drawing on wide stakeholder consultations, the Commission proposes three priorities for Europe’s information society policies:</p>
<p>the completion of a Single European Information Space which promotes an open and competitive internal market for electronic communications, media and content;</p>
<p>strengthening Innovation and Investment in research to promote growth and jobs;</p>
<p>achieving an Inclusive European Information Society that prioritises better public services and quality of life.</p>
<p>In its forthcoming communication, the Commission will propose key initiatives for each of these priorities, with a series of measures and stimulation policies in order to make sure that economic and social developments go hand in hand.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0348"></a>

<p>The legislation, notably the General Product Safety Directive and its Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) for dangerous products, aims at ensuring that only safe consumer products are placed on the EU market.</p>
<p>When a dangerous consumer product is identified by a national market surveillance authority, a notification with the relevant information is sent to the Commission, which examines and diffuses it to all Member States though the RAPEX system.</p>
<p>In the case of the dangerous steam iron, the Commission diffused the information on the same day of the notification. All Member states were immediately informed, as well as all interested parties, since a specific warning was published on the Commission Consumer Protection Web site.</p>
<p>Apart from such a dramatic example, the RAPEX system receives and diffuses information on dangerous products on a daily base. A weekly report of those presenting a serious risk is published on the Commission Web site.</p>
<p>These reports show that the system, without being absolutely perfect, works efficiently against dangerous consumer products including those imported from China.</p>

<p>The plans for the construction of a new network of gas pipelines running from the Russian Federation along the Baltic seabed, known as the North European gas pipeline (North Transgas), are a cause for major concern. Reservations about this project stem from the fact that, to date, no analyses have been made of the potential environmental damage to a closed marine environment like the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The Baltic is a shallow sea with low water exchange and is thus highly susceptible to accumulation of harmful substances in the water. Given that it is a unique and unusually sensitive ecosystem, it has been classified by the International Maritime Organisation as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The purpose of granting this status is to reduce the risk of oil pollution occurring in the event of maritime accidents. The fact that the Baltic has been recognised as a particularly sensitive ecosystem prompts the question of whether the planned investment in the construction of a gas pipeline might not have an adverse impact.</p>
<p>In connection with the plans to build a North European gas pipeline, what is the Commission's position on protecting Baltic Sea flora and fauna?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)In the context of the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue, the development of the Shtokman field and the pipelines to link it into the EU market, including the Northern Trans-European Gas Pipeline, have been considered to be “Projects of Common Interest”. This pipeline is also recognised as a project of common interest of the trans-European Networks for energy. It would link Russia under the Baltic Sea to northern Germany, then across Germany to the Netherlands and then on into the UK and would be an important new route for supplying additional quantities of Russian natural gas to the EU.</p>
<p>To date, the project is at a very early stage. Extensive feasibility studies, including all relevant environmental aspects will be required before a final decision on its construction can be taken. It goes without saying that the companies concerned will have to demonstrate the compliance of the project with all relevant environmental legislation. In particular, Directive 85/337/EEC on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private projects on the Environment (EIA Directive) as later amended by Directive 97/11/EC, the Birds (79/409/EEC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives applicable to EU Member States would have to be complied with. The existing provisions for cross-border EIAs, such as the Espoo convention when applicable must also be respected. No technical feasibility study on the project involving the European Commission’s funding has been conducted until now.</p>
<p>Finally, in recognition of increasing threats facing the marine environment, the EU’s 6<span class="sup">th</span> Environment Action Programme included a commitment to develop a Thematic Strategy for the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment. The Commission is in the process of finalising the Strategy which is due to be adopted later in 2005. The Strategy will provide a framework through which all the impacts and pressures on the marine environment – including from gas pipelines and other developments linked to oil and gas exploration and transport - can be addressed in an integrated manner in order to promote sustainable use of the seas and more effectively conserve marine ecosystems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
