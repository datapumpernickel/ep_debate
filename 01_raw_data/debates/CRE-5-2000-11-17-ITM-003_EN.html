<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports. I believe this is an important report, and I am therefore proud and happy that it is to be debated and voted upon on a Friday, for Friday is a working day like any other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the view that, as a European Parliament, we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a European Police College under way. As you know, the idea came about in 1995 at a professional convention in Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria and was unanimously adopted in 1998 by this Parliament in the context of a report on internal security and eastward enlargement. At the time, we were concerned with the important matter, which we are finding ever more pressing, of not only having to get the applicant countries ready economically for accession but also of having to ensure, above all, that the framework conditions in terms of democracy, constitutionality and administration were right. On reading the latest progress reports, we note that there has been a considerable improvement in the way in which the legislation has been transposed. However, the way in which the legislation is applied in the applicant countries is still problematic because it is huge task, after decades of dictatorship, to construct new police forces, new systems of justice and new public prosecution authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we produced at that time, we said that, in those countries which had found their way to democracy through their own efforts, we wanted, after decades of police States, to see the training of police who did not only genuinely accept the standards of European democracy but were also prepared to act in partnership. That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose. This idea of Parliament's was then adopted at the Tampere Summit, and I am very grateful to the Council for adopting this project, originated by Parliament, as its own. I am especially grateful to Commissioner Vitorino who has shown his vigorous commitment to a European Police College, something which also finds expression in the fact that the Portuguese government, which thinks along similar lines to himself, has thankfully seized this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the will of the Council and of that of this Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the European Police College is to become a reality as early as next year, more precisely as part of a network of national police training institutes with a joint remit, joint leadership and joint training programmes. However, we want this only to be a first step and we want an actual Police College to be set up within no more than two or three years. In this context, I should like to refer to a valuable comment by the French Presidency of the Council which said that we need a common, actually existing Police College of this kind in order to create a European culture of police training.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint training of this kind is urgently needed when it comes to protecting external borders and combating cross-border crime and also when it comes to applying human rights standards in the European Union. It also has very wide support from police trade unions and professional associations. They know that, in the border area between the current EU and the applicant countries, such as in Eastern Bavaria, a great many towns have already asked for such a Police College. I am of the view, however, that it is still too early to make a decision on the matter. Naturally, that would be the best place for it to be located. It is now firstly a question, however, of actually creating this Police College, and all political forces are together helping to achieve this goal. I would thank the Bavarian and German ministers of the interior, as well as former Austrian Minister of the Interior Schlögel, who together made this possible back in Tampere. I believe this is a one-off opportunity to create a Europe in practical terms, namely a constitutional Europe that does not just exist in some documents or other but finds expression on an everyday basis. As the European Parliament, we can be proud that this is one of our own ideas and initiatives, which is to become a reality in just a few months’ time.</p>

This is a cause to which he has demonstrated his ongoing and productive commitment. We have before us a very useful instrument which will allow us not only to optimise police cooperation between Member States but also to improve cooperation with candidate countries and with Norway and Iceland.</p>
<p class="contents">This police cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the very important objective of affording European citizens a high degree of security within the European area of freedom, security and justice. The intention of the Portuguese Presidency in presenting this initiative, following the Tampere conclusions and in order to meet the deadlines laid down in the ‘scoreboard’, was to initiate the preliminary stage of the European Police College by creating a network of the national institutes already existent in each Member State in order to improve the training of senior police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, we are beginning to train the next generation of police officers to work and operate throughout Europe; in other words, we will be preparing them to implement Community law and joint and Community actions. This will be a kind of virtual police academy, whose task will be to improve mutual familiarity with the Member States’ national police systems and structures, to increase familiarity with international instruments and to optimise cooperation and coordination between the College and the other European multinational police training institutes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no doubt that it will be easier to reach consensus at this first stage. The transition to the second stage, that is, the institutional and physical creation of the future European Police College, is bound to raise some problems. We know that there are still a number of Member States that support the creation of the College only as a permanent network of national institutes, but we feel that the majority will accept this proposal as a temporary stage that will make it possible to create a tangible institution within a maximum of three years. This is also the proposal that the Commission supports, which has been so vigorously advocated by Commissioner Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People’s Party. The rapporteur goes even further, proposing that the deadline should be brought forward to two years; as soon as the proposed objectives can be achieved, it would certainly be in the common interest to be able to relax the deadlines in order to give substance to the area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the report by Mr Posselt, who has done some sterling work, it is a fact that judicial and police cooperation is new territory for the European Union and that every proposal that comes up for discussion marks progress. The Tampere conclusions clearly expressed the need to set up a European Police College. I believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have enriched the proposal put forward by the Portuguese Presidency. For example, we believe that police training should not be confined to cross-border police cooperation and to combating crime, but should cover other areas of policy, such as human rights, the provision of services to citizens, the use of new technologies, non-repressive law enforcement, crime prevention methods, respect for the rule of law, and knowledge of the political and socio-economic developments in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these areas, the police college can play an important role by promoting more effective practices and up-to-date methods, either in the form of a network coordinating national training establishments, or as an actual college with a permanent seat. Naturally priority should be given to the countries with which the European Union is conducting accession negotiations. The enlargement of the European Union, which will extend the space in which citizens are free to move, should be accompanied by supplementary measures ensuring safety and peaceful co-existence among the Member States. The candidate countries must not delay their full integration in the third pillar of justice and home affairs. To this end, they must establish specific frameworks for cooperation between the European Police College and the police forces in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the European Parliament has an exclusively advisory role in all this. But the establishment of new European infrastructures will necessarily impact on the lives of its citizens, especially in relation to matters of policing. That is why I would like to call on the Council, which I believe is absent today, to carefully study the amendments we have tabled and to pay serious attention to the opinion of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just have a few reservations with regard to the name. The term ‘police academy’ makes me think of a humorous American TV series about the police. What is more, I find the word ‘academy’ is not assertive enough when it comes to police operations. That is just a minor detail, of course. I think that it is more important to confine ourselves to the essentials.</p>
<p class="contents">Social conditions in most Member States of the European Union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross-border cooperation between the various police forces. Cross-border cooperation can only lead to results if a number of conditions are met, if the greatest care is taken over appropriate, goal-directed programmes for ongoing training, if attention is paid to training regarding the Member States’ response to crisis situations in third countries and if exchanges and secondments are made possible in a professional way, with the emphasis on the professional aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention must also be paid to training at European level with regard to crime prevention, maintenance of public order and efficient border control. On the other hand, a European Police College needs to become the forum for gaining an understanding of the various national police systems and defending the knowledge they have.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I hope that there will be no delay in giving concrete expression to this initiative which, to my mind and also in my Group's opinion, answers the need to bring about a European training structure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These rights are very differently interpreted in different parts of the Union. I come from a country in which the maximum period of detention allowed by law is 110 days. After 110 days of detention a person, if not tried, must be released and never tried for that offence again.</p>
<p class="contents">From what I see, conditions in French and Portuguese jails are very different. People can be kept for enormously long periods of time awaiting trial. We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points.</p>
<p class="contents">This connects exactly to our culture of policing. Do we have a culture of policing in which the idea is to detain people as briefly as necessary, find the evidence as quickly and expeditiously as possible and get trials moving forward, or do we have a system where people do it as it suits them best? If we could develop a common culture of policing in Europe, and if it were based on best practice, then that would be a fine thing. But, as I have said in another debate this week, the danger is that we develop a kind of general casualness, we have moved to the lowest common denominator, not the highest common factor. Let us make sure that if we have a police college it is, as Mr Posselt's report stresses, grounded in the need to develop and enhance respect for human and civil rights in our police culture. Police efficiency is not just to do with grabbing guys and putting them inside. It is to do with finding the people who actually commit crimes and proving the case against them in a civilised way, with a proper connection between prosecution services and police services. If we can get a police college for the whole of Europe to do that or begin to develop this kind of common culture that would be a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college. I see the need for a permanent seat for its administration but I want Members of the House to think seriously about whether, in the interest of a common police culture in Europe, it would be better to take everybody to one place or to have courses which move year-by-year or subject-by-subject to different police colleges and academies in different parts of the Union. That way, people begin to appreciate differences of local assumption, differences of local approach. We hope that over time our police forces will genuinely learn from each other and learn best practice from each other, not worst practice. If that could be done we would have a police academy of which we, as Europeans, might be proud. I hope that will be the result of this excellent proposal and this excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The questions arise, however, of what this College is for and of what tasks and objectives it has. To take just one point, Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards'. That is when things already begin to get difficult. What are these common standards? As you know, Mr Posselt, police duties in the Federal Republic of Germany are a matter for the individual Länder, which are absolutely sovereign in this area. Now, compare the various Länder’s laws on police duties. You will see that, in Brandenburg (unlike in Berlin), de-escalation is the supreme precept when it comes to deploying police and that, under Brandenburg law, any police who are to be deployed are obliged to be identified by name so that anyone who might be attacked in a demonstration can read the name of the policeman concerned and know who it was. In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area. A College along these lines is not really needed just for the purpose of exchanging different types of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">You speak about establishing public order. All right, that is accepted. Again, the only question is, with what resources? In the Federal Republic of Germany, even public order is defined completely differently in the various Länder’s laws relating to police duties. What do you understand to mean by public order? You write in your report about border control services. I ask you! We make a perfectly clear distinction between duties relating to the protection of Federal borders and the duties of the police. (In other States, it is different.) If you write in those terms, then before what you say can be approved, it must first be clear what common activities are planned and according to what standards one is going to proceed. As long as such matters have not been clarified, I have to say to you in all honesty that I myself cannot consent to the basic idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet another interim but not so short-term<span class="bold"> </span>decision, another little present to Parliament from the Council. Just as Europol grew out of the "Drugs" unit, so the seed of judicial cooperation will produce Eurojust and maybe a European prosecution service. We can therefore safely say that a lightweight and currently practically non-existent structure such as the European Police College will give rise to yet another bureaucratic structure, almost as if it were in the genetic code of the European Union to entwine policies in red tape. It is clear, blindingly obvious and even banal to state that it is necessary to fight organised crime operating at transnational level with transnational policies, just as it goes without saying that national police forces need to be trained in order to be better equipped to tackle the cultural, legal and linguistic crime issues raised by both European integration and the integration of criminal organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we do not feel that this makes it necessary to create a new structure. The underlying reasons for establishing a police college – reasons which we endorse – could have been better and more effectively achieved by encouraging existing national academies to develop training courses, exchanges, MA courses and specialisations to fill the gap which does, in effect, exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the fact remains that Mr Posselt's work is, in our opinion, excellent. On the other hand, we fail to understand the position of the Socialist Members. Mrs Karamanou has just stated that she welcomes the fact that Parliament will have an advisory role, and yet, only the other day, the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against a motion on the grounds that the Europol Management Board was to include Members of Parliament with the right to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Posselt's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence, and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the Internet. In general, instead of taking advantage of the new economy to develop a new policy of employment structures and organisation, the European Union is still trying to work and organise itself according to last century's criteria.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Farage (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, according to the Council decision on the establishment of the European police college, the aim of the EPC is to help train senior law enforcement officers of the Member States. I note that the rapporteur wants to change "law enforcement officers" to "police", which is probably a good idea. But what also caught my eye is that this training is aimed at supporting and developing a European approach in the field of crime-fighting and protecting internal security. The rapporteur wishes to see added crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and border surveillance and also wants internal security modified to include maintaining law and order.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem I have with these statements is that I am not quite sure what the European approach to maintaining law and order, etc, actually involves. It is not specified in either the Council decision or the rapporteur's report. All I can say, from a strictly British perspective, is that if this means that continental practices are to become <span class="italic">de rigeur</span> throughout Europe, our own police force will be taking an unhealthy interest in armoured cars, water cannon, tear-gas launchers and dinky little pistols which they can swing from their already over-laden belts.</p>
<p class="contents">This apart, it is something of a surprise to find that there is even such a thing as a European approach to crime fighting. I am absolutely certain that it will come as a rude shock to most of the British population that internal security is an area where there is any room for involvement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It will probably come as an even greater shock for them to learn that the European Parliament wants the European police college to be responsible for training police forces and border control forces – that is to say customs and excise – in order to prepare them for the use of Community law and the implementation of common and Community measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There it is: Community law and common and Community measures. The cat is out of the bag. Clear as day we can see the ambition of the EU naked in tooth and claw; a common approach – the European approach – to fighting crime and internal security; one people, one law and one police force. I am sure that the European Union will be far more subtle than this. Our police force will retain their uniforms, right down to the comforting woolly pullies that they have taken to wearing. The ranks will be the same and the local badges will be untouched. From all the outward signs the facade will be unchanged but, under the expert tutelage of the European college, they will be working to a different agenda: a European agenda, applying Community law and Community measures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is such a far cry from the Common Market which the United Kingdom joined in 1973. No-one in the UK would ever have believed a soothsayer from that period who warned that it would all end up in Dixon of Dock Green whistling "Ode to Joy" and working out how to apply the European approach to policing down at the nick.</p>
<p class="contents">But here we are in Strasbourg in a near-deserted Chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable. Our own Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, his Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook and other British ministers may deny that a superstate is on its way, but when I hear proposals for our own police forces to be trained in a European approach to crime fighting and internal security, it is obvious that the writing is on the wall. As you can probably gather, I will not be supporting this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If he reads the records of some of the representatives from his own Member State, the United Kingdom, in those days they were extreme left-wing socialists who forecast everything which seems to scare him with the same hysterical sort of attitude to European Union. They forecast all the things which seem to frighten him today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a different part of the political spectrum, it is very interesting to hear him repeat, with the same hysteria, the same concerns. Their capital in those days was Moscow or Budapest. Those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for. However, I am glad to say that attitudes in the Labour party in Britain have changed.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mr Posselt for his report. The work we do on a Friday morning in Parliament has the same legitimacy as the work we do on a Monday or any other day. Indeed it was commented that on Wednesday evening when the Commissioner spoke about BSE, somebody drew attention to the fact that there were only 17 people in the House. There are a lot more people here this morning and I will regret the passing of Friday when we can carry on a real debate and respond to each other and take the time to listen to each other. Parliament and democracy in Europe will be the poorer for the shortening of the Strasbourg week.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I welcome this proposal. Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy originated here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese presidency for taking it up and the Commission and Council for their support. It is a good idea and in the European Union where people have freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the right of establishment, where travellers from Scotland can go to Sicily or Greece, it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That common approach is not there at the moment. I come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situation – a civil war. But the people at that time established, very wisely, an unarmed police force that is very socially engaged with the communities in which they live and work. You might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order. When I come to continental Europe I am a bit surprised at the way police distance themselves and adopt what appears to be a harder attitude. I will welcome a levelling-out of standards in some Member States in the European Union. All of us have experienced abuses in our own countries. I hope that this academy will help us to have a better understanding of the whole system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since border controls within the European Union disappeared, they also no longer take any notice of state boundaries. Cross-border crime requires a cross-border approach. Because everyone agrees about that, closer cooperation between the police from the different Member States and their regions has already been worked on for years. Three days ago, following publication of the Marinho, Karamanou and Roure reports, I pointed to the dangers attached to this. An enlarged and centralised police force, disconnected from its surroundings, will look for its own priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a European Police College is based on the assumption that there is agreement on the tasks and modus operandi of the police. We see that the police in one country react totally differently to the same situation than the police in another country. In the Netherlands, the police are trained in the de-escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities, the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena. I am under the impression that, in some other countries, violence is still used as a method of winning prestige, on behalf of the government, in combating everything that can cause unrest.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the contribution made by President De Gaulle to establishing peace in Algeria was held up by Mr Posselt as a model for the role which Mr Kostunica will have to play in order to solve the Kosovo problem. He also cited the situation in which Hitler could claim that he could exterminate the Jews without being punished because, after all, nobody remembered the mass murder of the Armenians any more. At such moments, I can agree with Mr Posselt to a very large extent. On the other hand, we shall probably remain permanently in disagreement about the vision for the police.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer a small-scale, trained and organised police force, constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the rapid progress made both by the Portuguese Presidency, which launched this initiative, and by the French Presidency, which intends to adopt it by the end of the year. I therefore feel that the efforts made by us all will have made it possible to effectively create the European Police College just one year after the decision taken by the Tampere European Council. I should also like to congratulate and thank the European Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and particularly its rapporteur, Mr Posselt, not only for his personal commitment but also for the excellent study that he has produced and for the way in which he has pushed for the creation of the European Police College.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future of the College, the Commission is – as I am sure you will be aware – of the opinion that Conclusion No 47 of the Tampere European Council laid down, extremely clearly, that the network-style functioning of the College, which is already causing it also to be called a ‘virtual’ Academy, will be only the first stage. Like the European Parliament, the Commission feels that it would be desirable for a formula to be adopted within a practical and clearly defined timescale, ensuring greater continuity of training action or even its development beyond the senior police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make it clear, however, that what we are talking about here is not the creation of a European police force. We are talking about the need to exchange experience and information, to exchange best practices in crime fighting in order to make respect for citizens’ rights and the fight against transnational crime more effective. Above all, I wish to emphasise that, as someone who has always advocated the idea of community policing, which is the method employed in the United Kingdom, I would welcome the fact that this British idea is finding ever more support in a range of countries in so-called “continental Europe”. Whoever believes that the solutions that they advocate are good should not have anything to fear from exposure to other people’s solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that the transition from a virtual police academy or police staff college to a police academy as an institution is not only justified from the point of view of the operational ability of the current Member States’ police forces. It is also justified from the point of view of being able, as early as possible, to systematically include the police forces of the candidate countries in a training strategy. I consider this to be an extremely important priority, not only for the candidate countries but also to ensure that the guarantees that we have to provide for our citizens that enlargement will be accompanied by safeguards for the security of Member States. I should like to assure Parliament that the Commission is willing to continue to cooperate, both with regard to creating the Academy and to ensuring its smooth operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted Mr Posselt’s proposal that, in 2003, the Commission could draw up a report on the College’s future, on the basis of a study produced by its management board. The Commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the idea that Council currently has in mind. The Council wishes the Police College to develop primarily with an intergovernmental approach. Our priority is to see actions in the field of training launched as quickly as possible. The fact that the Commission is not playing a central role in this process, however, does not mean that we will not be paying close attention to the process, doing all that we can to ensure that it is a success, and I am convinced that this project will help to improve security in the area of freedom, security and justice, since freedom and justice can only exist in an environment of genuine security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The establishment of the European Police College is in keeping with the decision taken by the Feira Council to create a mobile ‘expeditionary’ force of repression with police, judicial and correctional powers, which the European Union will use for ‘non-military crisis management’ anywhere on the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially important to stress that the European Police College, which is expected to start its operations on 1 January 2001, is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the Member States of the European Union; it also involves the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Indeed, for greater effectiveness its permanent seat will be close to the border between the current European Union and the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Members of the European Parliament from the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We find the objectives of the proposal are excellent: to establish training programmes for senior officials and staff in the police forces of Member States, but also applicant countries, in all crime-fighting areas necessitating cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think the method adopted for this initiative is perfectly appropriate: we are not going to set up a new European structure liable to be rather divorced from reality at the national level, but rather to create a College in the form of a network made up of the existing national training institutes for senior police officers. Each national unit would accommodate one section of the European Police College. In this way, the College would not be based in any one place, but would be present everywhere. Its governing board would be made up of all the directors of the national institutes, who would therefore have the benefit of full knowledge of the facts when determining their requirements. This arrangement would guarantee the College’s remaining permanently close to grass-roots developments, avoiding any divergence between the approach of the college and that of the national technical experts to actual problems. Moreover, it would be flexible in its organisation, offering great potential for development, with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect. This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call ‘Network Europe’, a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this instrument, which we find perfectly satisfactory, does not seem to appeal greatly to the European Parliament. The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction, emphasising that this is a temporary structure, that the time period for revision must be short, and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation. At this rate, there is a great danger that, in a few years’ time, we will find ourselves with a new costly superstructure that thinks itself superior to the national services, that does not cooperate well with them and ends up not being efficient enough. According to what I have been told, this is the route that Europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the most effective way of working, for the European Police College, as for most of the other areas of cooperation, especially in the police, justice and security sector, is to establish networks between the existing national services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the EU, there is an obvious risk of believing, in area after area, that cooperation is advanced simply through establishing new institutions and authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also object to the fact that the text of recital 7 in the report goes above and beyond the Portuguese Republic's text in demanding <span class="italic">one</span> special <span class="italic">seat</span> for the Police College instead of cooperation on a rota basis. The fact that police powers are proposed in a number of recitals under the directive, together with the fact that common curricula are proposed, I see as moves towards centralisation, with the risk of bad practice getting the better of good practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
