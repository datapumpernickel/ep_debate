I would have thanked both rapporteurs, but I notice that neither of them is here. Their absence is an illustration of the fact that there is room for some improvement in Parliament’s working method. When we have a debate, we should have it without any interruptions. Sadly, that is how it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the gist of the Figueiredo report, and particularly the costs and prevention for the control of animal diseases, as approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Prevention must be improved, and there must be more control, but what is much more important, and far more effective, is to deploy the vaccine as a control product and preventive measure.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, it is essential that we apply the same standards in Europe in terms of cofinancing under the motto ‘what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander’. I am in favour of a 50/50 split between the Commission and Member States, but in terms of Member State contributions, it should slowly become clear who is footing the bill: the Member States or, as is the case in some other Member States, the farmers. Clearly, these discrepancies are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome some of the points of the Parish report. I am pleased by the adoption of our and Mr Berman’s amendment, which states that, in the event of a serious threat of bird flu, the vaccine can be used as a preventive measure without this affecting the market position – and I would like to stress this, also looking at the Commissioner, without this affecting the market position. My group is delighted with this, because it is crucial that we should start to deploy animal disease control products more effectively. Non-vaccination policy has, in fact, run its course. In a world where markets are becoming more open, where people travel, it is no longer appropriate that vaccination should not be used effectively and, above all, that the use of vaccination should lead to restrictions on the market of the products. It is essential for us to go down this route in Europe. That is the only answer to controlling infectious animal diseases worldwide as much as possible and as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my notice that Mrs Figueiredo has now entered the Chamber. I would like to thank her again for the contribution to her report, and I shall thank Mr Parish in person. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Influenza is not a problem faced by individual Member States or by Europe as a whole, but a global problem. Asia has been the starting point for nearly every influenza epidemic. A dozen or so virus strains that could mutate at any moment and pose a threat to Europe have been circulating there for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between organisations such as the WHO, the FAO, the World Bank and leading poultry producers in the USA, Brazil and the European Union is now essential in order to eradicate these hotbeds.</p>
<p class="contents">We have until the end of the year in Europe to draw up a road map and an action plan with a view to preventing an influenza epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do during these few winter months? Firstly, we should ensure that funding is available under the 2006 budget and future budgets for preventive actions. More money should be spent on veterinary measures and on purchasing vaccines for the entire poultry population of Europe, and appropriate quantities of antiviral drugs such as tamiflu should be stockpiled.</p>
<p class="contents">A single blueprint for European veterinary services and authorities responsible for public health should be drawn up. We must develop a strategy for funding and ordering the production of antiviral drugs. A single set of guidelines should be published for the diagnosis of avian influenza and for laboratory diagnostic tests, and a scientific assessment of the epidemiological risk posed to humans by avian influenza should be commissioned. We should facilitate the setting up and funding of several new reference laboratories in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, it is my belief that any future epidemic and panic could be prevented if a road map along these lines were implemented, and if Parliament were to adopt the report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of avian deaths have recently been caused by the virus responsible and many human conditions are being attributed directly to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, HPAI.</p>
<p class="contents">However, avian flu is not a new disease. In fact, it is thought to have been around ever since viruses themselves were discovered and it is most likely to be just as old as the common flu virus itself, i.e. probably many thousands of years old.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat to humans is not new either. Studies using molecular biology techniques indicate that the influenza pandemic which erupted at the end of the First World War was in fact caused by an avian flu virus. That pandemic killed approximately 50 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of interest that, as with most influenza pandemics, the 1918 flu pandemic only lasted for about one year and gradually disappeared in the subsequent period. This happened without the use of antiviral agents, vaccines or radical measures having been taken in poultry farming, but thanks to the most effective means of disease defence called natural resistance. This should perhaps cause us to carefully consider how drastic our precautionary measures should be. This is why I agree with both the Commissioner and the rapporteur that a balanced approach is the most rational to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that any measures we take should be in accordance with nature’s defence mechanisms and not in opposition to them. It is therefore my view that close scientific monitoring of the epidemiology and molecular biology of the avian flu virus is essential. I believe that massive culling of LPAI-infected holdings is not strictly necessary – let us remind ourselves that we have been eating scrapie-infected sheep and goats for over 200 years and no human has yet died from scrapie infections. I am also of the opinion that vaccinations of flocks are costly, cumbersome and perhaps of dubious significance – rather, we should aim at researching and promoting the breeding of naturally-resistant birds. In addition, assistance should be given to developing countries to improve primitive holdings conditions and poultry food hygiene, which is very important. Lastly, the panic-stocking of antiviral drugs of doubtful effectiveness and without proper scrutiny of their sometimes lethal side-effects is not wise. It deprives much-needed resources from healthcare systems and mainly helps further to enrich pharmaceutical companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although a link has now been established with the possibility of its onward transmission, we must not allow ourselves to be panicked, and must not lose sight of the need for coordination between the veterinary and human spheres. We are dealing, after all, in the first instance with an animal disease, and so I find your manifest calm perfectly understandable, for the alternative is to run the risk of being swamped by day-to-day panic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The good thing about the proposal is that it answers the question ‘to inoculate or not to inoculate?’ As you know – and I know all the more, having been in this House for longer – this has been the subject of debate over many years, the issue always being whether vaccination should be ongoing or, alternatively, prophylactic and in response to a specific occurrence of disease. Here in this House, we have always favoured the latter option, which is the one you are now proposing, but it has always been mentioned in the same breath with this fundamental question. The merit of your proposal, though, is that it separates the two.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we endorse your proposal. There is no place either in this debate for such terms as ‘exterminate’ and ‘destroy’; we are dealing here with animals or with food, since it is animals that find their way into food products. The images presented to us over the past years – ranging from BSE to the diseases of poultry and swine via the cullings for foot-and-mouth disease – did Europe’s cultural credibility in the world’s eyes no good at all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what leads me to believe that we are on the right track. The recommendation I would like to give you is that we should join with the Commission in discussing the issue of susceptibility, in relation to which we need to draw a distinction between the new breeds, which are intended for technical treatment and intensive rearing, and the regionally adapted breeds, that is to say those that live in the wild, some of which do indeed carry the virus without becoming clinically ill. The way they coexist needs to be organised, and so we must not fall into the trap of conducting the wrong debate, asking ourselves whether we should now do away with nature and have purely artificial and technical animal husbandry from now on. What is instead needed here is an exchange of views, not only with reference to the European situation, but also carried over into Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is there that we must provide technical aid and around the world that precautions must be taken if animals are to be kept healthy and people such as ourselves protected from the possibility of viruses altering and mutating to our own peril. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The measures proposed in the directive are the right measures. At the same time, however, provision is made for derogations and this is where caution is needed, because this will adulterate the severity of the measures. It will allow large poultry industries attacked by low pathogenic influenza to use the derogations to channel poultry and products to the market which have been attacked instead of destroying them, thereby transferring the disease to importing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If certain countries want to use the derogations, the derogations should be allowed for their area only and they must be responsible for them. The other countries, however, must have the facility to refuse to allow products subject to the derogation to be traded on their territory, because low pathogenic influenza and vaccinated birds may be considered to be of negligible risk to public health, but the low pathogenic virus could mutate into a high pathogenic virus at any moment and, although harmless now, could create dangerous situations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say ‘perceived’ threat because some of the headlines in the media over the last six to seven months suggest that the end of the world is imminent and there is no escape from the dangers and the risks presented by the spread of avian flu.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when you look more closely at the scientific and empirical data available on bird flu, you see certain trends emerging. First, it does not seem to have as great or as damaging an impact on wild birds as it does on domesticated or commercial flocks. Second, the only cases of human transmission of bird flu have been where people were in close contact with commercial flocks. Third, and most important, there is still no known case of transmission from human being to human being.</p>
<p class="contents">As important as it may be for us to be prudent, prepared and aware of any dangers or risks that may present themselves, it is equally wrong of us to be scaremongering as regards any immediate threat and the dangers it presents. To put this into context, more people will die in the European Union from the effects of a strain of TB that is drug-resistant than will be affected by avian flu. On a global scale, more people – especially children – die every day from the effects of malaria than have been killed so far by avian influenza. We must look at these figures and put them into context, and it is important for our response to be reasoned and proportionate to the risks and dangers that actually exist.</p>
<p class="contents">It is wonderful that the scientific committees on public health and animal health are meeting on a regular basis to update one other and exchange information on the outbreaks that have occurred close to the European Union’s borders. In addition to cooperating with the World Health Organisation, we can put in place preparatory plans for dealing with any potential outbreaks.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and other animal diseases, a policy aimed at slaughtering animals is the only sure way of killing off the disease. Horrific as that may seem in a world where so many millions of people are starving because of a lack of food, in the longer term it would appear to be a better and more proportionate response. This is because, although there has been talk of vaccines and preparations for vaccines, we do not know which vaccine will work. We do not know what the exact result of a vaccine will be on the human body when trying to prevent the spread of avian flu, and will not know until such time as we allow our scientific experts to act and entrust this matter to people who know what they are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">I know some of my colleagues here have doubts or worries concerning the credibility or sincerity of some of the people involved in the pharmaceutical industry. However, at every stage in human health development when there has been a need or a desire to respond to a risk to human health, they have come up with solutions and answers, and we should listen to what they have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the guidance and leadership that the Commissioner has given on this issue, and the clear thinking and cool logic which has been shown, is a model that other Commissioners would do well to follow when dealing with other public service issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its aim is to strengthen the prevention of pandemic of bird-origin influenza, reduce health risks, and prevent the potential loss of life. To date, the death toll from bird flu virus is 68 persons who demonstrably caught the infection from birds. However, the entire mankind would be in jeopardy if the virus mutates and acquires the ability to spread among humans.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where cooperation and coordination among the countries is vital. We know that the disease does not know and respect borders, and this is particularly worrying in case of this deadly disease to which people have no antibodies. However, cooperation is required not only at the international level, but also within individual countries between different sectors. All of them, be it agriculture, healthcare, education, or defence, must fulfil their respective tasks in case of pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, emphasise the importance of behaviour of the population. During the first phase of the breakout, people generally lack adequate information. This is when, instead of rational conduct, people are seized with panic and chaos sets in. And these are the worst enemies in similar situations. Behaviour of people is the most effective when they have information and negative past experience – which they already have in connection with a pandemic. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1917 that killed 40 million should give all of us sufficient warning.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent discussion here in European Parliament Commissioner Kyprianou made a misleading statement when he said that he had 25 national action plans on the table. It is not important for us whether you have 25 programmes on the table. What matters is that you have one common and good quality plan to fight the pandemic. The recent verification of the worst possible scenario of the European 25+2 revealed shortcomings exactly in the area of communication between individual national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, many politicians downplay the danger by stating that these are only the tricks played by pharmaceuticals companies, but, on the other hand, the population gains access to information that the state authorities are already identifying sites for mass graves. All of us, healthcare workers, are aware of the shortage of financial resources in the healthcare system of every country. This is why many countries restrict the number of surgeries and create waiting lists. I am afraid that these financially fragile systems will not have sufficient resources to deal with a pandemic. I therefore think that the population should be informed so as to be able to assume a certain portion of the costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the threat posed by hysteria about a so far nonexistent virus is at least of the same magnitude. According to expert estimates, poultry consumption in Hungary has fallen by at least 40%, to an extent that may actually bankrupt this sector. This has occurred in spite of the fact that Hungarian scientists had prepared and successfully tested the vaccine against the current H5N1 virus. In order to avoid hysteria and panic, our most important tasks are to introduce prevention measures effective at Member State level, to make comprehensive and cautious plans, and to act in a determined, considered and coordinated manner in the event of an epidemic. In the spirit of a responsible attitude towards European citizens, the European Union must assume a high degree of solidarity. The coordination of vaccine production capacities and the consolidation of vaccine distribution principles would give citizens of countries with no vaccine production capacity equal opportunities for obtaining the vaccine. Let us not forget that among the 10 new Member States, Hungary is the only country with a vaccine production facility. Therefore it is important that all assistance is given to the country where the first outbreak of the epidemic occurs, even if this country is outside of the European Union, and that action is not hindered by short-sighted national priorities. There is a saying in my country – a friend in need is a friend indeed. I hope we will succeed in avoiding the need, but if we do not, my wish is that the concept of ‘friendship and cooperation between nations’, one of the basic ideals of the European Union, may prove viable when put to test. I would like to express my gratitude to both rapporteurs for tabling this important issue that does not affect the citizens of Europe only. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We salute him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The six questions that the Commissioner sent to the Community health ministers seem to me to be the right ones, but the question remains as to whether he gets the right answers from them in terms of the way we can mobilise our stocks of anti-virals prior to the development of a vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say in passing to Dr Matsakis, whom I greatly esteem, that I do not share his relative happiness with the outcome of the events of 1918. In 1918, death was the firewall that put an end to it; the virus ran out of victims. We cannot be in a situation where we allow that to happen again, and I therefore salute the measures the Commissioner has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just got time for one question: if low pathogen avian flu is also infectious and can mutate, how can we be certain that the import of infected wildfowl and domestic poultry is really under control? In my own country we have had examples of both the former and now today the latter. Large stocks of illegally imported Chinese chicken meat have been uncovered in the UK over the past few days. We know that epidemics run through channels of illegality and deceit – epidemics, not pandemics. Epidemics start that way, so it was with foot and mouth disease. We do not want to see it again and so I hope the Commissioner will be able to say in his summing-up exactly what the measures of preventive scrutiny will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attribution of guilt to one party is just as wrong-headed as, for example, making wild birds responsible for the spread of this disease, for which science has shown and demonstrated other causes. This has, so far, been more of a media event than a medical one in the true sense of the word, if one compares it with many other developments and worse diseases. It does nevertheless need to be prevented, and the Commission cannot be often enough praised for its rational and balanced response.</p>
<p class="contents">We do indeed need to carry on keeping a watchful eye on how things develop, and I hope that all those affected will be involved in the monitoring process. It is a matter of absolute necessity that this should include those who live and work on the ground, including, for example, those engaged in hunting, who have the requisite knowledge and are the first to come into contact with wild birds.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I hope that the report by Mr Parish, who has done a good job, will be adopted tomorrow, and would like once again to congratulate the Commission on its level-headed attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU should also focus much more on the source in South-East Asia. A number of Member States have set up sound bilateral projects over there, and the FAO has played a coordinating role in this. The Commission should build on this by financially supporting initiatives of the EU Member States in South-East Asia and by leaving the coordination to the FAO. That would be the most efficient way of going about things.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thousands of people in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and other countries have been in contact with the virus and obviously, many of them have developed antibodies. There is no data available on this. The Commission could, and indeed should, help fund a study into this very area.</p>
<p class="contents">More can be done within the EU too. Water birds are not nearly monitored enough, which is essential, after all, because the low-pathogenic virus is spread much more widely than imagined. That is not new or unusual, but accurate monitoring is essential. In short, I urge you to support bilateral initiatives of the Member States in South-East Asia, fund research, support the FAO’s coordination and organise more monitoring at European level.</p>

You have also done them, making use of the opportunities for dialogue with other organisations and mounting crisis exercises in Europe, the outcomes of which we shall probably learn about shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only natural – as has already been said – that debate should focus on the health of poultry and the need for that to be protected. I was recently in China, where, as we know, there are 20 billion head of poultry. The Chinese are absolutely terrified of the possibility that bird flu might spread, and they are also doing something about it, but the question arises of whether we Europeans, both in the past and now, have given states like China, Indonesia and Vietnam good enough advice to enable them to take action in the event of any bird flu epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese have now tried to develop anti-bird flu vaccines and they are also working on something for human beings. I think it is splendid that they are now abandoning the old non-immunisation policy and pursuing one of well-ordered immunisation in specific regions or in the vicinity of hotspots. I, in my capacity as a veterinarian, have very frequently been called in, in Lower Saxony and elsewhere, to deal with outbreaks of animal diseases, and I know that the right way to go about a vaccination policy is with marker vaccines – I emphasise that they have to be marker vaccines if at all possible – and this is also, I believe, an approach that is in line with what the enthusiasts for animal welfare would have us do.</p>
<p class="contents">For my final point, let me reiterate what I said as my final point on 25 October, which was that a pandemic is on the way in any case; the scientists do not know when. We should, of course, do everything possible to prevent panic breaking out, while also taking every possible step to prevent the virus being transmitted, mutating and infecting humans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In light of the challenges we are facing, the support of Parliament has been a great encouragement and a great help.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch on a few issues. Firstly, with regard to the issue of research, we are already carrying out and financing research. There is, however, still a lot to be done and that is why my colleague, Mr Potočnik, will soon ask for proposals for further research into the vaccine. We are currently doing this and I agree with Members that we have to develop a better vaccine, which is easier to use, more effective and does not hide the disease and infection.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is still much to be learned about the involvement and effect of migratory and other wild birds in spreading the disease. We have to work on the assumption – as this is what the evidence shows, contrary to what we thought in the past – that the disease is spread by migratory birds. However, it also exists in other species such as sparrows and pigeons in south-east Asia. There is still therefore a lot to be learned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to surveillance, we are using hunters and have asked other groups to also support us in this effort. In addition, we need to know a lot about the virus itself. We therefore not only finance the surveillance programmes and the study of wild and migratory birds, but we will also support the actual research into the virus itself and how it behaves – it is a tricky virus and it changes continuously. Thankfully it has not mutated into a human strain yet, but it behaves in a different way in different birds in different regions. Acquiring as much information as soon as possible is therefore very important.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of vaccination, it is correct that the new legislation changes the approach. We do not discourage vaccination. It can be used if certain precautions are taken. These precautions are necessary as mistakes could lead to serious consequences. Without such precautious, the worst case would be that the vaccine would hide the infection and allow the disease to spread despite the birds having been vaccinated.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had support in the past with Italy. We supported a project and gained important experience, especially with a system that allows vaccinated birds to be distinguished from infected birds.</p>
<p class="contents">There is flexibility in this legislation. It takes into account the current limits of the vaccination. The file has to be properly applied and monitored. This is very important. Nevertheless, we will support research in this field so as to have a more effective and easy-to-use vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the plans, I will not say much about the human health aspects, because we discussed this at length a few weeks ago. I can, however, confirm that all Member States have national plans. Only two days ago we adopted both a Community plan for dealing with a pandemic of influenza and a more generic plan. At the same time, this exercise has proved that there is inter-operability between the plans; we do not have 25 or 27 separate actions. We have synergies and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly always room for improvement. This is why we had the exercise: to identify the weaknesses. The systems worked and that is good. The exchange of information and the communication also worked. In addition, the early warning response system of the Community worked very well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the topic of vaccines and anti-virals, it is indeed true that there are concerns. Not all Member States have reached the same level of preparedness. The industry is not, at this point, in a position to supply the quantities required by the Member States and by the rest of the world. That is why I have been having meetings with the industry and I will report to the Council on 9 December and see how we can improve and enhance the production capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the issue of the low pathogenic form. As mentioned earlier, I know there are some views – I see Mr Parish is smiling – that would also support a stamping-out policy for the low pathogenic form. The Commission takes a different approach. The legislation does not encourage it, this is true, but does not prohibit it either. It therefore gives the Member Stats the option to apply it if they feel that this is the appropriate policy for that specific area, for their own region. We have taken into account the advice of EFSA and ethical concerns as regards mass culls. This is the reason why we reached such a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we take into account the issues of animal welfare and the breeding aspects of animals and birds. You will see this in our animal welfare strategy which will be adopted soon – by the end of the year, hopefully, or early next year. I have to point out, however, that the disease has spread to farms in south-east Asia where animals are bred in a natural way. This has not protected them from the virus.</p>

The more the European Union takes on board the urgency of the situation, the more its citizens will sense that our interference in their daily lives is not merely bureaucratic, but tangible and effective. It is therefore necessary to attain the maximum level of joint financing possible, that is to say 50% for the slaughter of animals infected with the virus and 50% for other expenses in the veterinary sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This sector in Italy produces a very high quality output and employs 80 000 workers. Italy is one of the countries that have not only helped to develop the new vaccine against the H7N1 virus, but are equipping themselves best to face the risk of an epidemic: our Ministry has already provided for complete vaccination coverage if necessary, expanding the veterinary sector and putting in place a labelling system to show the provenance of each product. These measures, which both protect consumers and ensure that consumption recovers, should be given proper recognition at a European level. The Commission cannot take any action against a country protecting its own citizens: health must never come second to the laws of the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
