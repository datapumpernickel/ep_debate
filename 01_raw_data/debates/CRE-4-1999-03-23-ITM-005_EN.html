<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Waddington </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Leonardo Programme has been at the centre of the crisis in the Commission. It has attracted attention, not because of its aims and purpose to be the flagship for the European Union's vocational training policy, but because it has become associated with mismanagement, fraud, secrecy and nepotism. My task as rapporteur has been to help prepare a new programme, Leonardo II. My primary concern has been to ensure the new Leonardo Programme, which is due to begin on 1 January 2000, is of real benefit to the citizens of the European Union; that it makes a contribution to modernising vocational training systems through encouraging mobility, transnational cooperation and dissemination of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Leonardo Programme should be a laboratory of innovation that encourages and enables a wide‐range of partners and trainees to gain access to new opportunities and new ideas. So, my main focus has been on the beneficiaries. It is significant that this Parliament has demonstrated its commitment to its beneficiaries of the programme by continuing to work to investigate, to consult and to propose improvements to Leonardo II despite the crisis in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, or certain parts of it, have let us down and have let the beneficiaries down by not ensuring the efficient and proper administration of the current Leonardo Programme, but I believe that we, as Members of this Parliament, have a mandate to increase opportunity by improving the programmes that are funded by the European Union. I am therefore recommending two amendments to the Parliament after considering the Audit Report and that of the Wise People.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the Socialist Group nor the PPE on the Social Affairs Committee want to see a system perpetuated which allows a contractor to misuse Community resources and then declare itself bankrupt. We are therefore calling for the accountable Commission services to undertake the administrative work for Leonardo II. That is why I have agreed to support Amendment No 34 which could be described as being either Old Labour or New Conservatism or indeed a new third way.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the details of the other amendments agreed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. Firstly, I am pleased to say that the Council has agreed to many of Parliament's amendments which were determined at first‐reading stage. In addition, I understand that the presidency are supporting the spirit or the letter of several of the amendments that have been retabled for this second reading by the Social Affairs and Employment Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which have been retabled cover complementarity between Leonardo II, the European Social Fund and the Employment Guidelines. They give greater priority to life‐long learning as opposed to exclusively concentrating on youth training. They give greater emphasis to access and systems of access to support those vulnerable to exclusion and discrimination including disabled people, and they extend the range of partners to include nongovernmental organisations and SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The re‐tabled amendments also aim to improve evaluation and monitoring systems and streamline and improve the management and decision‐making procedures. In brief, I am aiming at defining Leonardo II as the programme which is concerned with developing vocational training systems for all, an inclusive approach which helps influence and develop training opportunities across the European Union and will link in with the European Social Fund and the Employment Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of these amendments is to prepare for a new programme which is not associated with fraud, but with an increase of opportunity, rigour and transparency. I am also aware of the importance of agreeing these proposals today to ensure there is proper time for preparation for the new programme, and that it starts on time on 1 January 2000. This timetable would not be achieved if we waited until the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force in May. So just as the Leonardo I Programme has been central in illustrating the shortcomings of the Commission structures, this new programme, Leonardo II, and our decisions today will illustrate a new beginning and a determination by this Parliament to continue to work for employment and training opportunities for Europe's citizens.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Velzen, Wim </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Waddington, who has done a splendid job with this report, focused in her presentation on the content of Leonardo, and rightly so. I shall focus on the management of it. The lack of decent management for Leonardo may be seen as one of the root causes of the crisis in which we find ourselves at the moment. So it would be foolish not to spend some time on it in today"s sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be wrong to look at the conclusions to be drawn from the work of the technical assistance offices only in terms of what should happen with Leonardo in the future, since technical assistance offices are a general phenomenon seen in all the directorates‐general. So it seems right and proper to me to draw general conclusions. In effect, those conclusions have already been drawn in the report of the Wise Men, where it says that the Commission should never delegate essential political responsibilities to individuals and that any contracts concluded must contain strict provisions to ensure that the general interest is served at all times and not the interest of the private company. It also says that the authorities must exercise such tight scrutiny that there can be no question of the external advisors being over‐dependent. Mrs Waddington made that point too.</p>
<p class="contents">These are lessons which we think the Commission has to learn, but it would be laughable to talk only of lessons for the Commission. There are lessons here for the European Parliament and the Council too, because one of the lessons to be clearly learned is that budgetary policy is one of the reasons for the crisis. Many things have been called for by Parliament, but there are few resources structured into the budget. I think we have to draw these conclusions clearly in the budget debate and especially in the second reading in September, and that means finding solutions to the problems of the past and it means a bigger budget for recruiting in‐house expertise. That is not to say that I am suggesting a permanent ban on the use of technical assistance offices. If they meet the criteria, they can certainly help to ease the load temporarily.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we find ourselves in a very strange position. Mrs Waddington has dealt mostly with the Council, since the Commission is not functioning for the moment. So a special responsibility rests with the Council. Normally, unanimity is needed in the Council to reject an amendment by Parliament if it is acceptable to the Commission. That situation does not exist at present. It means that the Council could overrule the agreement between Mrs Waddington and the German Presidency. I think that this situation provides grounds for obliging the Council to stand by the agreement it has concluded and thus prevent a unanimous vote in the Council to reject the agreement concluded with Parliament. That is a particular aspect which I think deserves special attention, not only in connection with this subject of our debate but with subsequent ones as well.</p>

What remains the same is the objective. We want to supplement Member States" European vocational training actions and achieve complementarity between them. With a view to making them more effective, we are seeking to network them with other training programmes such as Socrates and Youth, as also with Community initiatives and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Vocational training makes an ideal contribution to innovation, to creating new jobs and to achieving long‐term competitiveness on world markets. However, there are two preconditions: firstly, integrated systems and, secondly, adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Various key concepts remain topical, such as promoting a higher level of vocational training, integrated in our lifelong learning strategy, equal opportunities for men and women, the removal of all forms of discrimination, qualified access to further training and paying special attention to re‐training, to the reintegration of marginalised, disabled and older workers and the constructive dialogue with non‐governmental organisations. It also remains most important substantially to boost the resources for Leonardo, as we have called for. Nobody would seriously question that need, given the new scope, the new duration and the new, much expanded field of application of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">What has, however, changed drastically, is how the programme is implemented, for one of the reasons for the European Commission"s resignation early last week was the mismanagement of Leonardo. The ad hoc committee of inquiry, which is known as the Committee of Wise Men, confirmed in full the findings of the European Parliament"s Committee on Budgetary Control. It found a large number of irregularities which, it said, ‘must be considered an incitement to corruption". The tender procedures were not evaluated on a neutral basis. Instead, organisations that had close links with the clients were given preference as contractors or contracting partners. Think of the times interested parties have complained to us, the responsible Members of the European Parliament, about a number of dubious decisions! Mrs Cresson omitted to inform the President of the Commission or the European Parliament of them. As the Wise Men"s Report also says, and I quote: ‘It is elementary ‘common sense’ that the Commission should have supported the Parliament"s decision‐making process." Facts were indeed kept from us that could have served as background on how to structure the successor programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on Sue Waddington, who has once again done an excellent and detailed job, to support the PPE Group"s amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the Commission, when it implements Leonardo, not to turn to outside bodies but to restructure, Mr Liikanen, and turn to staff from its own ranks. It must remain responsible, must not leave the right to act to others and must undertake to monitor actions and resources carefully. The tasks of national administrative authorities – and this is our second amendment – must also be performed by internal staff and not by third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these amendments the Commission should manage to create transparency and ensure precise supervision of tasks and expenditure. This new departure is worth it for the sake of the vocational future of hundreds of thousands of young Europeans!</p>

The previous Leonardo programme was technically a good one too, and ten times oversubscribed. So there is great interest in this programme amongst the people of Europe. Mrs Waddington has done an excellent job, but that is not the problem. The problem for me is that we are here today as if nothing had happened, as if there were no Committee of Wise Men"s report and as if there were no lessons for us to learn from it. I do not think it would be a wise move to approve this programme today. We still do not know what the European Council intends to do about the future of the European Commission, how quickly solutions will be found to the problems which have arisen, so that they can be consigned to the past. We are again proposing to increase the budget for Leonardo in due course, and I too am in favour of doing that, but on the other hand we still have no guarantee at all that the problems which have arisen will be resolved adequately. So when it comes to the vote, I shall ask for a postponement until April. That is perfectly feasible, because Coreper is meeting on 14 April and there will be time to vote before then. In that event, we shall at least be sure that the European Council takes the crisis seriously and is keen to resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am amazed to find that there is little support for this idea amongst other honourable Members. I cannot understand that, because if we do not vote for a postponement, we shall lose the leverage we have at this time. And my group will face the difficulty of having to choose whether to vote or not. I shall then have to look for a list, and I am not all that keen to surrender my chance to vote. So perhaps we can think of some other means of putting pressure on the Council. But the preferable course and the best political signal we can give is to postpone the vote. I would once again urge the House to follow this course. Otherwise we shall be doing just the same in political terms as we have always done before.</p>

The most troubling aspect of the findings has been the wasted money which has not been used for training. We know that the programmes are always the subject of trade‐offs or rather tussles between the Council and Parliament over the budgets agreed. If we start using the money correctly, we will reap the rewards in effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme has nevertheless been satisfactory. Its purpose is not in doubt but it needs to change, particularly with regard to its priority target groups. If Europe is accused of creating unemployment, it must provide solutions such as the Leonardo programme, which is designed to improve the employability of people and create more companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that the Council and Commission are wrong not to have accepted the amendments giving priority access to this programme for disabled people and allowing special access for the most disadvantaged. The complementary nature of this programme with regard to the ESF has also not been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Why seven years for the programme? Surely this is too long. What purpose will interim evaluations serve if the programme is fixed for so long? Finally, I am sorry to see that once again the common position does not give much room to the social partners in the administration of the programme. In Europe, Leonardo da Vinci is the symbol of creativity and ingenuity. These virtues cannot be said to have inspired the Council and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our citizens do not believe in the added value of Europe and this is to be regretted. We must ensure that Parliament provides the stimulus for the Commission and Council to take the people into account.</p>

During the last discussion we also said that in the interests of Leonardo II it was urgently necessary that Mrs Cresson put her house in order. The situation has turned out to be rather more acute in the meantime, but the house is being put in order. In that respect, we are seeing progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Leonardo II has made it possible to create the European dimension of vocational training, to give access to lifelong learning, not just as a slogan for those who lack qualifications but as an opportunity. Here Parliament has a special responsibility to bring about progress through dialogue with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we have to consider how we can effectively resolve the question of public accountability for the use of public monies. We will not be able simply to fall back on old models of public administration. They are no longer appropriate. We need modern models that also use the instruments of contract awarding. But that cannot mean handing over the money to industry or to mafia‐like structures and letting them manage it themselves. That is bound to lead to the results we have seen. We must put an end to that. We need to return to public accountability. That is the central task to which the Council and Parliament must now apply themselves together and which the new Commission must resolve. I hope the caretaker Commission will take supportive action towards this aim.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maes </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this Leonardo programme is important but has been badly managed. The mismanagement and irregularities which came to light made me keen to go to the courts, for fear of a cover‐up otherwise. Happily that did not happen. On the contrary, things came to a head in the crisis and we now know for certain that this Augean stable at any rate is going to be cleaned out. But we are still not totally reassured, and I would ask the Commission to be especially careful, because there is currently the risk of a real foul‐up and people are hiding behind the fact that the cases, the dossiers, have been sealed by the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there is no follow‐up to the Leonardo programme, and that is not a good thing. The programme is in danger of grinding to a halt because even the applications are not being processed. But the situation can be saved if qualified staff from the former TAOs are put on to the job at once. The argument that the dossiers are sealed does not stand up, since there are duplicates of all files which can be used, provided there is sensible and urgent liaison by the Commission, the trustee and the investigating magistrate.</p>
<p class="contents">In future the practice of TAOs must be avoided as far as possible, if not banned altogether, if only to prevent the operation by these TAOs – under the noses of our own Social Affairs Committee – of a staff policy which is totally at odds with any form of social legislation in the Member States. I would therefore ask the Commission, the Council and Parliament to sit down together and insist that the dossiers are processed, so that a programme which all of us here think is so important can indeed continue in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">‐ firstly, the need for prompt, timely and fully prepared implementation of the programme, which means that the procedure must be completed and the programme must start now; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ secondly, that in the light of the problems which arose with the Leonardo I programme, this preparation must be comprehensive, proper, and carried out with a view to and on the basis of the priorities which have already been discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not ignoring the very important issue of the technical assistance offices. I am not going to mention this matter – not because I underestimate it, but for quite the opposite reason. I think it is an extremely important issue, because it has a bearing on transparency and proper administration. I agree with the debate that has already taken place and with the position of the rapporteur. But I believe that we must not allow this issue to become part of the more general and very important issue which we debated yesterday and which we shall be voting on this afternoon. I would prefer to focus on the importance of the Leonardo programme, since it is linked to the Socrates and Youth programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this principle and the action associated with these programmes, and in the context of the Structural Funds and the Social Fund in particular, we must not lose sight of the priority we are highlighting, which is to promote the message and the means to tackle unemployment through vocational training and to encourage the active and responsible citizen. All the things that unite us culturally will thereby provide the values that are fundamental to the European Union. I believe that the emphasis must remain where it should be, and that the European Parliament must move forward today and finalise its own contribution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pronk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too agree that this programme is very important, and my sincere thanks to Mrs Waddington for all the hard work she has put in on it. In a European jobs market, I think it is most important for people to gain experience of working in other Member States, and that is what this programme makes possible. That is obvious, from the degree to which it is oversubscribed.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall touch on the question of the TAOs, because this is what has exercised us most of late. I totally agree with what Wim van Velzen and Thomas Mann said on the subject. But I think there is something else going on here. The Commissioner told the Committee on Budgets that anyone opposed to the TAOs was in fact ‘old Labour". I felt very strongly, as someone whose grandfather in the Netherlands stood on the Malieveld to prevent a socialist revolution from breaking out in the Netherlands, about being described as ‘old Labour", when there are major questions to be asked about these TAOs. I agree with those who say, and also as Wim van Velzen said, that TAOs are all right in certain cases, but in very restricted cases, in my view. In general, we have a problem with what might be called the core business of government. That was the problem here. When a firm goes under, you then realise the difficulties we face. Everything stops, because a Belgian judge has to decide on something which is in fact a European case. I do not think that is right. How would people feel if, for example, the whole administration of Finland"s social security system was contracted out to Sweden, and the Swedish firm then went bust? I think it might create a few problems in Finland. I believe we should be mindful of this. In creating a TAO we are exceeding the Union"s legal powers, so if a business fails you have to consider how far the Union"s interests may be harmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which is of course very relevant is the question of social security contributions. In ten or so cases, these have either been underpaid or not paid at all. The Commission has not exercised adequate scrutiny here. Vis‐à‐vis the Belgian authorities, TAOs often claim to be part of the EU apparatus, which is not the case because they are subject to Belgian law. That gives rise to a very disagreeable situation. So I think that in this programme certainly, which spawned the whole concept of the TAO, we must not allow TAOs. We cannot afford to. The Council cannot afford to, at least not if it really is intent on cleaning up its act. We cannot afford it, and we must find budgetary solutions to remedy the situation, otherwise things will be impossible. We cannot allow just one TAO to remain. If we do, we lose all credibility, and for that reason we have tabled an amendment. That amendment resolves the matter, I would say, and this TAO will then in any event be reduced to what it is. In this case, the TAO is NBG – it is a bad thing, and we must not forget that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist (ELDR).</span>  – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, this is a praiseworthy report which should promote access to education, employment and experience, combat discrimination and enhance equality of opportunity and the integration of handicapped people into the labour market and working life. It has particular significance for small and medium‐sized businesses and industrial and manufacturing enterprises. It is essential that the labour market partners are included in the cooperation process from the outset in order to reinforce employability, since the whole point of education is to have a job at the end. Together we must each play our part in reducing unemployment and increasing employment opportunities in Europe. It is one of our major tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a totally different system of control and evaluation and of keeping Parliament regularly informed needs to be introduced, as well as openness and transparency, in order to improve the programme's credibility. I think that in reality it would be somewhat challenging to deal on the same day with both the departure of the Commission and the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which was in fact one of the main reasons for its resignation because of the fraud, nepotism and mismanagement associated with the programme. It would seem sensible to postpone a vote until the problems arising from the financial mismanagement of previous projects has been investigated. I hope that others will also realise that this is important, not least in terms of the way in which our work in Parliament is perceived. In any event, our group will stress this aspect before a decision is taken.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Madam President, I am here in exceptional circumstances so I will be very brief. Firstly, the Commission can accept 30 of the 33 amendments tabled to the Waddington report. The amendments which the Commission cannot accept are Nos 12 and 21. With regard to Amendment No 26, which is the major amendment concerning the technical assistance offices, I will set out the Commission's reservations in written form.</p>
<p class="contents">We had discussions earlier in this Chamber on that very point when we talked about budgetary priorities for the year 2000. The position of the rapporteur then was that one should not on principle abolish all technical assistance offices but should guarantee that they do not exercise public sector tasks. We have been working on the general rules of that area and I would just like to say that it is clear that the ways the technical assistance offices have been used have been too vague and they have exercised two different tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to arrive at a situation where the task given to the technical assistance offices could be clearly defined: the rules for unprofessional conduct, the rules on the correct management of funds and – last, but not least, the very important important made by Mr Pronk – that there should be an external authorised auditor on every technical assistance office to guarantee that all national legislation is being fulfilled. This would create a different basis for their function. But I do not want to go into detail on this discussions. We must come back to that in other contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear that in the short and medium‐term we need some solutions for those tasks which are temporary and short‐term and which must be done quickly. For the European public administration we must transfer those which have the element of decision‐making, where political power, so to speak, is being held. I will give the details on that position to Mrs Waddington later.</p>
