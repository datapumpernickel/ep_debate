Italy is therefore keenly aware of the moral and intellectual responsibility and honour of presiding over the Union in this constituent period, when we need to hold on firmly to the lessons of the past in order to build the future, to deal with new developments and seize opportunities that were previously unimaginable, and to overcome differences by finding new solutions, which in turn will enrich our shared project.</p>
<p class="contents">With the full accession of new Member States and the attendant redefining of our identity, it is time to recognise the value of the art of negotiation. Europe as we know it, as built by its governing classes, is the product of enormous determination and brilliant intuition, which have given a spirit and language to shared values and feelings; these have brought together and revitalised the separate strands of national history, traditions and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of today is great: it owes its greatness to its achievements, to its potential, to its proud contribution to peace and international law, but it owes its particular greatness to the specific technical expertise which it has brought to bear, overcoming every crisis, clash of interests and difference in vision by applying a common method, common rules and a common approach to adjusting both method and rules to the realities of a changing world.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there is sometimes a price to be paid for negotiation and that it may be high. If it is not driven by the enthusiasm of shared goals, negotiation can look very much like bureaucratic paralysis, a long and extenuating process of avoiding problems and procrastination. The Italian Parliament, which has never feared the truth, has been acutely aware of the bouts of fatigue and the tendency to sell Europe short which have at times characterised our common European endeavour, and it has condemned those tendencies with frank, pro-European zeal. With the self-confidence born of long experience and the humility needed to tackle crucial political issues, Italy will therefore do everything in its power and everything it feels is necessary to provide Parliament, the Commission and the governments of the European Council with the environment most conducive to taking informed, calm and responsible political decisions on our future. The purpose of negotiation is, indeed, to enable decisions to be taken on substance, and the measure of our success in settling our differences will be whether it enables us to make a great leap forwards and to give our gradually integrating economies, our cultures, our foreign policy and our defence policy a new and efficient institutional shape.</p>
<p class="contents">A great Europe needs great institutions. If the world calls for Europe to act authoritatively in tackling today's major challenges – the fight against terrorism, the reduction of inequalities and imbalances, world economic recovery – it is our duty to respond with a Union which can act decisively and therefore exert influence, a Union which can take resolute, clear decisions on the basis of a clear grasp of the common interest and commonly held convictions which are above any form of particularism. This Union, which we have decided to build together, whose shape has also been discussed during the splendid work of the Convention chaired by Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and benefiting from the vigorous contribution of the Greek Presidency and representatives of the Commission, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments, can only be founded on the framework of values and historical experience that, for over half a century, has bound us to that other great exponent of modern liberal democracy, the United States, co-founder with us of the Atlantic Alliance. If this web of different partnerships – at a different level of political integration – is again to live up to its ambitions and its civilising achievements, for the sake of peace and world security, relations between States must cease to be conducted in monologues and, instead, we must seek to reinstate open, genuine, honest dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can be cured of its Hamlet syndrome and decide to become a wholehearted, active player on the world stage; it can acquire the diplomatic, economic and military means to perform that role convincingly, without jeopardising its autonomy, its roots or the great freedom-giving structures defended over the years within the framework of its Western alliances. As we found at the recent Summit in Thessaloniki, there is deep, shared understanding of this, set out in the very valuable document coordinated by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, which seeks, in a new strategic vision, to overcome the differences that have emerged over recent months with regard to the tragic crisis in Iraq and developments in the crucial issue of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy knows that it is not alone in venturing once more to wager on successful negotiation in order to move the situation forward. In the European Parliament, under its President, Pat Cox, and in the political groups with which we had an enjoyable, valuable meeting in Rome, we feel we have an attentive, patient partner but one which would not fail to hold us to account for our mistakes. In the Commission and its President, Romano Prodi, we see the essential link ensuring continuity in the administration and day-to-day coordination of our institutional system. The European Council, in both the reinvigoration of the plan for growth, based on large-scale investment in civil infrastructure, and the great constitutional opportunity presented by the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, will be the forum in which this six-month Union Presidency, which falls to Italy, will seek to define a bold but not reckless agreement on the major issues of institutional balance, the extension of qualified majority voting, the limits of the common foreign and security policy and the European area of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot overlook the fact that Member States' views on some of these questions still differ. The Italian Presidency will do its utmost to bring about convergence of these positions although it is fully aware that the debate on the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty cannot be completely reopened. The Intergovernmental Conference will therefore have to focus its efforts on the genuine points of contention still outstanding. This ground plan has also dictated the Presidency's goal of adhering to the timetable suggested by the Thessaloniki European Council. Thus, we will open the Intergovernmental Conference in October and keep the proceedings to a tight schedule with a view to reaching agreement by December.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will be involved in the work of the Conference in the most appropriate manner. I call upon the European Council to involve the President of the European Parliament in the work of the Prime Ministers and Heads of Government on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the General Affairs Council to involve the representatives of the European Parliament in their work on a permanent basis. The proceedings will be conducted at a senior political level in order to avoid the impetus provided by the Convention getting bogged down in detailed diplomatic negotiations, as has happened in earlier Intergovernmental Conferences. With this in mind, I undertake to return here to address you after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the day after the December European Council, so that we can review together what has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal is to enable the future Constitutional Treaty to be signed sometime between 1 May 2004 (the date on which the ten new Member States will officially join the Union) and the elections in June 2004 for the next Parliamentary term. Any extension of the negotiations beyond those dates would mean dissipating the precious store of constitutional wisdom developed by the Convention; it would also involve asking European voters to elect their Parliament without knowing the institutional shape of the future Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, moreover, only rejoice that, for appreciable reasons of historical and symbolic continuity with the original Treaties of 1957, it has been agreed that the final signing of the Constitutional Treaty is to take place in Rome. We are honoured by this prospect and will do everything possible to ensure that the Member States' representatives are welcomed in a manner worthy of the occasion and, of course, of our traditions of hospitality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, constitutional reform is certainly a top priority for the future of European integration, but the Union must also be able to meet its citizens' legitimate day-to-day expectations. Europe must increasingly live up to its role of creating economic growth and prosperity. Here, we are on solid ground: the euro is an element of stability for the economies of the Member States which have chosen to support monetary union, and the Lisbon Strategy mapped out a process of convergence to increase European competitiveness. However, we cannot overlook the persistent flaws of our economic structures, evidence of which lies in the lower-than-forecast growth rates.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the annual operating programme presented jointly with the Greek Presidency at the beginning of 2003, the Italian Presidency has set out a number of specific initiatives. The modernisation of agriculture, environmental protection, consumer protection and food safety are essential requirements for our citizens; in these areas Italy will steer work towards the goals identified by earlier Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore confine myself here and now to three points which we feel are crucial for Europe's competitiveness. The first point is the need to provide more effective support for the economy by increasing public and private investment with the cooperation of the European financial institutions, especially the EIB. We consider that such a strategy should be based especially on boosting the policy of major Trans-European infrastructure networks. If the internal market is to work efficiently in the enlarged Union, it will require greater mobility of goods and services and a more efficient transport network. The need here is to square the legitimate requirements of monetary stability and financial rigour – which must not be called into question in any way – with the need to stimulate economic growth more powerfully through investment in research and technological innovation as well as infrastructure, for we firmly believe that the European economy's most important resource is its human capital.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is discussion of the sustainability of the European pension and welfare systems. Intergenerational solidarity and the adaptation of existing schemes to the reality of a progressively ageing society are challenges that we can no longer shy away from. Bearing in mind that situations differ from Member State to Member State, we must investigate policies to increase the level of employment among older workers and to reduce the trend towards early retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third and last point is the need to modernise the labour markets and promote entrepreneurship, particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. In this field, too, the opportunities offered by the great internal market which is being extended to include the ten new Members will elude the EU Member States unless they adopt a coordinated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategies can be implemented through dialogue between the social partners. Indeed, the European model is based on a market economy which seeks to strike a balance between free enterprise and the claims of cohesion and solidarity. In this connection, there can be no neglecting that more vulnerable, silent section of Europe's population, whom legislative inertia all too often prevents from taking a leading role but whose civil and moral contribution remains invaluable. I am referring to the 38 million European citizens with disabilities. The European Union has proclaimed 2003 the 'European Year of People with Disabilities'. In addition to the awareness-raising and information events and campaigns already organised, the Italian Presidency will endeavour to lay the foundations for legislative action to combat discrimination, for an instrument to protect people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life and give them a future of hope.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union also contributes to international stability, and its responsibility in this respect starts at its immediate borders and depends on its capacity to be open to increasingly advanced forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries. In this case too, the Italian Presidency intends to carry on the work of previous presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">During the current period between the signing and the entry into force of the Accession Treaties, we shall seek to ensure that the 10 new Member States participate fully in the work of the Council, making it easier for them to be fully integrated into the Union's institutional mechanisms. At the same time, we shall attempt to establish by<span class="bold"> </span>December a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania which paves the way for the accession of both countries by<span class="bold"> </span>2007. We shall continue the pre-accession strategy <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> Turkey on the basis of the conditions established at the Copenhagen European Council last December. We know that the decision on the date for opening negotiations will not be taken until the end of next year, but, with this in mind, we consider it all the more advisable that the Union should actively support the reform process already initiated by the current Turkish Government. We shall continue to emphasise the European prospects of the countries of the Western Balkans, in line with the Zagreb Process. The agenda we agreed upon at Thessaloniki represents a further step forward. In retrospect, analysing the European Union's role in the Balkans, we can be proud of ourselves. If we compare the current situation to the situation 10 years ago, we can see that intervention by Europe and the United States made it possible to bring to an end the bloody conflicts of the former Yugoslavia, the last major European civil war, and we hope that this will also prove to be the last time that European blood is shed on European soil.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is now time to move on from the present phase of association and stabilisation agreements to a more integrated strategy, with a view to strengthening our relationship with the countries of the region. We are aware of the complexity of this approach, but we also know that Europe is offering the only prospects able to provide the governments of those countries with an effective incentive to proceeding without delay along the path of reform, modernisation, the free market and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency sees the invitation from the Commission, supported by the Member States, to encourage increasingly close relations with the areas closest to us to bring about what we have labelled 'Wider Europe', in a very positive light. We shall therefore seek to strengthen our relations with Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. We shall likewise seek to consolidate relations with the Russian Federation particularly strongly through increasingly close dialogue and specific measures that are tangible confirmation of Russia's desire to belong to the political, economic, social and cultural fabric of Europe and the West.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the focus on Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism should now be mirrored by equal interest in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue; this dialogue is crucial for relations between the West and the Islamic world, an issue we feel to be as important today as Eastern Europe has been in the past. Our aim is to establish a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, already launched by the Barcelona Conference. The economic and social development of the southern area of the Mediterranean is essential to world stability, in view of the culture, politics and demographics of the southern Mediterranean. The integration of Europe's economy with that of the Arab countries is a major challenge of our time and is the key to peace and security in this area and in Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore cultivate the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, to which we shall devote a large number of economic, cultural and social initiatives – including a Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations – and we shall cultivate the project to transform the financial facility currently operating within the EIB into an autonomous body, in other words a genuine Mediterranean Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the decisions adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conferences in Valencia and Crete and approved by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Italian Presidency endorses the wish expressed by the European Parliament and the national Parliaments to see a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly established during this Presidency as a mark of a constant commitment to dialogue between Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean seaboard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, establishing conditions for international security is now a key task for the countries which share a set of universal values based on freedom, democracy and peace. This is the main area in which fundamental transatlantic relations and the partnership between Europe and the United States must now be reinvigorated. We wish to confirm our conviction that there is no incompatibility between a strong European undertaking and equally strong transatlantic solidarity. Mindful of this, we will strive to restore depth and dynamism to the relationship between the Union and the United States, which are also vital if Europe is to have greater authority on the world stage. The establishment of a solid, balanced transatlantic relationship also depends on a substantial European undertaking in the field of defence, in line with the NATO framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and support for the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are specific areas in which to test our ability to build a solid relationship of cooperation between the two shores of the Atlantic. We are thinking in this particular instance of the need to establish a democratic civil fabric in the reconstruction of Iraq and support for the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Middle East, we are quite aware that the situation is extremely complex. Our Presidency, together with the United States, the Russian Federation and the United Nations, will work in support of the roadmap towards the establishment of time limits and procedures for launching an international peace conference. My country has offered to hold the conference in Sicily. There are at least two lines of action that we intend to promote: firstly, restoring a relationship of greater trust with Israel with a view to broader and more structured mutual cooperation, and, secondly, implementing the plan – already launched by Italy at European Councils and G8 Summits – for rebuilding the Palestinian economy, which could act as a tangible, effective incentive in negotiations between the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of brevity, I cannot list all the Union's responsibilities on the world stage, but I feel bound to mention the economic, cultural, civil and, I would venture, spiritual ties that link Europe with Latin America, a region currently experiencing a period of change which Europe hopes will generate freedom and justice. The Latin American States have asked us to open up our trade frontiers. The success of Latin America is that of the other America, linked to Europe in a different but no less significant fashion than North America.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say that we shall work to strengthen our existing ties with Africa, to which we are bound through its unhappy history, with Asia, with the regional organisations and with the United Nations system to move forward together on the great challenges of the fight against poverty and disease, environmental protection and conflict prevention. We will also focus on the balanced development of international trade as a source of greater well-being and reduction of inequalities – the subject of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Cancun next September.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe want democratic, transparent institutions, a prosperous economy and a free society, but also an area of freedom and security. At Tampere, Seville and, most recently, at Thessaloniki, the European Council recognised the need to enhance Europe's capacity to combat transnational organised crime, illegal immigration and related trafficking, through more effective controls at the Union's external borders. We will endeavour to work on these points, focusing on the mobilisation of adequate financial resources, the gradual implementation of a common readmission policy and the integrated management of external borders. Above all, however, we will emphasise the need to include illegal immigration issues in relations between the Union and the countries of origin and transit of migration flows. We must introduce effective forms of cooperation with some of our neighbours, especially in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, in the field of control and management of migration flows. Our legitimate request for more effective cooperation from these countries in endeavours to prevent illegal immigration will be matched by willingness on our part to integrate citizens of third countries legally resident on Union territory. As well as continuing legislative work on asylum and visas, we consider it a priority to improve the operation of all the Union's operating mechanisms for combating crime, starting with the strengthening of Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear from my remarks just how sensitive and complex the challenges facing the European Union are, challenges to which our Presidency will endeavour to help find a solution in the limited time available, in a spirit of humility and service and in the full, firm knowledge that the security and prosperity of our future will depend increasingly on the process of European integration which has guaranteed us peace, freedom, security and well-being for half a century now. The Europe of today is no longer the airy kite capable of playing the winds of history that it was at the time of the Treaty of Rome. Our Union has become much stouter and is weighed down with responsibilities and duties towards its partners and the rest of the world. My hope is that, during the Italian Presidency and looking onwards to the Irish Presidency, we shall succeed, with the cooperation of all those involved and with the particular help of the new Member States, in restoring to our institutional giant something of its lightness and its original energy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic"></span></span><span class="italic"> (IT)</span> President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Presidency is beginning at a critical point in the life of the Union. It has the tough but exhilarating task of carrying through the revision of the Union’s founding Treaties and delivering the first European Constitution. Indeed, the six months of the Italian Presidency will see the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will work on the basis – the ‘good basis’ to quote the Thessaloniki Conclusions – of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention. The Convention is Europe’s first experience of a constitution-building process. We should therefore not underestimate the impact of the word ‘Constitution’ on our European life, which has made it possible to achieve results that appeared quite unattainable a while ago. The Charter of Fundamental Rights will be enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty. The Union will have a single legal personality: this considerably strengthens its international status. Defining the powers of the Union will allow the citizens to distinguish more clearly between the competences of the Union and those of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have never pretended, however, that I was happy that certain reforms I consider indispensable – and which many have called for – have been tackled too timidly or not at all. In September when<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>Intergovernmental Conference<span class="bold"> </span>opens, the Commission will accordingly be putting the key issues still unresolved on the negotiating table with its opinion. Qualified-majority voting has been extended to many areas but not enough to meet the needs of an enlarged Union: there are other areas where unanimity should no longer be required. The Union can hardly function effectively if decision-making calls for unanimity among 25 Member States: it would be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed arrangements for the make-up of the Commission do not reconcile the need for representativeness and the need for efficiency. A permanent presidency<span class="bold"> </span>of the European Council is likely to bring overlapping and conflicts with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro, one of the Union’s greatest political achievements – maybe the greatest – is still not represented effectively and coherently on the international stage. Clauses also need to be inserted on amending the Constitution by an enhanced majority. I cannot see how the Constitution can be adapted to the Union’s new requirements without a procedure for amendments based on majority voting. No reform is possible on the basis of unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a more democratic and efficient institutional framework, which should come out of the Intergovernmental Conference, is vital, not least for an economic and social policy and a foreign policy with more clout. The Commission has the political will, the arguments and, if I may say so, the enthusiasm to press these points home forcefully.</p>
<p class="contents">President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the other major challenge of the next six months is to press ahead with the building of ‘Greater Europe’ and to implement the new neighbourhood strategy. As we push on with enlargement, we also need to fully implement the pre-accession strategy for the candidate countries. The Commission is working actively on this. The aim is for this process to work well to the benefit of our fellow citizens and the Member States, both current and acceding. With the momentum provided by the Thessaloniki Council we can also continue to forge an ever-closer partnership with the Balkans, without which this phase of the enlargement process can never be considered to be complete.</p>
<p class="contents">At Thessaloniki, we agreed on an agenda to take the Balkan countries to full membership of the Union. I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union’s priorities. I am pleased that the strategy I proposed, the development of a ring of friendly countries, is starting to produce the anticipated results, and I welcome the unanimous support of the Heads of State and Government for this long-term European Union policy. In this context, it is vital that we move on to the practical phase of the new neighbourhood strategy without delay, with specific action plans and new systems of assistance. We are preparing a number of proposals along these lines for Parliament and the Council to consider and develop. In particular, as regards the Mediterranean region, I hope the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue will be in place by the end of the year. As you said, President-in-office, the European Union made an invaluable contribution to the drafting of<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>roadmap, alongside the United States, Russia and the United Nations, and it must also play a key role in its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to pay close attention to transatlantic relations. The recent EU-US Summit in Washington marked an important milestone in our relations with the United States. Quite apart from the matters discussed – and the discussions proved to be amongst our meatiest in recent years – the most important aspect was the firm determination displayed on both sides to reestablish a climate of cooperation and solidarity. I am not saying there are no differences in our viewpoints and approaches to particular issues, but even where this is so, the strength of our relationship cannot be called into question. As I said at the Summit, our goals are the same, even if we seek at times to achieve them in quite different ways. Perhaps the clearest example of this fact is the relationship between the United States and the European Union in the field of international trade. Both sides want fewer barriers and better access to markets, fairer trade and clearer rules that are also appropriately tuned to encouraging the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On some of these topics our practical approaches are different, but this does not stop us having a close, ongoing relationship that allows us to work round our differences, nor does it stop us working together to achieve a positive outcome in the multilateral talks within the World Trade Organisation. I want to make this quite clear, for all this is possible because the Union speaks and negotiates with a single voice in trade matters. It makes it a powerful, influential partner, which it is most certainly not in areas where competence is divided and fragmentary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the toughest challenge we face is to restore the conditions for vigorous, balanced, enduring economic growth in the Union. The situation is difficult: economic growth has slowed down significantly, although I do not believe there is any reason to speak of deflation. At the same time, we must tackle the reform of Europe’s social security system too. Competition from our trading partners and the ageing of our population make such reforms extremely urgent. However, before us there is also a great, unique opportunity: an integrated Single Market of almost half a billion people. I do not think we have realised what a powerful tool we have for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that we give practical thought to instruments for strengthening coordination of the Union’s economic and fiscal policies, so that we can tackle the difficulties together and exploit together the enormous advantages the Union offers. The Commission is aware of how serious these challenges are and, in recent months, it has proposed two initiatives, which the European Council strongly supported. Firstly, we proposed – and our proposal was taken up – to utilise all the flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact so each country can adapt its fiscal policy to its own economic situation, without losing sight of the stability objectives and without overshooting the 3% limit laid down in the Pact. As I have said on a number of occasions, this was necessary but not sufficient. We need to move towards a period of closer coordination, and tax policies in the Member States – particularly those with the highest public debts – need to become more sustainable in the long term. Secondly, at the Brussels European Council last March, I raised the issue on behalf of the Commission of the need to give fresh impetus to completing the infrastructure necessary for European development and for supporting research, increasing spending to reach our target of 3% of the Union’s GDP, as, moreover, is provided for in the goals we ourselves set at Lisbon. At the same European Council, I voiced my concern that investment in research in the Member States has actually, without a doubt, declined compared with last year, while Europe’s major firms are transferring a growing proportion of their research outside Europe. Hundreds of thousands of our brightest talents are leaving Europe to work – and stay all their lives, unlike the Asians, who return home – in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission has decided to react. In conjunction with the European Investment Bank, it is finalising an initiative to help to increase overall investment and private-sector participation in two key areas – trans-European networks and research and development projects – with a view to achieving the Lisbon targets. We want to mobilise and coordinate all the Union’s current sources of funding and explore possible alternatives, without jeopardising Member States’ budget stability. The Commission is pleased to note that the Italian Government has recently expressed its firm support for this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to speed up the approval of proposals prepared by the Greek Presidency but not yet approved. Approval of these measures in the course of the Italian Presidency will help to improve the Union’s economic and social outlook. In particular, the proposed legislation concerns the following fields: temporary-employment agency work, take-over bids, measures in the wake of the ‘Prestige’ disaster, security of gas and electricity supplies, the second rail services liberalisation package, environmental liability rules, implementation of the 10-year action plan for people with disabilities, due to be presented by the Commission during the Italian Presidency, public procurement rules, the creation of the Single European Sky, the extremely important, impatiently-awaited directive on traceability of GMOs, the finalisation of the Directive on the European Patent, harmonisation of asylum procedures, the status of refugees, and, lastly, the<span class="bold"> </span>Agreement with the ESA on the development of the European Space policy. I am confident that, with the help of the Italian Presidency and with your own help, President-in-Office, we will be able to adopt speedily the practical decisions needed to achieve these goals. Economic recovery is not just about reform: it also calls for confidence that proposals can be put into effect quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main challenges we must meet in the coming months. We are about to lay the foundations of a completely new Europe, and these foundations are political and economic, not just constitutional. The Commission is working to preserve and consolidate a strong and prosperous Europe that is also just and inclusive. The greatness of the European project lies precisely in its capacity to foster and extend peace, democracy, justice, prosperity and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility to launch a wide-ranging internal debate on the post-2006 Financial Perspective. In the autumn, we will be presenting our political project for the enlarged and reformed European Union for discussion at the December European Council under the Italian Presidency. The forthcoming Financial Perspective represents a crucial stage in the European project. By 2007, the Union will have a new constitutional framework, in all likelihood 27 Members and a population of almost 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crucial time in the Union’s history. A time that calls for unity and a strong commitment to cooperation among all the Community institutions and between the institutions and the governments of the Member States. I am confident that we will find the right solutions to the great issues facing Europe today. This calls for vision and conviction. For vision, because we really are laying the foundations for the Europe of decades to come, and we cannot accept short-term solutions that merely respond to the – albeit difficult – current economic climate. For conviction, because Europe is not just one of several options, one of a number of different alternatives. Europe is the only way forward: without Europe, our countries and societies will be irreversibly relegated to a marginal role.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy has been there since the start of the European integration project and has always played an extremely important role. Think of the Treaty of Rome, think of the preparation of the Single European Act, think, on a more general note, of the enthusiasm and conviction with which Italy has helped to achieve the major goals of European integration, starting right here in this House with great Parliamentarians such as Altiero Spinelli and Emilio Colombo. We are all confident that Italy will continue unhesitatingly along that path.</p>

I hope that will be indicative of the success of the Italian Presidency that we all expect and hope for. I would like to make a request to everyone, no matter what side of the House you are on, that certain debates taking place in all the Member States of the European Union should not be escalated to European level, and in that way prevent us from achieving our objectives at that level. We must now achieve the great and ambitious objectives before us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me spell this out clearly: my group will be monitoring the Italian Presidency objectively, fairly and in a spirit of constructive criticism, just as it does with every presidency. Sometimes people have no sense of symbolism. However, I am very aware of all the competent people representing Italy not just here in Parliament, but also in the European Council and on the Commission: you yourself, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Fini, who has represented you in the Convention and played an important part in its work, Mr Frattini, Italy's Foreign Minister, Mr Buttiglione, Italy's Minister for Europe, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and last but not least the Italian Commissioner Mario Monti.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased that your own comments and those of the Commission President were in agreement. Just at the moment we cannot help thinking about 25 March 1957, when the Rome Treaties were signed on the Capitol in Rome. You now have the fantastic task – some might see it as a burden, but it really is a splendid opportunity – of making your own contribution by means of specific actions, so that at the end of this year we will be able to say that we have the European Constitution of Rome, which will then be signed in Rome, on the Capitol perhaps, by when the ten new countries from central and southern Europe, that is Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus and their citizens will belong to the European Union. What a great moment in history! I do not know if I should offer your Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, my condolences or congratulations on the fact that in the coming weeks and months he will have the enormous task, reporting to you, Mr President-in-Office, of carrying out the practical work needed to achieve that goal. Let me reassure the Italian Presidency and all our friends in Italy that my group will do its utmost to ensure that this will be a great success and that we will be able to achieve a European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I would specifically like to thank you for repeating here today – and I think that this involved a departure from your written text – what you said last week in Rome to the Conference of Presidents. You said that you would ensure that, when Heads of State and Government meet, then our own President will of course also be present, and that representatives of the European Parliament will also be present when the foreign ministers meet to discuss the constitution. I would like to thank you for that assurance, but we will be watching to make sure that this actually happens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat the sincere thanks I addressed yesterday to our representatives in the Praesidium of the Convention, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and Klaus Hänsch, for the excellent work they have done. My thanks to them also go to all the Members of this House who have participated in the Convention, including the chairman of our group in the Convention, Elmar Brok. We trust that, with Parliament’s support, it will now be possible to achieve a result by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you talked about strong European institutions. Yesterday, in the presence of the President of the Italian Parliament, Ferdinando Casini, of Helmut Kohl, Honorary Citizen of Europe, of the French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and of many others, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of our group, and it was made clear once again that we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stand for a Community of Europe, because we know that a return to mere cooperation between governments would be a step backwards. That is why Europe's institutions need to be strong, and in the final analysis that must be the outcome of the debate on the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We know at the same time that we Europeans have our roots in our home countries, in our own regions, and that our European citizenship flows from our nationalities and the countries from which we come. A strong European Union does not therefore conflict with our home countries – it complements them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately I do not have as much speaking time as the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to limit myself to just one more point. Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned infrastructure projects. We will be looking at that very carefully. But we will also be asking ourselves this question: will the stability of the euro, which also needs to be represented abroad – and I particularly agree with you about that, Mr Prodi – be undermined by this? We do not want that to happen. We want to defend a strong euro and the stability of our new European currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to say, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that we wish both you personally and your much-loved country, Italy, a resounding success. We also and above all wish that success for the sake of the European Union. I am delighted that my Socialist friends agree – if you can continue along those lines we will be able to talk about a shared success. If we can achieve that, it will for evermore be written in our history books that on 16 April 2003, 10 countries in Central and Southern Europe signed the accession treaties, and we will then have a European Constitution, signed in Rome, with effect from 1 May 2004. I wish you every success with that, and my group will continue to follow you along that path in a spirit of constructive criticism.</p>

<p class="contents">I am going to speak to him frankly on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: we want Italy and its Presidency to present a <span class="italic">bella figura</span>, which succeeds, rather than a <span class="italic">brutta figura</span>, which fails. What worries us is that, when we hear President Ciampi talk about Europe, we feel more reassured, but when we hear President Berlusconi talk about Europe we feel more concerned. Today you have taken the Ciampi line. The problem is when you tell us that the Commission must be abolished and that Russia and Israel must join the European Union tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that the Convention has produced a historic result. If you will allow me, Mr President, I will remind you of the first sentence of the preamble of the Constitution produced by the Convention, which was written 2 500 years ago and is still relevant – it is our fundamental creed – and it is a quotation from Thucydides: ‘Our Constitution ... is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the greatest number’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This means that we are obliged to make laws for the general interest and not to resolve specific cases involving a minority. That is the cornerstone of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Convention and the Constitution, I have taken good note of the fact that you have expressed a will to negotiate. I would like to say that we, who would improve the text of the Convention, believe that there must only be formulations of a technical nature, in other words, negotiation over outstanding problems, and that the Constitution must not be rewritten and, in particular, not be moved backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">You have made a proposal on the participation of Parliament. I am grateful for this, but I would like to say one thing to you: this is what we have had since the Treaty of Amsterdam, and even since the Treaty of Maastricht, that the President can attend European Councils and the conclaves, that we have representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference – we call them observers, but we want representatives. Now there is something else, however. The Convention has taken place. The doors cannot be closed. What we are also asking – and I hope that Parliament will approve this in its resolution – is that the Presidency should be obliged to provide information regularly, here and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Giorgio Napolitano, and that we should be able to invite, as we do, representatives from national parliaments. Yesterday we spoke about this with President Casini and we agree, because what we cannot do is return to diplomacy behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also talked about the European economy. I was surprised that you did not refer to the Lisbon strategy, because what you have talked about is largely the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. But in relation to the so-called ‘Tremonti’ proposal, which is a resurrection of the Delors plan and the van Miert proposal, it is good to hear from conservative politicians and conservative governments that a degree of Keynesianism is acceptable, because we have been asking for this plan for ten years. Well, let us see how we can do so, how you will apply the ‘golden rule’…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">…how guarantees will be established ... even you, who are a successful businessman, could begin by making a first subscription to the bridge of Messina which would overcome the division between Scylla and Charybdis, which has been fundamental to European history over the last 3 000 years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of intergenerational solidarity and the future of the welfare state, it is true that we must talk about pensions. I do not believe that you are proposing that Social Security and pensions should become a European competence – that would go further than what we are saying – but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future, above all in relation to immigration. There was recently a debate on this issue in your government, moreover, between hardliners and advocates of a more intelligent, human policy. We believe that Thessaloniki has been a very important step.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to another constitutional issue, which concerns us because it was a resolution approved by the whole of this House, including the votes from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: at the end of last year we expressed the need to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in relation to freedom of expression and, specifically, in relation to the media at European level, in order to counteract the growing disparity between the national anti-concentration rules and in order to guarantee the rights of the citizens. This is a Green Paper which was produced by the Commission ten years ago and has yet to bear fruit. We believe it is important – given the prospect of an enlarged Europe and in the interests of guaranteeing these fundamental rights – that we work on this. I would also point out, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this does not bear any relation to an issue we faced when you were a Member of Parliament: the issue of the waiving of immunity in relation to a case in my country. What we are proposing is the development of a constitutional right for all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I will refer to foreign policy. If you continue the work of the Greek Presidency with regard to transatlantic relations, we would consider that to be positive and we also believe that an important role can be played through the Quartet in the Middle East. I would ask you to act like Mrs Rice, that is, when you go to the Middle East, not to talk only to the Israelis. She has had no problem talking to everybody. Why should an important European have such a problem? I very much appreciate what you have said in relation to Latin America, which is also a transatlantic issue, and above all in relation to Mercosur.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by thanking you for your generosity and by talking about Italians: when the Treaty of Rome ‘II’ is signed at the Campidoglio, I am sure that my group colleague and Mayor of Rome, Mr Veltroni, will be very happy to receive the Italian President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you, Mr Berlusconi, that we will not be partisan and we will judge your Presidency on the facts, on what you can do, and not just on promises.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   –<span class="bold"> </span>Mr President-in-Office, until last night your programme was available only on your website and only in Italian and it is still now available only in Italian and English. While I have the good fortune to use a computer and to read both languages, some colleagues do not. I hope this is not a presage.</p>
<p class="contents">Your primary task will be to convene the IGC to examine the draft Constitution. My group shares your ambition to finish this work as soon as possible, and in good time before next year's elections. We trust that you will provide adequate representation of the European and national parliaments whose involvement in the Convention helped make it such a success. But the future of Europe is up to the Member States. If they continue to fight over it, it will be not a Treaty of Rome – not even a Treaty of Dublin – but perhaps a Treaty of Utrecht, representing peace through exhaustion.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats agree with your priorities on the European economy. Our economy is in a bad way; the German motor of European growth is stalling. So initiatives to revive growth are welcome. Yet the completion of the trans-European transport networks must be viewed as a means to an economic end – the smoother functioning of the internal market – and not as an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As a British Liberal, I am delighted by the fidelity of your programme to John Maynard Keynes, and my delight is matched only by my surprise. However, I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States' commitments under the Stability Pact, which is already under great strain.</p>
<p class="contents">For Liberals the continuing value of Keynes lies in his insistence on solidarity. Your programme speaks much of consumers, but we are citizens first and foremost. Market ideology tricks people into equating buying power with voting power, and it robs us of the civic freedom by which we control the social consequences of our private choices. Where regulation is needed is where the gains from remedying market failure for citizens or the environment outweigh the costs of government intervention. In Italian political debate this is the difference between <span class="italic">liberalismo</span>, in which we believe, and <span class="italic">liberismo</span>, which we very much reject.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the closer cooperation you propose with countries around the new borders of the EU, but we should not offer false hope of membership to our neighbours. Closer relations with the Union must be linked to democracy, respect for human rights and development of a market economy. We particularly welcome your emphasis on the Euro-Med partnership, which has long been a Liberal priority, and your plans for Albania, where Italy can surely show a lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Your programme's proposals on transatlantic relations, which are on the mend after the breakdown caused by the crisis over Iraq, and your aim to rebuild ties with America are welcome. However, while seeking common ground with the United States, we must not shy from speaking up for Europe's interests where we disagree, and we welcome the strength of your statement on the International Criminal Court</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East too, the Union must project its voice in the Quartet strongly and clearly. Assistance in rebuilding the Palestinian economy must be conditional on action against terrorism, as improved cooperation with Israel must be conditional on progress in implementing the road map, notably on dismantling settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">On agriculture and on immigration, Liberal Democrats find much less in common with your priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">These two policy areas are linked. You say very little in your programme about CAP reform and yet at present every cow in Europe gets a subsidy of EUR 2 a day, while one billion of our fellow citizens worldwide must survive on less than EUR 1 a day. Unless we open our markets to farm produce from developing countries, their people will vote with their feet. The policies you propose on justice and home affairs seek mainly to prevent immigration. They will not work because you cannot beat the law of supply and demand which operates in labour markets like elsewhere. When you tell us you are concerned about Europe's reputation '<span class="italic">Cercheremo di fare bella figura per l'Europa', lei ha detto</span>, please bear in mind that white Caucasians are in a minority on our planet. We hope that you will be guided in justice and home affairs by the balanced approach of the Greek Presidency, rather than by the tenor of Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, your country assumes the presidency following a highly successful Hellenic Presidency, marked by the search for compromise and agreement. Liberal Democrats in this House hope that in your tenure in the Chair you will, in your words and actions, respect the dignity of the office and honour Italy's traditional European vocation.</p>

We love the Italy of the great popular demonstrations demanding employment, social justice and equality; of the vigorous anti-war movement; of the socially aware demonstrations in Genoa against social and police violence; and of the European Social Forum in Florence. It is an Italy that is young, demanding, enthusiastic and combative because it is convinced, as emphasised by its main watchword, that another Europe is possible and because it is determined to bring it about.</p>
<p class="contents">This other Europe is one which provides itself with the resources to loosen the grip of neo-liberal globalisation in order to make employment, training, retirement and social welfare more secure for its citizens, to guarantee proper public services and to improve the standard of living – in short, to place people’s lives above the demands of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">This other Europe is one founded upon ethics and equality before the law, one that banishes elitism and exclusion, prohibits privileges and submission and eradicates the poison of intolerance, racism and xenophobia from within our societies, as well as from Europe’s relations with the rest of the world. This other Europe is one emancipated from US tutelage and daring to make another voice heard in the great international institutions in order, together with its allies from the South, to tackle the open wounds that make the planet less and less safe and habitable and that go under the names of poverty, underdevelopment, environmental disaster and war.</p>
<p class="contents">Like ourselves, this fine, unbiddable Italy does not identify with current European Union trends. With all the more reason, it is disgusted by the policies of those in government in Rome who are carrying European trends to the point of absurdity. Their neo-liberalism is unrestrained, their Atlanticism unconditional and their taste for democracy rather half-hearted. One of the priorities of this Presidency is a mammoth project to develop infrastructure. This would warrant careful examination on a case-by-case basis, for blatant needs do, in fact, exist, like that for a ‘piggyback programme’ on a scale appropriate to the EU. Relying upon private capital to carry out such work that will only be profitable in the very long term is, however, to head towards certain failure in the areas of employment, growth and quality of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of this Presidency’s priorities is to force the pace at which advantages in terms of pensions and social welfare are dismantled. This is the trademark of the most conservative forces. As for the plans relating to immigration and the right of asylum, which need to be finalised in the course of the next six months, revulsion is the only possible response to the idea that this ultra-sensitive debate might be sullied by the barbarous cries of rage to which one of the personalities in the current coalition is frequently given.</p>
<p class="contents">We finally learned yesterday that formal decisions will have to be taken between now and December concerning the EU’s new strategic doctrine which, when outlined before the start of the Italian Presidency, had already elicited great fears. Therefore, extreme vigilance will be required in all respects throughout these six months. If the current constitutional process is to have any meaning, let us begin by ensuring compliance with Article 2 of the draft Constitution, devoted to the values of the EU and worded as follows: ‘The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are common to the Member States in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity, and non-discrimination’.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, as we know, Europe is a continent of widely differing peoples and cultures, but one thing is certain: there is nothing surprising in the concern which has greeted your arrival at the helm of the Union. Italy is tainted with a stain which could well spread to the rest of the new Union: an extraordinary concentration of power, primarily economic and media power but also political power, which has placed you in a position, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, where you are now above the law. However, we realise that just continually protesting will not suffice: we prefer to act. During these six months too, we will continue to urge the Commission to respect its undertaking to present a communication on the degree of pluralism of the media in the Union and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties. Indeed, we feel that Italy is rather hesitant, so to speak, when it comes to enforcing the ‘Television without Frontiers’ directive. We have fought to have pluralism included among the founding values of the new European Constitution, so that the lack of a legal basis can no longer be used as an excuse not to take action in Europe regarding media concentration and pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of economic crisis, it is usual to endeavour to find ways of boosting the economy. We know that Italy has extremely creative ministers who are anxious to expound their ambitious plans for bridges, tunnels and motorways at European level. We are ready to enter into constructive dialogue on TENs and the role of the EIB, but we must be under no illusion. It is not true that only three of the 14 projects decided on at Essen were executed because of a lack of funds: if there were not enough investors, one reason is that the appropriateness, socio-economic viability and – we would add –environmental sustainability of many of those projects were not guaranteed. We must recapture the spirit of the Delors plan and two powerful principles contained in the Commission’s White Paper on Transport Policy, which I am afraid we sometimes all appear to disregard: investments must serve not just to fill Europe with infrastructure but to promote economic and social cohesion too. We must banish the idea that economic growth must of necessity go hand in hand with transport growth, for, otherwise, we will soon find ourselves stuck in a permanent traffic jam. It makes no sense to spend EUR 6 billion on the Messina bridge to shorten journeys by half an hour when thousands of Sicilians are without drinking water and it takes three hours to complete a 100-km journey by train. It makes no sense to invest 15 years of work in a 54-km tunnel for the Turin-Lyons link, drilling a hole through a mountain full of asbestos, when modernising and enhancing the present line would make it possible to absorb twice as much freight traffic in five years. We do not want to discuss grandiose projects which may not be achievable – we want investment which promotes innovation, renewable energies and land regeneration with regard to which the participation and acceptance of the citizens living in the areas concerned are seen as an asset rather than an annoying obstacle.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, your European programme states clearly in black and white that we must open a new season and that we must combat environmental bureaucracies. This is an interesting circumlocution, which we believe refers to the desire to extend to Europe a principle which is in great vogue in Italy – total deregulation. We will oppose this attempt to export Italian produce, which is particularly risky at the time of enlargement, for it directly serves the policy of making everything subservient to infrastructure and is based on an antiquated concept of the environment as a commodity to be used and sold off.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy is second only to Spain when it comes to breaches of environment legislation. Your government, President-in-Office, has changed the laws on waste so as to make monitoring more difficult, even though 11 million tonnes of waste are lost without trace and the turnover of the ecomafia is estimated to be around EUR 2.5 billion every year in Italy. It has weakened the laws on the assessment of environmental impact so much that it has become purely a formality. It has consented to the indiscriminate promotion of hunting in parks by regional authorities. For this year, it has appropriated EUR 56 million for protected areas, which is less than the cost of building 1 km of motorway tunnel. It is preparing to decriminalise environmental offences across the board. In all this, it is disregarding Community law. In this matter too, as in the issue of the media, we feel that this is a situation specific to Italy. President Prodi, in a sector in which the Union has genuine competences and international responsibilities, we fear that the unnecessarily complicated infringement procedure is no longer sufficient, and that by maintaining an excessively tolerant attitude and giving more consideration to the details of form than to substance we are in serious danger of helping to render Community legislation on the environment completely ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, as regards foreign policy, we would all like to benefit from your excellent relations with President Bush, but certainly not to organise an impossible contest in military expenditure, maybe reducing contributions to development cooperation organisations in order to fund the Italian presence in Iraq. A fundamental dispute has arisen with the Bush administration over the International Criminal Court. We would like to know, President-in-Office, whether you are going to press ahead with and update the action plan for the Court, which was adopted in May 2002. Then you are on excellent terms with President Putin. Once again, it is our genuine hope that we will all be able to benefit from this friendship. You have listed all the countries in the world: how can you forget Chechnya? We need incisive action to bring about resolution of this conflict. We must adopt an initiative, and we will support you if you do so, with a view to convening a regional conference for the Caucasus in which all the current conflicts can be addressed without fail. Moreover, President-in-Office, we believe that we and you would be proud if you succeeded in persuading President Putin to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word on the European Constitution. We will support the Italian Presidency’s endeavours to achieve a short Intergovernmental Conference so as not to disperse the – moreover, few – positive results of the Convention. However, President-in-Office, you must keep nuclear energy out of the Constitution, and I call upon the deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fini, to help us keep it out. Just as for GMOs, it would be unwise to underestimate the negative reaction of the citizens of many European countries, Italy included, when faced with the explicit promotion of such a costly, dangerous source of energy, as is currently contained in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Muscardini (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, a constantly-changing society demands from politics new debates, the ability to take rapid decisions and, above all, the willingness to reflect deeply, with full knowledge of the facts, on the geopolitical and different economic and cultural situations which, in some respects, contribute to the ever-widening gap between north and south and between citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Convention, I would like to express my satisfaction and the satisfaction of the Group which I have the honour of representing in that forum – the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations – with a text which recognises the value of the national States in the new European Union: a Union which we hope will have stronger and more transparent institutions after the Intergovernmental Conference, which can prove to the world that the European Union exists as a model of civilisation and development. A civilisation which wants to see its values recognised without wishing to abuse the values of other cultures; development which must be compatible with the rate of adaptation of man. It is our hope that, with regard to the preamble, the Intergovernmental Conference will come to an agreement on the acknowledgement of the roots from which the Union has sprung to life. The ancient history of Greece and Rome, the Judaeo-Christian traditions and the secular, liberal values which came gradually to be established cannot be disregarded because it is from them that the future of Europe is drawing cultural and moral strength. We can see, moreover, that it would be appropriate to reflect once again on the need for there to be a European Commissioner for each Member State, in order to achieve greater cohesion between all the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitutional Treaty will, at last, give rise to a politically cohesive, free, independent Europe which respects the languages and traditions of each nation. The Italian Presidency has some extremely arduous tasks ahead of it and we are confident that, in the spirit of cooperation that it will foster with the other European institutions, with the Members of the European Parliament, the elected representatives of the people, it will give fresh impetus to the process of unifying Europe and to Europe’s role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency of the migration issue demands an overall view. As I had occasion to write on the eve of the Thessaloniki Summit, only Europe, not least through a new Mediterranean policy and, at last, adopting a new principle of cooperation with the poorest countries, will be able to stop illegal migration of biblical proportions becoming a collective tragedy. I look forward to the European border police corps and the new agreements with third countries, I look forward to reinforced cooperation in combating organised crime, terrorism and fundamentalism, but the issue of a European approach to the globalisation of the markets must be addressed too, to prevent cultures and traditions becoming fragmented and dying out.</p>
<p class="contents">A healthy social market economy cannot continue to accommodate unrestrained financial speculation such as that we have witnessed in recent years, which has broken out intermittently without there being any attempt to destroy its roots, to eradicate its causes. The health of the economy also depends on the parameters governing our actions, and one good parameter is that the financial economy must move at the same rate as the real economy. Europe cannot disregard the fact that the mobility necessary to allow the economy to develop further is dependent on two requirements: cultural education, which provides young people of all nations with the basis for mutual understanding – which means the national governments will have to address the need to provide more and better information on the activities of the European institutions – and the question of accommodation, which cannot be the responsibility solely of individuals or the private sector but to which the institutions too must help to find a solution; likewise, infrastructure- and transport-related issues need solutions at both national and European level, and so we would point out again here the need for rapid completion of Corridor 5 and Corridor 8.</p>
<p class="contents">To combat the new forms of poverty which are emerging increasingly in the countries of the Union, we feel that it is vital for Europe to have a stronger energy policy which, based on seeking new sources and more efficient use of known sources, goes hand in hand with preserving those environmental values without which the very life of the planet would be endangered. At the same time, the issue of funding for research must be addressed: without substantial increases European research will not reach a level of excellence, with all the predictable ensuing consequences. In this connection, a more effective European food safety policy becomes particularly important in order to safeguard the quality of products and to protect their origins, thus safeguarding the citizens’ health, which is the Union’s main asset.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe is called upon not just to uphold the right to life of its citizens and of all human beings but to send out the message that all people have the right to a dignified life. Indeed, in the third millennium, all the most highly developed communities are, in any case, being called upon to take the political, cultural and economic measures necessary both within and outside their states to ensure that the tragedies we are witnessing do not continue. Children in Afghanistan currently have the lowest life expectancy in the world. Like millions of other children – in Africa, South America and the Middle and Far East – they are deprived of the right to life and the right to a dignified life. The relentless combating of terrorism and the consolidation of peace are dependent, not least, upon Europe’s ability to deliver what it has promised over the course of recent years: the right to a dignified life, Mr President, not least in order to put an end to practices involving physical mutilation, to which many women are subjected in their countries of origin, suffering this abuse in Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations also expects from the Italian Presidency policies seeking to combat forms of discrimination, to crack down on traffickers of arms and human beings and to destroy the arcane, yet powerful world of child abuse. These criminal organisations have unrestricted, unregulated use of the Internet, which they use to spread their evil culture throughout the world. We therefore call for the drawing up of rules to stop a tool which exists to facilitate communication between citizens being transformed into a tool for use by those who violate the laws of the national states of the Union. In order to stop this happening, every technological invention must be subject to a European screening process, a scientific experimental control process which provides the guarantee that it is safe to use.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if freedom is to be true freedom, there have to be rules: a small number of clear, enforced rules. We appeal to these rules in the hope that the Italian Presidency will enjoy today the good will and cooperation of the European Parliament, the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations and of all 25 countries which make up our great Europe.</p>

A serious constitution cannot be devised as quickly as that. When the EU is equipped with common citizenship, fundamental rights and a whole charter of rights that can be invoked directly before the courts, the character of the whole cooperative enterprise is altered, and every single provision of Title III is to be read in a new light and can acquire new significance.</p>
<p class="contents">To cite just one example: when the Treaty of Maastricht introduced common citizenship, it was expressly stated in writing that citizenship had no direct effect. The judgments of the Court of Justice nonetheless caused citizenship to be of direct effect, and people are now free to settle anywhere in the EU and have their rights further extended by means of the many fundamental principles in Title I of the Constitution and Title II of the Charter. The people and the elected representatives should be aware of all the consequences of the Constitution before it is adopted. This will require a large number of working parties, opportunities to table amendments and transparent democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What would the Constitution mean, for example, for the Danish summer house protocol? Denmark prohibits Germans from purchasing summer houses in the way that Danes can. This quite clearly contravenes the ban on national discrimination under Article 4 and the principle of equality under Article 44. Can two such fundamental principles be set aside by an exemption, in the form of a protocol, to the rules governing the free movement of capital? Is there a hierarchical relationship between the fundamental principles and the other provisions in the Constitution and protocols? Alternatively, take Article 51, which protects the structure of the churches. Denmark can in this way retain a Protestant state church, but can Article 51 also lift the ban on religious discrimination in Article 2, paragraph 21 of Title II? Is the Danish constitution lawful or unlawful? It would be nice to know the answer before the Constitution is signed. Article 12(2) renders the majority of all the international agreements unlawful, for the EU would be given not only shared competence but also sole competence to enter into any agreement if only an internal act were affected. Ought it not at least to be stated in writing that all existing agreements shall continue in force until such time as they are altered?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pannella (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a practical look at what is already happening. We must measure in this way, with intellectual honesty and, I believe, this form of cooperation, any difference between what is said and what is done. On 7 June, Mr Berlusconi, in Jerusalem, you said, and I quote: ‘In the future, Europe must include Israel. We look on Israel as a European nation to all intents and purposes: cultural, economic and political’, going on to describe it as the Middle East’s only true democracy. I repeat: ‘In the future, Europe must include Israel. We look on Israel as a European nation to all intents and purposes.’ This is the official wording of the written document we have. ‘In this context,’ (the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership) – and I quote – ‘we shall not neglect the need to consolidate relations with Israel with the prospect of more extensive and structured reciprocal cooperation’. This is the line taken by those who oppose Israel’s entry into the European Union, for, clearly, those who are opposed do not say ‘We don’t want these dirty Jews’; they say ‘Cooperation is enough’. We support Mr Berlusconi who, at that time, was not yet President-in-Office of our Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as regards Turkey, we have always heard Russia, Turkey and Israel specified. Here, too, your text explicitly denies the goal of Turkey’s accession. What does it say? ‘The Italian Presidency furthermore considers it essential to inject more specific content into relations with the Russian Federation’ and so on. This is quite clear. As regards Turkey, ‘… we are engaged in jointly monitoring its path to integration, encouraging the Government in Ankara to continue its efforts in the fundamental process of internal reforms.’ And that is supposed to herald its accession! It is true that Mr Buttiglione has said in recent days that Turkey is a military regime which can never become part of the European Union, but without the soldiers it becomes a theocracy. This is Christian Europe! I would just like to say one thing very briefly, and we must admit<span class="bold"> </span>it. It is not true that there is a history of Europe – just one: there are many. There is the history of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation, there is the history of a Europe which produced victorious communisms and victorious fascisms and nazisms, which produced, and still produces today, antidemocracy. Then there is the other history, the history condemned, I regret to say, by our Polish Pope when he condemns liberalism. By the way, it is <span class="italic">liberalismo</span>, Mr Watson, not <span class="italic">liberismo</span>: here we have had liberalism for a century. There is a Europe of the Pontifical Zuaves – European and French Zuaves – fighting the Italian <span class="italic">risorgimento. </span>There is a Europe which is the Europe opposed to our Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Ernesto Rossi, of the Europe, Mr Berlusconi, which you heralded at the G8 in a way which I applauded. We Radicals applauded! We want to take Europe closer to the World Democracy Organisation and focus actively on the Community of Democracies. We applauded at the G8! Today, of course, Mr Watson was quick to stress the Keynesian nature of your speech, but I have always maintained that, culturally, there is essentially great similarity between you and President Prodi when it comes to the political choices you make. Giulio Tremonti talks of ‘Colbertism’ rather than ‘Keynesianism’, but when all is said and done …</p>
<p class="contents">There are just two things we have to ask from you, then. Firstly that, at the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union includes or brings about the inclusion, as Mr Fini announced, of the question of the moratorium on the death penalty. Secondly that, starting with the UN events, the Democratic Caucus representatives should be convened by the Presidency of the European Union. If you comply with these two requests then we will be more than content. As far as the rest is concerned, I wish you and us all luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those few have now become the vast majority. This excellent result – which your government, Mr President-in-Office, so strongly desired – marks the beginning of a presidency packed with more undertakings and more hopes than any other in recent years. Italy, a founding country, was given a mandate by the countries of the Union at Thessaloniki to carry the work of the Convention through to its conclusion. That is not all. Europe has chosen Rome to be the venue for the signing of the first Constitution: this is a political result of great significance, an historic act of recognition for Italy and for its freely elected government. This recognition will encourage and support it in its work over the coming months, Mr President-in-Office – work which I am certain will enable us to achieve the objectives you have set out in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The text we approved at the conclusion of the Convention’s work certainly leaves room for improvement but, as you said, it represents a fundamental working basis that cannot be misinterpreted. Your programme, which we in the European People’s Party endorse, is mapping out for tomorrow a reunified Europe, which is an ally of the United States but is capable of shouldering responsibilities that until now it has been unable to take on. In defining a balanced system of Council, Commission and Parliament – we in this House acknowledge, Mr President-in-Office, that you have underlined the importance of the role that the European Parliament plays and will continue to play in the IGC – and in designating a President of the Council and a Minister for Foreign Affairs, the new Treaty will provide an answer to the question ‘Where is Mr Europe?’, which anyone looking for clear interlocutors in our continent might ask.</p>
<p class="contents">The demise of the principle of unanimity is the other option that will enable us to overcome obstacles that have all too often blocked European initiatives. Let us hope, therefore, that the Intergovernmental Conference will increase the number of subjects which can be decided upon by majority voting. The Constitution is, however, merely an instrument: its provisions cannot produce an effect if the political will is lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, your speech clearly showed Italy’s decision to give great weight to the Union’s actions abroad. If we so desire, Europe – with its attention turned towards the east and also the south – can play a leading role in promoting peace, progress, security, development and social justice, not least for the weak and those with disabilities, as you mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">A Constitution and political will alone, however, are not enough to make reality the project of the likes of Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet, Gaetano Martino and Altiero Spinelli. Europe will not succeed if it cannot speak to the hearts of its citizens. Europe will be the Europe of values: it is in values that our origins are rooted. I hope that the IGC will want to include an explicit reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the preamble to the secular Constitution of our Europe because, if we lose sight of our origins, we shall not succeed in treading new paths or looking towards those new horizons that tomorrow’s Europe must reach.</p>

It is on these that we shall assess the work of your presidency. The concerns that have surrounded it, however, are not all due to prejudice. The unresolved conflict of interests remains a legitimate source of concern that extends well beyond our own country. In addition, the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ruggiero, had a significant effect on the way people understand Italy’s role in Europe, the same Europe that Minister Bossi dubbed <span class="italic">‘Forcolandia’</span> [‘Gallowsland’] because it is repressive, and which he has today branded a neo-Jacobin project, intrinsically authoritarian and globalising. Perhaps this accounts for your coolness towards working seriously on the construction of a European area of justice, freedom and security, starting with the European arrest warrant, which ought to be approved by December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Major problems, I was saying: the Constitution, first of all. We ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference should not put the Convention’s results forward for further discussion and that Italy should make every effort to improve the text on essential points, such as the extension of majority voting. On economic questions, we see that the Italian Presidency intends to relaunch the idea of public investment for infrastructure. We shall also add training, research and the environment. This proposal can only make headway if it adopts a truly European perspective, if it is firmly anchored in the Community method and is financially viable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pensions, you are well aware, Mr President-in-Office, that Europe has no competence in the field of social security schemes, which are so diverse and so closely tied in with welfare policies. Does the Presidency really mean to promote a European initiative in the economic and social field? Well, then, it should do its best to have taxation and social policies brought within the Community’s competence in the new Treaty, based on the guidelines of real European control of the economy, as this Parliament has been demanding for some time. In these matters, however, the method of consulting the social partners has to be followed, as laid down in the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards immigration, one cannot invoke just one piece of European policy – the part relating to frontier controls to combat illegal immigration – and ignore all the others, on the management of the influx and the reception and rights of those who, by coming here to seek work, contribute to the economic growth of our countries, those, let us be clear, whom your Minister for Reforms lumps together as ‘Bingo Bongos’.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the matter of foreign policy, it is possible to be both Europeans and friends of the USA. Friendship, however, is a relationship that must not fall into subservience. After the difficult Iraqi crisis, it is therefore even more urgent to define a sound common foreign and security policy, backed by overthrowing the right of veto. A clear framework for the Union’s foreign relations was drawn up at Thessaloniki, distinguishing further prospects of enlargement from closer relations with our neighbours; in this context, after the contradictory statements that you and your Minister for European Policies have made regarding Turkey, we hope that what you told us this morning will stand. Similarly, for the Middle East, we hope that the peace process will be supported by the Italian Presidency, but to reach this goal it will be necessary to talk to and take into consideration all the parties involved. I wish you success in your work, Mr President-in-Office!</p>

In the next six months Europe must start moving faster; the constitutional treaty for a Europe of 25 should make the world realise whether our continent will continue to be a driving force for economic and social progress and, after the serious Iraqi crisis, whether it will equip itself with effective means to take a leading role in matters of security and freedom in partnership with the United States, in a new multilateral cooperation. As a European, therefore, I hope for a successful Italian Presidency working in close collaboration with the Commission under Romano Prodi and with our Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President-in-Office, you have been cautious and made an effort to present your programme along lines of collaboration with the other countries and not in discontinuity with Italy’s traditional policy for Europe. We need to be bolder, however, if we do not want our compromises to slip away, especially as regards control of the economy, foreign policy and the necessary new defence policy, so as to minimise the risk of paralysis due to the need for unanimity. Over these six months we expect a radical change that can remove the reasons for all the criticism, scepticism and concern that have surrounded these first few days of the period with you at the helm. Indeed, it is not the internal politics of one country but all Europe that is calling for an end to conflicts of interest and media concentrations. It is the liberal fundamentals of the separation of powers and the balance among the powers as reflected in the European Treaties which we have freely signed and by which we are bound. The spirit of Rome of the 1957 Treaty was based on a daring vision of the future, and it constructed fifty years of democracy, prosperity and peace. If we are guided by that vision, even from alternative political positions, we shall harvest common fruits for the good of Europe and its future.</p>

I think there is a rhetoric surrounding the six-month presidency of a nation, which cannot hide the political reality: the reality is that every presidency is the presidency of a government, not of a country; therefore, if people are against the Bush Administration it does not mean they are anti-American, and if people in Italy and Europe are against their government, it does not mean they are against Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is, of course, an important episode; it is a challenge that has quite rightly been called historic. We are afraid that your government will aggravate rather than favour the necessary choices. You are starting with a handicap: in Italy the country’s consensus is split, a major part of European public opinion is contrary (and I believe the causes lie precisely in your politics), the bases for the economic crisis in the country have been distorted, as it has been under severe strain with the conflict of interests and the conflict between the established powers. I personally feel the worst damage has been done by a minister in your government who can speak of the need to open fire on convoys of immigrants at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not, however, protest about your government’s presidency; we shall confine ourselves instead to criticising your politics, the bases of which are essentially the primacy of the United States of America and the primacy of the market. Both are factors of potential crisis for Europe: one, the United States, driven today by a doctrine of pre-emptive war; the other, the market, faced by a clearly developing crisis of social cohesion. You, Mr President-in-Office, have put forward a proposal for a transatlantic, neo-liberal, post-democratic Europe. We think this proposal goes against the vocation and historic mission of Europe today, of a Europe that needs another perspective. Someone spoke of a Keynesian policy; I beg to differ: large-scale infrastructure is not a Keynesian policy; it may instead be a threat to the environment through deregulation, and it also runs the risk of not being completed because of the difficulties in financing it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another side to your politics, however, which is neo-liberal through and through: it is what we call job insecurity and you call flexibility; it is what is shown – as, indeed, in other European countries – in the attack on the social security system. This, Mr President-in-Office, is not Europe. The real Europe is the one calling for independence from US policies for the sake of a different political culture, the one calling for a different social model. Your strongpoint today is the weakness of political Europe, because the truth is that this political Europe is founded on a democratic deficit, and because I think that the Convention, too, is ambiguous and weak, a far cry from the great progressive constitutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we shall not oppose you for the sake of this Europe, but for the sake of another Europe: a social and democratic Europe. That is why our hope is – and please do not take this as a sign of hostility – that mass movement action in Europe will grow in both numbers of participants and importance during the Italian Presidency. There is just one thing on which we should like to be able to come together with you: in calling loudly for a moratorium on the death penalty. That, at least, would be a good sign of civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You spoke about Italy's proud contribution to peace and international law, and we would ask you whether your presidency will feature as a milestone in this respect. How, for example, would you deal with the pressure which the United States is currently putting on Serbia not to sign the Treaty on the International Criminal Court, while at the same time Europe wants to offer the Balkan countries the prospect of accession to the EU? The refugees who wash up on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea are an indictment of the inhumanity of our system. It will never work without legal immigration options.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke, above all, about monitoring procedures and about sending people back, but sustainable development and peace in the countries from which people come must become a priority in the immediate future. This development requires not only trade measures, but also respect for the environment and development opportunities for those countries. They are now being robbed of everything and people are given weapons instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace in the regions in Europe is also important. There are regions in every accession country that are waiting for opportunities and for sustainable development, because they are faced with impoverishment and depopulation. This is also the case in some of our own regions. We would ask for greater visibility of the regions in the Constitution. Constitutional regions, in particular, wish to receive respect instead of supercilious treatment from the Member States that have the final say in every instance. This only adds to the frustration in the constitutional regions. I hope that your presidency will demonstrate an understanding of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work the Convention has done is good work: the initial basis is sound, it may be that only a few adjustments will be necessary, such as a better definition of the balance of legislative powers between Europe, between the Union and the individual states. As for the problem of majority voting or unanimity in decision-making, we have to reconcile two needs: the need for efficiency and the need to respect the sovereignty and interests of the states that make up the Union. In your speech, you repeated the word ‘negotiation’ several times. I think some effort to reconcile different needs is also required in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to mention something which I do not think it will be possible to achieve but which I must highlight: the need for a reduction in the Commission’s monopoly on legislative initiatives to the benefit of this House. Parliament does not have the right to initiate legislation – the only case in the world, I believe. Even a mere town councillor can table proposals, but Members of the European Parliament do not have this right. I believe this question at least deserves your attention. I too offer you my best wishes for your Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope that throughout these six months, at all times in fact, we will be able to distinguish between domestic ideological differences and the institutional responsibilities such as those which the great country of Italy is now taking on. We take note, in this regard, of the commitment of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">The main task of the Italian Government is to successfully organise the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and to employ all its capacity for dialogue in order to bring the positions of the Member States together. In this regard, we are grateful for the commitment of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. The objective is for the IGC, in any event, to begin and end in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">Time periods here, Mr President, are very important so that the countries which decide to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution of Rome, allowing it to coincide with the European elections on 13 June 2004 – and I wish that were all of them – are able to do so. In this regard, Mr President, please allow me to take this opportunity to urge the political opposition in my country to agree to a reform by consensus of the rules governing the referendum so that such a vote may be possible, as we all wish.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like during this six-month period for strong impetus to be given to the negotiations for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and we call on the Presidency to do everything possible so that these negotiations may end within the time period of the current European legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the European Union’s internal policy, we fully support taking further steps on the Lisbon strategy and continuing to make progress on the area of freedom, security and justice, particularly in combating illegal immigration, and in terms of the foreign policy of the Italian Presidency we hope that it relaunches the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in Naples and we welcome its commitments in this respect on the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, but in particular the relaunching of the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">And we would also urge you to promote progress in the negotiations with Mercosur which the WTO will promote and which your Italo-Argentinian compatriots will no doubt welcome.</p>

There has been fierce criticism not only in the left-wing media, but also, to a great extent, in the conservative media. This is not, however, something that we Social Democrats take any pleasure in, because we neither want nor are able to replace Italy's internal opposition. In the interests of Europe, we wish the Italian Government a successful presidency; there is too much at stake to do anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem lies, Mr Berlusconi, in the fact that we have heard so many contradictions from Italy in recent months. Let us take foreign policy, for instance. In your speech today, Mr Berlusconi, you talked about how Europe must be an active protagonist on the world stage, and about how we also need diplomatic and military instruments. You also talked about the need for a strong partnership between Europe and the United States. You are absolutely right on all three counts!</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that in recent months we have seen you, Mr Berlusconi, as a Prime Minister who has not nurtured partnership with the United States, but one who has practised servility and blind obedience. We have witnessed a Prime Minister Berlusconi who was very reticent about creating a military arm for Europe. What is more, Mr Berlusconi, I hope that you will adopt a more balanced position on the Middle East, and that you will emphatically call on both sides to refrain from resorting to violence. We need to combat terrorism in the Middle East just as forcefully as we need to demand the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the dismantling of the wall that cruelly divides Palestine in two.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the important issue of economic and financial policy, the statements made by the Italian Presidency so far have once again been contradictory. The investment programme proposed by you and by Mr Tremonti for infrastructure projects and for research and development is a good idea as such. But it is not yet clear whether it is just a question of weakening budgetary discipline or whether Italy is seeking support from Europe for projects it finds hard to finance. In this case too I call on you to display more clarity and openness if we are to jointly implement the approach of the Delors White Paper and the Commission's proposals. I have in mind in particular the proposals the Commission adopted when Karel Van Miert was in the chair. If you can achieve that, Mr President-in-Office, if you can bring forward a coherent and precise proposal, you will also have the support of the Social Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, every presidency runs the risk of confusing national and European interests. The public has unfortunately gained the impression in recent months that in your case personal and political interests are also involved. It would be dangerous for an EU presidency if personal, national and European interests were all mixed together …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and I hope that you will do your utmost during your presidency to make it crystal clear that you are not speaking as an Italian Prime Minister with a political axe to grind, but as the President of the Council of the European Union. If you do that, even if we may follow your progress with a critical eye, we will nevertheless support you in your work.</p>

I feel embarrassed at all the criticism, censure, sarcasm and derision levelled at my country for what has, I regret to say, quite rightly been called the Italian anomaly, or the serious conflict of interests that involves our Prime Minister. I also feel humiliated, because I recognise indeed that, whenever our Prime Minister expresses an idea, illustrates a proposal or presents a measure on the economy, finance, information or especially justice, we never know whether in doing so he is thinking of our interests or his own and those of his friends. Or rather, we in Italy know only too well, unfortunately, given what he has done up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried because I do not want the conflict of interests virus that is humiliating Italian democracy to spread to a European level, because this is the real cancer for democracy, Mr Berlusconi, not the work of the judges, as you foolishly stated the other day. I am, however, also proud – yes, proud – because, thank God, Italy’s institutions are not just made up of the Prime Minister and the friends he has brought in with him, especially in the Italian Parliament. That is why I am sure that Italy’s leadership of the European Union will, as a whole, with the involvement and collaboration of all the institutions, including the oppositions, rise to the occasion despite the Italian anomaly, which I am glad to say is transient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is our hope and also our commitment but, frankly, it is bad for Italy and for Europe that the person who is to represent us during the coming six months is Silvio Berlusconi. The whole of Europe knows that he represents an anomaly unparalleled elsewhere in the world. An immense weight hangs over him and his actions because of the ongoing conflict between his own personal interests and those of the people of Italy and Europe as a whole. He is the richest man in Italy: his immense economic power and his private affairs, which are present in every field of activity, conflict with the laws, the standards and the very principles of the State; they conflict with justice, and that is the truth. It is very sad for Italy and for Europe to have to read fierce criticism of him in the most respected newspapers in every country. You have all read it, ladies and gentlemen, so I will not repeat it: it is harsh criticism, but it is true.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of us it is a cause of the greatest concern to see someone at the head of the Council who, during the war in Iraq, acted not to unite Europe but to divide it, by coming out against the feelings expressed by the vast majority of the people of Europe and once again adopting subservient positions towards the United States; someone who on international issues departs from the prevailing European line, on relations with Israel and Palestine, for instance, or the dramatic immigration question; someone who, on economic and social issues, starting with the attack on pensions, has espoused an extremely <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> and deeply anti-popular line.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi is the right, and the worst, most dangerous kind of European right, and I therefore have no illusions. Frankly, I expect the Berlusconi term of office will prove to be a total disaster. I hope at least that, in the interests of Europe and my homeland of Italy, the damage can be kept to a minimum. Let this be quite clear: for this reason we shall act decisively out of a pure sense of national responsibility and a staunch European spirit. For this very reason, we shall oppose him and his politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not because of Italy, of course, the foundation of our culture, of many of our languages and of the very idea of Europe, but because of the political personality of President Berlusconi.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Mr Berlusconi, are one of the main representatives of the authoritarian right of our day, protagonist in the battle between the classes, internally and globally, between the rich and the poor and the workers. You even call people such as President Prodi, critical journalists and the judges who judge you ‘communists’. You use antiquated language, even troglodyte language, forgetting which century you are in. You are a friend of Sharon against Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents">This distrust was ratified by certain key elements in your speech today. You subordinate the constitution of the European Union to relations with the United States. You are unaware of the chaotic and tragic situation in Iraq, caused by governments friendly to you. You forget the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, which was suffered principally by my nation, Galicia. You underplayed the constant deaths of immigrants, off both our coasts and in your island of Sicily. You said nothing about the social Europe, about social and territorial cohesion, not even in view of the prospect of enlargement. You did not expressly defend the draft constitution.</p>

The peoples of Europe do not want this and demonstrated as much during the war in Iraq. Nor is it the option favoured by the European institutions. Following the example of Parliament, commitment to a multilateral world under the aegis of the United Nations rather than that of the United States has been expressed by the Commission in the shape of Commissioner Patten and Mr Prodi – the former hardly a dangerous left-winger, the latter perhaps a little more in that vein – and even by the Council, or at least to all appearances.</p>
<p class="contents">What Europeans are waiting for is the affirmation of their own European identity. Public opinion has come into its own on this matter, Mr Berlusconi. Do not disappoint it. What, indeed, would be the use of this would-be constitution which, whether it be a source of delight or indignation, is a considerable leap forward in the direction of European sovereignty, if our continent were to end up becoming the handmaiden of the US empire? Mr President, given that this treaty is to be signed in Rome at the beginning of May 2004, I hope you will be very keen to propose to your colleagues in the Intergovernmental Conference that the peoples of Europe, as sole wielders of sovereignty and, therefore, as those who alone are in a position to relinquish such sovereignty, should vote on this Constitution in a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Ministerial Conference of the ‘World Commercial Organisation’ – a name I think is more apposite than World Trade Organisation – will be held in Cancun during your Presidency. In the same spirit, I do not want this meeting to be the opportunity for our old Europe, to which we are ultimately rather attached, to sacrifice its cultures, its ways of life and its Community on the altar of unrestrained free trade. Already, our agriculture has been more or less remodelled in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. I fear that our cultures, our identities and our specific character, which has, moreover, given birth to world civilisations, might suffer the same fate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly thinking of Mr Louis Michel, Foreign Affairs Minister, and Mr Elio di Rupo, the chairman of the Walloon <span class="italic">Parti Socialiste</span>.

Recently the debate over the structure, the powers and the institutions of the European Union has come to dominate almost every European discussion. It therefore comes as a breath of fresh air to see that you have put the pursuit of the Lisbon strategy at the forefront of your policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to face up to the challenges of economic change and reform. At a time when Europe is facing deflation and stagnation, it is encouraging to see that you recognise the need to revive the process of major liberalisation of European economies. We need real action on the Lisbon strategy rather than empty rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">The millions of unemployed throughout Europe want sustainable jobs, rather than our apparent obsession with institutional design and architecture. Jobs and prosperity will have a more direct and real impact on the lives of the people that we are here to represent than tinkering with EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning then to the IGC and the prospective new constitutional treaty, I urge you and your fellow Heads of State to return to the objectives that were set out in Laeken. You were amongst the European leaders who called for the Convention to bring the EU closer to the citizens. Some of us seriously question whether the outcome really achieves that. The European governments should have that Laeken statement firmly in their minds when they begin the negotiations in the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political élites have always assumed that the only way that Europe can succeed is by regular, institutional change. But our enlarged Europe of 25 states should be a place where proper respect for the diversity of nation states is upheld and defended. Imposing a straitjacket of uniformity can only damage the true interests of unity in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I also applaud the statement that you made in your priority objectives, in which you say your desire to complete the work of the IGC is dictated by respect for the values of democracy and transparency. We trust that you will keep to this in the intergovernmental negotiations that lie ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to clarify a matter I raised in Parliament with President Cox yesterday. The accession countries will be affected by the outcome of the IGC in the same way as the current 15 EU states. I note that they will participate in the IGC on an equal footing with current Member States. President Cox repeated that statement to me yesterday after my speech. But what does it really mean in practice? Surely it should mean that the accession countries have a full and equal right to vote in the Council on the outcome of the IGC? Perhaps you can confirm whether that is also your understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome your clear commitment to revive and reinvigorate the transatlantic relationship. Recent events have damaged the strong ties that exist between Europe and the USA. In a newspaper yesterday, you said that the West must be united. There cannot be competition between us and America. Given the growing strains between America and some countries in recent times, we are looking to you to take this priority forward as a high priority. We must ensure that the European Union in the defence field does not pursue objectives that lead to antagonism with the institutions of the NATO Alliance.</p>

But there is one person he forgot, and that is Mr Bossi. He is also a member of the Italian Government, and the least utterance from this man is far worse than anything that inspired this House to censure Austria and oppose the Freedom Party's inclusion in the Austrian Government. We ought to talk about him as well!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I realise that you are not responsible for your ministers' IQs, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but you are responsible for what they say. The comments made by Mr Bossi, your Minister for Immigration Policy, which you mentioned in your speech, are totally incompatible with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. As President-in-Office of the Council, it falls to you to defend those values, so I call on you to defend those values against your own minister!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on a point made here by Mr Di Pietro. He said that we should not allow conflict of interest to infect Europe. Yes, he is quite right, and we have now found ourselves in a difficult situation for some days in this House whenever we talk about the Italian Presidency, because we keep being told, ‘now you must be careful not to criticise Berlusconi because of what he is doing in Italy, because the European Parliament is not the right place for that’. Why should that be? Is Italy not a member of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course the European Parliament is the right place, and I shall tell you why. The members of Italy's Parliament are elected to concern themselves with your actions as the Prime Minister of Italy, and we are elected to debate what you do as President of the European Council; that is our responsibility. You talked about the area of freedom, security and justice, and about the Tampere process. You used a single term, Europol, but you did not use those three terms. I wanted to remind you about that and ask if you could say a few words about those three concepts. What do you intend to do to speed up the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's office?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What do you intend to do to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant? What are you planning to do about the mutual recognition of documents in cross-border criminal proceedings? I think you could do with a little reform in your own country when it comes to the authenticity of documents. If you were to implement that reform in your own country, the European arrest warrant could then come into force much more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am delighted that you are with us today and that I can have this debate with you. We owe that not least to Mrs Nicole Fontaine, because if she had not made such a good job of dragging out the Berlusconi and Dell'Utri immunity procedures – Mr Dell'Utri being your right-hand man, who by way of exception is here today for once – if she had not done that, you would no longer have the immunity that you need. That is another truth that needs to be spoken here today!</p>

<p class="contents">Rebuilding a real partnership with the United States must start with a direct relationship with the European Union, with Europe gradually taking on responsibility and leadership in NATO, with a moderate, rather than antagonistic or subservient view of the relations. Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we believe it is essential to encourage the United Kingdom to join monetary union so as to strengthen Europe at an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The other difficult test lying ahead of you is the solution to the Middle East problem, bearing in mind that the roadmap requires a highly impartial attitude, and therefore European intervention must not be directed to just one side. These are major challenges, Mr President-in-Office, for which, on behalf of myself and also our country, I wish you every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore sure – and the facts will confirm this – that your commitment to respond to the expectations of your European citizens every single day will mark out your Presidency. The rule in our speeches is to try to make a contribution to the reports. There is a great difficulty here, Mr President-in-Office, because the subjects dealt with have covered all our expectations. There is just one point to which I should like to call your attention: during the six months of the Italian Presidency the new rules on cohesion policies will be drawn up. In this context, I think the Italian Presidency should remind the European Union of a number of specific responsibilities, which are: to strengthen economic and social cohesion; to reduce the disparity in the development levels of many regions, which is still present in our Union and will be even more accentuated with enlargement; and to implement ideas of geographical solidarity, and in this respect we are thinking of the remoter regions. This is based especially on three principles: that without resources the cohesion policy will be difficult to implement; that the sectoral policies that the Union is developing – just think of the effects of the reform of the agricultural policy – should contribute to a great ideal of European cohesion; and that the new idea of European cohesion should also include the flexibility criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, which my colleague Mr Tajani has already touched upon: all these policies will come together in the work of the IGC, confirming the Convention. Well, I believe a reference to the founding values of Europe, an explicit reference to Christian values, would be a contribution to our history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have been a Member of this House for 14 years. In that time, every six months, I get mounds of documents from the incoming presidency telling me about its priorities – but not this time. I have had nothing. Yesterday I went to the presidency website – it was the first day of the presidency – to see what its priorities were, and there was a sign saying that nothing would be available until 16.30 hours. So I thought 'ah, the secrecy is because there is going to be some big announcement'. I waited with bated breath. But what we got was the usual warm words.</p>
<p class="contents">This suggests to me that the real reason for this delay and the lack of information is simply because this presidency is not ready. That is what concerns me. When Europe is faced by some of its greatest challenges, such as how to prepare for next year's enlargement, we have a presidency that appears to have been so distracted by internal affairs that it has not properly prepared for its presidency. I wonder whether this is the worst-prepared presidency of my time in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned by a lack of consistency. I will not repeat what Mr Swoboda said, although I agree with it. However, today we have heard of the presidency's enthusiasm for developing European defence. I note that this is the very government that rejected the A-400 M, which is, after all, the key element in European defence capability. That makes me wonder just how many of these warm words will be turned into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned by contradictory statements within the government about migration. We have had some very emotive speeches on this subject. Quite frankly, we cannot run the important issue of asylum and immigration on knee-jerk rhetoric that only upsets and fuels the anxieties of our population. We have to show political leadership and a balanced approach, both in looking at the integration of migrants – something that the European Parliament will look at for the first time during this presidency – as well as the management of migration based on our economic needs and the needs of migrants themselves. I hope the presidency will show exactly that political leadership on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That will not happen in this House. Your work will, however, be scrutinised carefully, for there is no immunity in this House against political blunders and infringements. This autumn, the EU is to unite around an asylum and immigration policy based upon humanitarianism and shared humanity. That is something you did not say very much about in your speech, Mr Berlusconi. Success demands clear leadership that can act with legitimacy and authority. I must unfortunately ask myself the question as to whether the Italian Government really is capable of shouldering that responsibility today. One of your own ministers, mentioned earlier in this House, demands that the police use live ammunition upon refugees seeking freedom in your country. That is something you must now clearly reject.</p>
<p class="contents">Your own role as Italian media proprietor has led to the government directing the content of both the private press and of public television. That is a very worrying development that affects the whole of the EU and that would not have been accepted if it had happened in any of the EU’s new Member States. The gloomy question we now have to ask ourselves is whether Italy is a country that fulfils the political Copenhagen criteria. May you demonstrate that we critics and sceptics are wrong. I nonetheless wish you good luck over the next six months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that you will be able to combine political will and the spirit of conciliation in order to take European integration one stage further.</p>
<p class="contents">In international affairs, transatlantic relations are obviously fundamental. The European Union’s discussions with the United States, along the lines of those held recently in Washington, must become more regular. Issues such as environmental protection that are the subjects of conflict between the two sides of the Atlantic, should be approached on a more pragmatic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the opinion of the Italian Presidency on the need for a short IGC, examining, if possible as it stands, the draft constitution of the European Convention and, above all, not re-opening the Pandora’s box of national requests. We are on the verge of adopting a common constitution drawn up in the full light of day. May we succeed in seizing this unique opportunity, and let us get ready for the new constitutional Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to the enlargement of the EU, people need to feel safe within the borders of an EU alert to the external threats represented by illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism. From now on, we need to show the determination required to achieve the desires of the Thessaloniki Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At an economic level, the Italian Presidency’s plan to give new impetus to the trans-European network of road, rail and sea transport, as well as to the research and development project, is a necessity. As the French Prime Minister, Mr Raffarin, pointed out, the pact that links Europeans to one another is called the Stability and Growth Pact. We are therefore in favour of the European Union taking initiatives in the area of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As representative of the overseas regions, I would emphasise the importance, in terms of the EU’s social cohesion, of doing everything possible to open up the regions far from the centre of Europe. European solidarity depends on such efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only encourage the new Presidency, in the run-up to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003, to develop its relations, particularly in the field of trade, agriculture, infrastructures and migration, in order to ensure that the Barcelona process does not run out of steam.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would keenly encourage any European or national policy designed to promote linguistic diversity. A Europe rich in 20 languages and as many cultures must not be reduced to a Europe of just one language. That requires effort on the part of everyone, however, and we await practical initiatives in this area from the new Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said – and I imagine you will have realised the fact in the course of this debate – we shall judge you by your actions and not by mere words. You will also be aware that Parliament has high ambitions for a successful IGC, and it is the task of your presidency to bring it about. That is the ambition of Parliament and of my political group, in the service of a European democracy that operates at all levels, be it at European level or in each of our Member States, a democracy that respects this Charter of Fundamental Rights that we have just incorporated into the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just, very belatedly, come across your programme in English – I do not, unfortunately, read Italian – and I see that there is again talk of Jacques Delors’s White Paper. I am delighted, because I think Jacques Delors was right. Since he proposed that the EU undertake this grand project of trans-border networks and European infrastructures, we are, quite simply, coming up against the same problem, namely that of funding. You raise the idea of funding by the EIB, but the EIB is still just a bank. You will find no solution other than a European loan. Are you prepared, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to fight for a European loan to fund this major work? Otherwise, it will be a case of just words, words, words. At the end of the day, does this reinvigoration plan serve the cause of European growth or simply that of the Italian economy as it struggles to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Constitution will be an historic development recalling the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Parliament, however, expects a step forward on the majority vote and a common foreign policy, which it believes is the only alternative to American unilateralism and the most worthwhile basis for Euro-Atlantic understanding. I also hope there will be some thought about the fact that human values, which are clearly expressed in the clauses of the Constitution and are there to protect the European citizenry, have Christian roots. Christianity is no restriction to the secularity of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency has the opportunity to incorporate the trans-European networks – which the Commission’s priority projects have marked out as an objective for strengthening European territorial cohesion – into a broader programme. We must, however, allocate more resources to the research and innovation policy, as you, Mr Berlusconi, have said and Mr Prodi has confirmed, since the competitiveness of the European economy depends especially on this investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This Presidency should, finally, put into practice the initiative outlined at Thessaloniki for an immigration policy that finds a steady balance between legality and reception; that is, one that upholds the values we read of in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to reinvigorate Europe’s Mediterranean policy, we must be aware that no initiative involving the southern Mediterranean countries can be successful unless it is based on a strong peace policy that guarantees the security of Israel but also a homeland for the Palestinians.

In fact, the Italian Government seems to be practising a <span class="italic">gelato caldo</span>, or ‘hot ice’, strategy. It talks in riddles. The Stability and Growth Pact should thus become both stronger and more flexible at the same time. There is talk of a ‘Maastricht of pensions’, a slogan that, at first sight, is devoid of meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">President Berlusconi has just invited us to reflect upon the durability of European social welfare. The Group of the Party of European Socialists is fully aware of the problems at present posed by the contract between the generations. The fortunate increase in life expectancy, together with shorter working lives, have led to a decrease in the number of people actively employed, as compared with the number of retired people. That obviously presents a problem of funding for the public systems operating on a distribution basis. It may be seen, however, how private pension funds operating on a capitalisation basis experience similar problems. In the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, pension funds are accumulating losses and experiencing serious liquidity problems. Everywhere, companies are converting the basis of their pensions funds from one of defined benefits to one of defined contributions. In other words, employees know what they have to pay but are no longer aware of the money to which they will be entitled once they have reached retirement age. Does not this ‘Maastricht of pensions’ conceal a desire to reduce the public commitment where pensions are concerned? The Presidency must clarify its real intentions in this matter as quickly as possible. The PSE Group will not, at any event, accept a pensions Waterloo.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals by the minister, Mr Tremonti, in favour of trans-European transport systems comply with a political priority defended by my group for years. As the concept is not very clear and as the funding is by no means assured, it is difficult, however, to see what might be the impact upon the European economic situation of bringing about future trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Ciampi said – and I shall conclude at this point – there will be no stability without growth and no growth without stability. Growth and stability are the two motors that will enable the European economy to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking place, as it is, at an extremely important time for the future of Europe, I want it to be harmonious and effective at one and the same time. I support what has already been voiced by a number of other speakers, namely the wish to allow a new constitutional treaty to see the light of day during this Presidency. Italy is a great European country. It is also a country of great Europeans, and I am sure that, faithful to this heritage, the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Vice-President of the Convention will be very keen to agree upon essentials in order to give Europe a new face.</p>
<p class="contents">This new Constitution that we shall adopt, I hope, by referendum will, as I see it, have one great virtue: that of finally existing. This fundamental text must, however, be a point of departure for a new Europe and not an end in itself. I also think that the next elections will be an opportunity for our fellow citizens to affirm their desire to go further in common European policies, whether it is a question of coordinating economic, budgetary, fiscal and social policies, of creating a Europe of defence and research or of defining a common foreign policy that can finally count for something in the world. That will be the next challenge for those who like this idea of a Europe that both unites and transcends us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency will also have a great responsibility for making advances in the fields of education and culture. You will have to give further impetus to a Europe of knowledge, and I want us to be able to adopt the Erasmus Mundus programme as quickly as possible so that it might be put into effect no later than 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to the meeting of UNESCO’s General Assembly in October 2003, which should tackle the draft international convention on cultural diversity. It is more than desirable that the EU should adopt a clear and public position on this draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to express the wish that this Italian Presidency might be informed by the spirit of the signatories of the Treaty of Rome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask you please to do everything necessary to make it possible. The European Union must contribute its own approach to the fight against terrorism, particularly since we have seen recently that the military approach has its limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has it limitations in relation to the issue of immigration. Through military means we resolve nothing, and I am not talking about rights, I am talking about effectiveness. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is nothing easier than to criticise the immigration policy of the current government. You, Italy, are a clear example. You attacked the last government on the issue of immigration, and now you are faced with the same or worse problems and you do not even need the opposition to say so: they say it within your own government.</p>
<p class="contents">You ask us not to bring Italian arguments here. Let us make a pact: I would ask you exactly the same thing. Do not raise the tone by bringing the problems you cannot resolve nationally to the seat of the European Union. Do not bring the Italian debate on immigration here. We do not need it. We do not need an escalation of press headlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we need to continue with the Thessaloniki conclusions, with their content and with the tone in which they have been written. We need to establish an admission policy, a policy on border control, on integration – a word which has disappeared from your programme – and dialogue with third countries, not on illegal immigration, but on immigration, on all aspects of immigration. In a measured and rational tone, without mixing up illegality, security and legality, without insinuations which are always at play, not because it is not politically correct, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but because then we would fail in our management of immigration and in the fight against crime and we cannot afford to do that.</p>

Europe will only be great, however, if it can preserve its ability to compete in the economic field. As you said, Europe will be able to exert influence if it can act decisively. If, today, there is a ghost haunting Europe, it is the risk of losing its competitive ability on a world scale. I therefore applaud your mention of the Lisbon strategy and also the reference in your programme to competitiveness in the service of shared prosperity. Since Lisbon, Mr President-in-Office, three years have been wasted – and I mean wasted. That is why it is right to seek new lines of development and new economic instruments, as you have done. We need imagination, we need the ability to see beyond what is obvious, and therefore the proposal to build up our infrastructure, both tangible and intangible (such as human resources and research), by mobilising private resources as well as public funds is the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to bring the subject of a sustainable pensions system to European Union level. Many of us, in this Parliament and outside, are convinced that your Presidency will be the key to success in this critical period in the construction of a united Europe. I should like to remind those who today have brought us the venom of a certain mediocre kind of Italian politics that in a democracy it is the citizens’ votes that give legitimacy, and nothing else. Perhaps for them the concept of democracy is too recent for them to have adopted it completely. We, as Italians and Europeans, are proud that you are going to lead Europe for these six months. I wish you every success in your work, Mr President-in-Office! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had to download it from the web and read it in English this morning. Fortunately, I understand English, but I regret that I do not understand Italian. But I would not have needed very much English to read what I found in your programme about environmental policy, because there was not really anything to read. You said a few nice friendly things that could easily have been copied from a daily paper. As you referred to the Lisbon process, I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, whether you are aware that the Lisbon process calls for sustainability and environmental measures to be incorporated into all other areas of policy? If you are aware of that, could you please tell me how you intend to achieve it? I would also be grateful if you could confirm that your government has issued a paper entitled <span class="italic">Environment as an Opportunity</span>, which envisages that the Italian Presidency should use these six months to limit EU environmental legislation and downgrade it. If that is correct, Mr Berlusconi, I presume that you will have the paper pulped immediately and condemn it as being illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also be grateful if you could tell me whether you will use your presidency to ensure that existing EU legislation is transposed into Italian law, as in the case of environmental impact assessment, for instance. I would be grateful if you could tell us, Mr Berlusconi, whether people who do not comply with that legislation will be the subject of criminal prosecution, because non-compliance is an offence, and I also call on the Commission to take appropriate action if it is aware of such non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Berlusconi, I would be grateful if you could tell me if during your presidency you will also be pursuing the environmental legislation for which you will be responsible, and in particular whether environmental responsibility will be on the agenda during your presidency. I would be grateful if you could explain how you intend to take that forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am a great Italophile and a friend of <span class="italic">Alleanza nazionale</span> and of <span class="italic">Forza Italia</span> in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi wisely refers positively to the wider European debate. I agree, and I welcome strengthening the links with Ukraine and Moldova in particular. I would ask for a formal acknowledgement for the first time that under Article 49 of the Treaty they are entitled to apply for eventual EU membership. Nevertheless, the absence in Chisinau of a European Commission delegation and the fact that Italy, unlike Britain, France and Germany, does not have an embassy in Moldova – in spite of links with the Romanian-speaking peoples – is regrettable. Pressure must be brought to finally resolve the Transnistrian question, which truncates and corrupts the Moldovan state. The regime recently snubbed a delegation of MEPs from this House from entering the occupied territory. Pressure on Russia and Ukraine would help solve this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also that the EU engages constructively with Belarus where, notwithstanding our differences, we must engage positively in areas of mutual interest, like border controls, and in order to encourage reforms and democracy and discourage self-isolation by that government.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Council to grant a political mandate to the EIB for the first time to extend its operations to Ukraine and Moldova in expectation of their eventual EU candidatures. After all, the EIB is already active in Russia, where I, of course, welcome Mr Berlusconi's interest and engagement. I applaud the beefing up of the trans-European networks and a good start would be for a fast train between Brussels and Strasbourg to make our lives as MEPs much more bearable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the reinvigoration of the Lisbon Agenda, without which our continent will lose out to the emerging markets of the East and the proposed free-trade areas of the Americas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I welcome Italy's efforts to robustly secure Europe's southern frontiers against illegal immigration. However, how can this be reconciled with the Commission's communication on a wider Europe, which seems to controversially promise eventual freedom of movement to people from the Euro-Med partnership countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is important work to be done and I am hopeful that, despite the concerns that many of us have with regard to your exercise of power in Italy, the European agenda will be advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The judgment that this House will make in relation to your work as President-in-Office will be based on how well you advance the European agenda. Other matters will be dealt with in the fullness of time by the Italian electorate and presumably also the Italian courts. However, in terms of what we must do now, the most important issue that you must address is the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the Intergovernmental Conference is not allowed to withdraw into the shadows. The Convention on the Future of Europe has met in public, has debated in public, all the issues have been thrashed out in public. Unelected diplomats should not be allowed to withdraw behind closed doors to dismantle the good work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore an extremely important responsibility of your presidency to ensure that the documentation of the Intergovernmental Conference is made available in public, as well as all responses to that documentation. It is not enough simply to have occasional, carefully-edited reports presented to this House every now and then over the next six months. We need to know exactly what is going on. The public needs to know, the national parliaments need to know and the European Parliament needs to know the debate that is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference. We cannot ensure the support of the electorate of Europe for the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference unless people are fully engaged in the debate that takes place there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The approach of negotiation announced by Mr Berlusconi is the approach of wisdom and true hard work, the approach that Europe needs in everyone’s interests. The facts speak for themselves: Europe is at an historic turning-point, it is about to give itself a constitution, but the draft presented has received general acceptance which for the time being, however, has glossed over the objections of several governments, and these objections will surface at the Intergovernmental Conference. Negotiation will be the only means of reaching a positive conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In foreign policy there are four objectives: the Middle East peace process; restoring the transatlantic relationship, which has been damaged by the Iraqi crisis; launching new operations in the Balkans run by European forces under the European flag; and lastly the dialogue with the southern Mediterranean countries, which is one of the strong points in the line of action of the European Commission, under the excellent leadership of Romano Prodi. In these cases too, the negotiation you have indicated, Mr President-in-Office, will be decisive. Since your first appearance in this House, you needed to clarify not only the priorities of the Italian Presidency but also the methods it intended to use, and you have done so clearly, coherently and with a sense of true democracy, especially when you announced greater involvement for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we appreciate the commitment to boost the Union’s economy and define the future of the common agricultural policy, and highlight your spirit of collaboration on thorny problems like immigration and the security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by expressing my pride as an Italian Member of this Parliament – a feeling that any other European Member would feel in these circumstances – at taking part in a founding action of the European Union, a Union which is today led by two Italian representatives, Silvio Berlusconi and Romano Prodi. We are certain they will not disappoint us but will, instead, prove worthy of Italy’s history and the creation of the Community. Mr Berlusconi, your Presidency will be successful, despite the Italian and European malcontents who rant and rail today, and you will have the full support of the Christian Democrat group in this Parliament. I wish you success, as this will be the success of Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this Presidency is to be successful, the period of euroscepticism which only a little while ago led the Italian Government to voice reservations about the single currency must be completely left behind.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the aim that the Italian Presidency has made its priority should from now on be acknowledged as a positive one. That objective is to reinvigorate the European economy, which is currently stagnant and appears overly-dependent on the recovery of the US economy. It is therefore important to acquire detailed knowledge of the new Presidency’s concrete proposals, from the launch of a broad-based programme of investment in infrastructure, backed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), to a reopening of the debate on the flexibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, which forces European economies into a strait-jacket of budgetary constraints, even when, as now, their growth rates are negative or very close to zero.</p>
<p class="contents">This Presidency, regardless of who happens to be at the helm, can only succeed fully if everyone shares the desire for European integration to succeed. I wish the President success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to expedite and complete the conciliation procedure on the second rail package, and the second is the conciliation procedure on the ports directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As European Parliament rapporteur, I appeal to the Italian Presidency to give priority to these two legislative proposals, since promoting rail transport and ports could well be in Italy's national interest also. The Italian Government in particular could have a great interest in the further gradual opening up of rail networks, thus revitalising the rail sector and shifting more goods and passengers from road to rail. As Parliament’s rapporteur, I wish to offer the presidency an early conciliation procedure in the context of the second reading in Parliament, so that we can complete the second rail package by the end of the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing the efficiency of port services by means of increased competition and transparency could, however, also be in the interest of the Union as a whole, as well as of Italy with its long coastline and its pivotal role in the Mediterranean. That is why I hope that the Italian Presidency will take this conciliation procedure seriously and accept it as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of calling on you, as a former member of our group and as a friend of our group, to help us in expediting these two important transport projects, that is opening up rail networks and opening up port services to increased competition and greater efficiency, by working quickly and effectively with us. Thank you very much!</p>

I am sure, Mr Berlusconi, that you, as an Italian, will share this satisfaction and understand that any reservations, concerns and demands directed at you reflect everyone’s expectations for the Presidency of a great founding and federating country of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now express my concerns and expectations as Chairman of the Committee for Constitutional Affairs. The Convention on the future of Europe has been an innovation of extraordinary importance. The draft Constitution it has adopted will certainly be referred, under the Treaty, for final decisions by the Heads of State and Government, but it would be foolish to call into question the most significant innovations in it after sixteen months of hard work put in by the representatives from the governments, the national parliaments and the European Parliament. You, Mr Berlusconi, have talked about differences of opinion and hence the need for negotiation, but significant efforts at negotiation have already been made in the Convention, and in its Praesidium in particular. Negotiation by the Italian Presidency in the preparation and running of the Intergovernmental Conference must aim at further advancement of the draft Constitution, clearly addressing those essential options that have remained unresolved, which the President of the Commission pointed out today and also yesterday morning in this House. Parliament fully agrees with the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are shortly going to vote here on a resolution tabled by members of the PPE-DE, PSE and ELDR Groups, calling for a courageous formulation of Parts III and IV of the Constitution and, in particular, further extension of qualified majority voting. As Parliament, we shall make our contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference in the ways that have been indicated by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that you have undertaken to propose to the Council. I too naturally welcome the way you have taken a position and I hope it will be extended to the other aspects suggested by Mr Barón Crespo. I hope, Mr Berlusconi, you will look upon the dialogue with our Parliament dispassionately and with an open mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The true aim of politics must be the noble government of people’s needs, in a society that is constantly changing at an ever-increasing rate. To do this one needs great political sensitivity to manage the technostructure and oppose technocracy. The society governed in this way consists, in simple terms, of a vast majority of ordinary, good, simple people: men, women, young, old, children, of varying abilities, who work and live anonymously but are driven by good and simple feelings of solidarity and love. This is the important Europe that we have to address, by moulding the economic structure to the growth of these ordinary people, who should not have to live with the insecurity and instability in which the globalised economy would trap them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Atlantic partnership with all the Americas is not just an economic and political need or choice; it is a cultural fact that arises from our common roots and shared values. It should be strengthened, it must grow, not least through the transformation of NATO into a tool of international policing at the service of a reformed United Nations, going beyond the rationale of Yalta.</p>
<p class="contents">A last thought concerns world poverty. There is too much poverty, and it requires aid. Therefore, in the discussion on the Union’s financial perspective, we should boldly and decisively set ourselves the target of increasing our contribution to 2% of GDP, because opening up our markets and reforming our institutions is not enough for the international agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I hope our Italian Presidency will have a very great ability to listen, because that is the only way it will be able to celebrate the Constitution of the new Europe, and also to satisfy the Commission under Romano Prodi, a staunch champion of the Community method and of the Europe we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly mean to recognise the historic importance of these events, but I should like to call your attention, Mr President-in-Office, to the very ordinary nature of the work done by the European institutions. We need to make step-by-step progress on many important files, and I refer in particular to the traffic and transport sector, which Mr Jarzembowski has already mentioned. This sector is in a happy situation, with the arrival of the Van Miert proposal, which has finally given us a new programme of new projects that are equal to the challenges facing us as a continent; your government’s proposal of an ingenious way to finance these projects; and the Commission’s proposal to increase European funding to 20%. This is certainly a scenario with significant possibilities, but we have to round it off, Mr President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been a little remiss in the matter of liberalising port services, in the matter of the railway package and as regards the thorny, age-old problem of the Alpine passes. Tomorrow, Parliament will be voting for the umpteenth time on a call to shelve the ecopoints idea, and I hope this time the Council will agree to follow our lead. Then there is the air sector, and the maritime safety sector. Just an example, then, Mr President-in-Office, to remind you of the commitment which, I am sure, your presidency will be ready to demonstrate in these areas, particularly because every time we manage to make some progress with these files we shall be showing our fellow European citizens tangible proof that Europe offers greater opportunities, well-being and prosperity for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paradoxically, I believe all of this is a good sign, Mr Berlusconi: remember that malice of this kind was loudly voiced in 2001 and only contributed to your resounding victory in those elections. I should like to hope that, after all this initial noise, the success of the Italian Presidency will be judged not on the private affairs of Mr Berlusconi the citizen or on your conflict of interests – which you are trying to resolve and I hope will resolve soon – but on your ability to impart that much-needed leadership and impetus to the construction of Europe, and today’s programme speech was an excellent first step in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am sure that in this area, the area that concerns me, some problems can be resolved, such as mending the damaged relations with the United States. Progress will be made on other issues, such as the Middle East, where Italy has already shown great diplomatic skill, or the assimilation of the new countries that are about to join, who quite rightly see in Mr Berlusconi a defender of their interests and their principles, a political leader who, unlike others, has understood that there is no contradiction between European commitment and Atlantic solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr Berlusconi, I believe your task remains a difficult one, because there will be no concessions for you: every decision, every gesture you make will be subjected to close appraisal and scrutiny, and you will not be forgiven for any false move. However, this is not the first time you have undergone this kind of examination: good luck, Mr Berlusconi! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competitiveness, social cohesion, solidarity across generations, the valuing of human resources, solidarity towards the countries in the many southern parts of the world are not just many objectives within our reach, but they are also the founding values of the best episodes in our peoples’ histories. Today, we are faced with a great opportunity: to combine the constitutional process with the will and the need for reform – reform as the steady, day-to-day implementation of that work in progress that is, and will be, our formal Constitution. The conditions, both positive and negative, are all there to be turned into opportunities: an integrated internal market, as Mr Prodi has mentioned, the largest and richest in the world; low interest rates, but also – a negative point that can be turned into an opportunity – still high unemployment; job markets that are still too inflexible; and insufficient infrastructure. The action plan you have proposed, Mr President-in-Office, for developing the great trans-European infrastructure networks through public and private investment, is a step in this direction. As is well known, investment in infrastructure produces higher returns through Keynes’s multiplier, greater competitiveness, and more economic and social cohesion in the north, south, east and west.</p>
<p class="contents">The same may be said for the objective of making our welfare systems sustainable through reform, not by taking away but by giving more with fairness (not least to our children), guarantees and security. Infrastructure investment and welfare reform, however, require an efficient, flexible, well-structured labour market that is well regulated and fairer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you won the Italian elections with a modernising programme, just as the programme you have presented today is modernising. There is no doubt that you will carry them both through. I wish you good luck and success in your work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My confusion has been caused to a great extent by the acumen of some of the speeches that came before. I no longer know whether the President-in-Office will preside over the IGC in Rome in the fullness of his prerogatives or whether, as Enrique Barón Crespo claims, he will be an occasional guest of the mayor of that city. Most of all, however, I no longer know whether the epithet ‘human atom bomb’ should be applied, as it has been historically, to the unforgettable Rita Hayworth, or whether it should be transferred, as Mrs Frassoni would have it, to Vice-President Fini.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in order to set my values straight, I have decided to make a dull but clear speech, something along the lines of ‘God, country and family’, hinging on the subject of Europe’s Christian roots, which is not an ideological subject but one of democratic procedures. Indeed, this reference is not a contribution to the clerical concerns of certain social groups but the historical memory of the truest meaning behind our institutions. Our democratic institutions are in fact the result of a freedom pact with the citizens, who transfer some of their own sovereignty to them in exchange for guarantees and services. From this viewpoint, the states and especially the supranational institutions, are guarantors of the attempts that we citizens make to respond to our needs – they are guarantors, not masters – and they are such because they are well aware that they cannot be the final answer to people’s heartfelt desires. The reference to Europe’s Christian roots merely shows that today’s Europe realises that, without its bond with the uniting and personalistic tension of Christianity, it will always be weaker, more exposed to the political short cuts of totalitarian regimes. To be able to reject humanity to the utmost, such regimes have always preferred to begin by rejecting God, though for less explicit reasons than the politically correct of today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reformist Party and extend my thanks to the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Barón Crespo, who expressed his critical demands with great courtesy and also a subtle sense of humour. I should like to tell him that I am still convinced that the great Europe of the future, if it genuinely wants to be a leader in world politics able to sit at a table on equal terms with the United States, will have to be a great Europe that can also include Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Israel, the Russian Federation and its military strength. This is certainly a vision that the Prime Minister of Italy has, and one that he can, of course, express quite freely when speaking for himself and for his government, but when the Prime Minister becomes the President-in-Office of the European Council he has to adhere to the prevailing opinion within the European Council, and it is therefore clear that what he says and the activities to which he must devote himself have of necessity to reflect the mandate he is given by his fellow members of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also want to respond to that other witticism, that a dyed-in-the-wool liberal has at last adopted a doctrine that forms part of socialist thinking, that is, Keynesianism. I agree with you, sir, that one might find a Keynesian or Colbertian flavour in the request for European intervention through the EIB and the raising of private capital in order to realise major trans-European infrastructure, which were proposed as much as ten years ago by Mr Delors, but, you see, we are faced by a fact that nobody can deny. What has happened in the world since 11 September? There has been the war in Afghanistan, there has been the war in Iraq, but, above all, the world stock markets have crashed. This has caused a reduction in all the financial assets invested in shareholdings and has caused a critical cut in all their returns. If you used to have assets worth 100, you now have assets worth 35; if you used to get a return of 8 or 10% on your assets, you now get a return of 1%. This has led to a reduction in private-sector demand on the market for consumer goods and high-value consumer goods, and, therefore, when private-sector demand falls, when consumption falls, there is nothing one can do but call on public-sector demand to sustain the economy. This public-sector demand cannot come from individual Member States, because the individual states can no longer develop a monetary policy because there is the euro, they cannot change exchange rates, and they cannot create a development policy, for the simple reason that they have to keep within the Maastricht parameters. Thus, it is Europe alone that must, at last, create its own economic policy capability. Italy’s proposal is that Europe, through one of its institutions, the EIB, should raise those private capital funds that are on the market and can be had at low interest rates, in order to try to boost demand through transnational infrastructure works, through the need to invest in new military technology, and through investment in research and education. The fact that we are faced with an economic situation that has changed is the only justification for resorting to state investment and, in this case, European Union investment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I shall also, if I may, answer that point you put to me when you said, ‘I hope Mr Berlusconi’s Italian flair for making laws just for specific cases that are, perhaps, somehow of close interest to him will not be extended to the European level.’ I should like to quote you some figures to remind you that my government, which is Italy’s fifty-seventh in 50 years and has the responsibility – and also the opportunity, seeing that it has a large majority in both sections of parliament – to work for five years, is putting 24 different reforms into practice. In fact, it inherited a country in which none of the previous governments, which were only able to work for less than five years on average, was, of course, able to do this. I remind you that my government has drafted a record three hundred and fifty bills and decree-laws, two hundred of which have already been passed by our majority in parliament. Therefore, while I do not admit you are right, I can say that those three bills were a response – using a democratic method, a parliamentary vote – to a person who takes advantage of their position as an officer of justice to use the courts to attack their political enemies; although I believe that this has happened, it has only happened in three cases out of 350: 1%, Mr Barón Crespo.</p>
<p class="contents">I confirm, however – God forgive you if you did not know – that we shall be keeping Members of Parliament and Parliament itself informed on the progress of our negotiation operation, which it will not be at all easy to complete in the short time available. We shall be using the time between now and about 15 October to contact the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of all the other 24 European Union Member States so that, at the opening of the Conference, we can already present some possible solutions on which everyone can agree.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, of course, also like to thank the other Members who have spoken – Mr Graham Watson, Mrs Monica Frassoni, Mr Francis Wurtz – for wishing me success in my work. I must, however, reply to them and to all those who have given an utterly distorted view of Italy that is far from the truth. I invite them to come and enjoy something that the Berlusconi government has clearly not succeeded in eliminating, which is Italy’s sunshine, its beauty, its 100 000 monuments and churches, our 3 500 museums, our 2 500 archaeological sites, the 40 000 historical houses in Italy, which we have not managed to destroy over the last two years. Mr Schultz, I know there is a producer in Italy who is making a film about Nazi concentration camps. I will suggest you for the role of guard. You would be perfect!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter, protests from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude this diatribe by saying that my Social Democrat friends and colleagues should probably expand their acquaintances beyond the Italian Members they find here in Parliament and they should perhaps extend their reading beyond the far left newspapers, which have evidently shaped these convictions of theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to reply to Mr Pannella, who made a point about the personal line that I have consistently followed, and which I still believe in, with regard to Israel – which I mentioned a moment ago – and Turkey. I must tell him as well that, in the coming six months, I must expound the line of the European Council; after that I shall have the opportunity, within the European Council, to uphold these views of mine, which are, of course, not views for the next six months or that can be realised in one term of office but visions that will require much longer to come to fruition. I can reassure him, however, as regards the moratorium on the death penalty. I have always upheld the need for this intervention, and I shall therefore certainly take this demand to the United Nations Assembly in September as a demand from the European Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Another thing that has been ascribed to me is subservience to the United States. I have recalled several times that I see Europe as a joint protagonist in maintaining security and peace, for the development of well-being throughout the world, but to do this Europe must not be just an economic giant but an economic giant that can also find a way to express itself with a single voice on foreign policy, and one that can also invest more in its military forces. No diplomacy, no policy in history has ever been successful without the support of adequate military strength. With regard to the United States, I think we should be friends of the United States, but I do not believe there has been anything in the Italian Government’s conduct that could be seen as subservience. I repeatedly tried to dissuade the person who has been mentioned here as being my friend, President George Bush, from launching a military initiative in Iraq. I did not succeed, and then I insisted – even signing that letter with seven other European Union Member States, to which 10 other countries were then added, including, first and foremost, some of the new Members of the European Union – that one evil, the war in Iraq, should not be followed by other evils, and particularly that it should not be followed by the discrediting of the United Nations, which I regret to say did happen since it was shown to be impotent, or by the crisis in transatlantic relations, which did happen; or by the final evil, which is the division among the countries of Europe, something which did happen and which we are all endeavouring to put right and overcome together.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the conflict of interests which many have mentioned: well, perhaps you are not aware that, in Italy, the newspapers and the television channels that still belong to my group and my family, especially, are among our strongest critics. Why? Clearly, you have not experienced Italy’s sunshine; you have never been to Italy and you have never tuned into an Italian television channel. You ought to know – and yet many of you have a background in journalism – that the greatest concern of all journalists is to appear independent to their colleagues. This independence leads them to be constantly critical towards the one they consider the boss. If this is the kind of democracy you mean to use to silence the President-in-Office of the European Council, I can tell you that you should come to Italy as tourists, because you look like democracy tourists here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Uproar on the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I was leader of the opposition in Italy for six years, so these speeches do not frighten me: I am used to being contradicted. On immigration, I should like to remind you that, if there is one country that is rooted in Christianity, a generous country, open to those who have the least and to those who suffer, I am proud to say that this country is mine, Italy. Let us not, therefore, confuse the war we must all wage together against the traffickers of slaves, the new slave trade, with the welcome we must give to those who come to improve their lives on the continent of Europe. We give them this welcome, and we give it generously. We want to fight this new form of slavery which is emerging through numerous international organisations: no more than that, and there is nothing in that which might cast doubt on Italy’s generosity.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the environment, perhaps the Greens are not aware that Mr Berlusconi’s favourite hobby is to do with flowers, nature, gardens and parks. It has been practically my only hobby since football left me behind. If you read page 49 of our programme, Mrs Frassoni, you will find that we want to introduce high levels of environmental protection; our policy, over and above the way it is being misrepresented, is directed precisely towards greater protection of the environment, and we are the first to be puzzled by the fact that, all too often, the expansion of production and industry has been to the detriment of the environment. In relation to the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, here too we shall take steps to convince those who have not signed it to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to my adversaries, with a smile, that they should not make a tragedy out of our Presidency. when all is said and done, six months pass very quickly. To my friends, however, those who have encouraged us and will continue to encourage us, I should like to say that, with regard to a man’s past and the man himself, I believe the important thing is not just what he says – in politics, very often, one changes, or other people change, the things one says – but his record, what he has done. Well, I believe that there are only successes in my record and only good intentions behind my actions. Therefore, we shall also make these six months bear fruit and try to reach a conclusion that enables Europe to be a positive factor for world peace, security and prosperity. We shall apply ourselves to our work, Mr President, with humility, dedication and conviction; we shall apply ourselves to brokering a solution from the various, still widely differing positions of the different Member States, that will give us a stronger Europe, able to make decisions on the international stage; that will give us a Europe through the new Constitution, a Europe that is closer to its citizens. This is our hope; this is our undertaking; this is our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you again for your good wishes for our work, and I wish you all every success in your work. May you succeed in making all your heartfelt hopes reality. My best wishes to all of you and, once again, good luck with your work!</p>

However, I am quite clear in my mind that it is very difficult to accept a situation in which a President-in-Office of the Council, when he comes up against the slightest contradiction during a debate, loses his composure in this way.</p>

The objective that stands out above all others is the Intergovernmental Conference, which is to give us a Constitution that should not only contain an architecture for our institutions but also constitute a set of visions, values and models of society. We expect a lot from the Italian Presidency, because this is our great challenge and because this Constitution will dictate the rules of this Europe of ours for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The line of action should lead on from the Greek Presidency, but with certain particularly significant moments. At these moments the Commission will carry out its mandate – a mandate that is not only executive but also one of instigation and proposal – I repeat, leading on in terms of the policies and collaboration that we have built up over these years together with the European Parliament and the various Presidencies. The Commission must be the guarantor of this continuity and it will encourage and help the Italian Presidency to move with us in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate focused precisely on these major problems, and the Commission will put these objectives into practice and carry them out using its institutional methods for representing and promoting the Union’s interests. In what fields? We shall do so in the field of institutional reform, as we have said, in the drive for economic revitalisation, for the normalisation of friendly relations with the United States in a position of dignity and equality; we shall do so by furthering and speeding up the difficult, complicated process of the accession of the Balkan countries into Europe and with the gradual achievement of the project of the ring of friendly countries, thus putting our vision into practice. Here, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recall the debate which has run all this year, focusing on the borders of Europe: a difficult and complicated debate which, you will recall, it was impossible to commence at the beginning of the legislative period, and which looks towards the completion of our Union with the candidate countries, with the addition of the Balkan countries, and looks towards the construction around them of strong, close and friendly relations with the surrounding countries, from Russia to Morocco, with whom we must share everything save our institutions, since our Union must have its own borders, its own strength and its own depth. We shall do so by furthering our work on the security of our citizens, and on the rules for and rights of emigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to dwell just a little more on some of the points I have listed because I consider them key points for our future work. Firstly, I must assure you all that we shall always be true and strict guardians of compliance with the Treaties and the new Constitution. Secondly, we shall strongly support the balanced development of our society. The Lisbon process, which has emerged today as a strong point, is our point of reference, because Europe must overcome the worldwide challenge, but it must overcome it through balanced and socially sustainable development. The increasing differences between the citizens of the various European countries in almost all our nations over the last decade concerns me at least as much as the lack of growth. At this historic moment, we cannot throw social dialogue and consultation out of the window, since these are the pillars of the European social model on which we have laboured so hard in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to infrastructure, we have already underlined our new undertaking and it will be our responsibility and duty to be rigorous and selective in assessing the costs and benefits, and just as rigorous in finding sources of finance that are compatible with our rules and with long-term sustainability. We are working on this side by side with the European Investment Bank, and we shall be making the same effort in the field of research, without which Europe will be a lost continent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to immigration, the Commission will be supporting a European undertaking to combat the new slave traders, but we shall not tolerate, as happened at Thessaloniki, people confusing firmness with inhumanity, or regulation of migration flows with violence and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to international relations, lastly, the Commission maintains its commitment to peace and a multilateral approach to resolving conflicts. Moreover, the Union’s humanitarian commitment will continue to provide the long-term aid that is by far the greatest priority to every country in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the guidelines for the coming six months. I believe it will be a period of cooperation and a period which, with the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, will genuinely open a new chapter in the history of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">We hope, in particular, that it will prove to be clearer and more resolute than the Thessaloniki Council, held two weeks ago. Although it devoted a large proportion of its conclusions to immigration policy – seven and a half pages, compared with the one and a half that came out of the Convention – the Council was particularly obscure, even impossible to understand, defining, in particular, its objective in terms of a ‘two-way process’, aimed at simultaneously fighting illegal immigration and exploring ‘legal migration channels’.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe now needs a clear, firm policy for controlling its borders, returning illegal immigrants to their own countries and reforming the right of asylum in order to put an end to abuses. On this subject, we are sorry that the Thessaloniki Council did not really deal with the British demand that transit centres be created, responsible for examining asylum requests at the EU’s external borders, together with ‘regional protection zones’ close to the countries of origin of those requesting asylum. We are relying upon the Italian Presidency to make progress on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
