<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kuckelkorn (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present the guidelines for other sections and the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention is that the guidelines should deal with the essentials and be kept very concise. Details and the consideration of specific measures will be left for the motion on the estimates. Please allow me now to touch briefly on some aspects of this year’s guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The exceptional feature of the budget year 2005 is that it will be the first full budgetary year for the European Union of 25 Member States, the first full year of activity for the newly-elected European Parliament, the newly-appointed Commission, and the first full year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations. Technical adjustment will reduce the ceiling of the financial perspectives of heading 5 for 2005 by EUR 94 million at current prices. On the basis of these budgetary constraints for 2005, new entities such as the European School of Administration may have to be delayed unless savings are made by launching such bodies. The amount of staff in most of the institutions has been increasing rapidly to cater for the needs of the enlargement. The main bulk of these additional needs related to the enlargement are covered in the 2002-2004 budgets, even if a number of measures remain to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the delays in recruitment procedures, a thorough assessment will be made of the situation in view of the 2005 budget. We are assuming that the financial impact of expanding the institutions' premises will occur mainly after 2005. A key question for the 2005 budgetary procedure will continue to be the administrative reforms of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to Parliament (Section I), where several uncertainties relating to the drawing up of Parliament's budget for 2005 need to be considered, such as the current lack of agreement on a Members’ Statute, the actual outcome of the enlargement-related recruitments in 2004, and developments of several building projects. At this stage, therefore, we reserve our position regarding the limit of 20% of the expenditure under heading 5. It is regrettable that the Member States have not yet been able to agree on a Members’ Statute and it is hoped that progress will be made on this during the course of 2004. The same also applies to the Statute for Members’ assistants. As far as the financing of the European Political Parties is concerned, I think we agree that this expenditure should in principle remain outside Parliament’s self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 as it is not an administrative expenditure of the institution but an operational one. However, I am ready to compromise on this particular point and accept the text of Mrs Buitenweg’s Amendment No 8, which leaves open the option of including this expenditure within the 20% ceiling. In view of the delays in recruitment procedures for staff from the new Member States and difficulties encountered in recruiting especially linguistic staff from certain new Member States, we consider that a decision on making appropriations available for additional enlargement-related staff can only be taken at the first reading of the 2005 budget. A mid-term plan for building projects is necessary in order to define the level of Parliament's budget in 2005 in view of possible capital injections needed to pursue the property policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the functioning of the car service, we need to re-evaluate it to see if it provides a satisfactory service to Members while guaranteeing value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Council (Section II), the Council is asked to consider presenting its estimates with the Preliminary Draft Budget instead of its first reading to increase transparency. Parliament will also continue to monitor the Council operational budget, while respecting the Gentlemen's Agreement as regards the administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Court of Justice (Section IV), here we note that this institution has, in the last couple of years, experienced higher growth rates in staff than most other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Court of Auditors (Section V), we mention that the Court of Auditors has distributed its enlargement-related staff increase over the 2004 and 2005 budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the Economic and Social Committee (Section VI) and the Committee of the Regions (Section VII), we ask both committees to pursue budgetary rigour in their estimates, especially in staff requests and building projects, and to improve the cooperation as regards the joint services to fully benefit from the new joint premises. We expect that the move to the Belliard building and the vacation of the current buildings will take place as foreseen.</p>
<p class="contents">A few points did not make it through the vote in the Committee on Budgets. We present again to the House only the most important of these, on which I would ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the moment the usual advocates of budgetary rigour and saving are more necessary and more realistic than ever, because now there is a reduction in the ceiling for heading 5 and I would find it difficult to name any rapporteur who was more notorious than Mr Kuckelkorn for their rigour to carry out these cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am genuinely curious to see the report of the General Secretaries of the institutions on the estimates of the administrative needs for 2005. I believe it is going to be a very fortunate and beneficial year for everybody since the Secretaries of the various institutions are going to have to reconcile enlargement and its administrative requirements with the restriction we are going to be faced with next year of the reduction of EUR 140 million in heading 5. By the way, this rigour which is being asked of the other institutions must also be applied to the Commission and to the European Parliament itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group, Mr Kuckelkorn, believes it is perfectly possible to remain next year within the 20% limit for the European Parliament’s budget, particularly after the Council, as a result of the opposition, above all, of the German Government, has blocked the reform of the Members’ Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has presented and defended amendments in the Committee on Budgets in particular on the issue of multilingualism and its implementation. We tried this in the 2004 budget and we would be very happy to find now that we have an interlocutor open to dialogue on the possible initiatives our group is presenting. At the moment the report, voted on in the Committee on Budgets, supports it.</p>
<p class="contents">We entirely agree with the rest of the measures in Mr Kuckelkorn’s report and we are finally left with the issue of the funding of the political parties. My group would have liked – and we were one vote away from achieving it in the Committee on Budgets – that committee to express its support for including this funding of European political parties within Parliament’s limit of 20%. What we did not want with this amendment we are presenting was to have to negotiate the funding of the political parties year after year, which would be the case if we were funding outside the limit of 20%. Funding them within the 20% limit would prevent this situation and would ensure a quick negotiation by means of a transfer. We should remember that the code of conduct necessary for this transfer to political parties is due to be finalised very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, because of the opposition of other political groups, and particularly yours, Mr Kuckelkorn, this has not been possible and therefore the compromise solution proposed in the amendment of the Greens/ALE Group seems to us to be acceptable as the only way to avoid jeopardising this transfer, which must be carried out in 2004, in this budgetary year. Furthermore, with this compromise, with this amendment from the Greens, we would prevent the budgetary restriction of heading 5 from jeopardising the functioning of the political parties during next September, as they themselves warn, which may be faced with serious operating problems of an administrative nature if this transfer does not take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Mr Kuckelkorn is prepared to take this compromise into account – to vote for this amendment – and, if this is the case, Mr President, I believe that the rest of the vote on the report by Mr Kuckelkorn will be practically unanimous because, on the rest of the major issues, we fully share his thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next year’s budget is very rigorous in terms of the administrative budget, as the rapporteur stated. The fact that this year we shall have ten new Member States and the same number of new official languages makes it all the more rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Parliament’s multilingualism is an enormous challenge. It calls for a new kind of flexibility in the areas of translation and interpreting. Nowhere else in the world is there a body that functions so multilingually as the EU institutions. This nevertheless requires special action and care; otherwise, the multicultural principle could become chaos. That is why the administration should make a special effort to ensure that the posts are filled and the translation work flows smoothly right from the moment of accession. In the new environment there will be an increase in retour interpreting. This could lead to a situation where all of Parliament is dependent on one interpreter who is translating from a less common official language into a more common one. To ensure the quality of translation work it will be necessary to translate from more than one interpretation booth. This in practice means making special demands on the ‘bigger’ language groups, such as English, French and German, making it necessary for them to be able to translate from more source languages than the other interpreter groups.</p>
<p class="contents">A major political issue in recent years has been the adoption of the Members’ Statute. It was hugely disappointing that it should have become the subject of internal disagreements in the Council. The European Parliament, and its current President, Patrick Cox, in particular, had worked very hard dealing with this matter, and, consequently, it was too bad that it was torpedoed. It is important that the Members’ Statute is adopted speedily, so that it could come into effect preferably by the start of the next parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s budget at long last saw the implementation of activity-based budgeting as far as the Commission is concerned. It allows us to see directly how much each activity costs. The same activity-based budgeting approach should also gradually be applied to the administrative budget, to the European Parliament, for example. This way we would also be in a better position to monitor developments in administrative costs and expenditure in different administrative branches. I would like to wish the rapporteur every success in his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunate that the Council could not adopt the new Members’ Statute. When the European Parliament itself voted in favour of reviewing its own salary and travel expenses system, it was a big step in the right direction. It is not morally right to try to cheat on travel expenses, even if it is not actually against the rules of Parliament to travel tourist class for the price of a business class ticket. As Members themselves were prepared to entirely give up this unjustifiable source of income for the sake of the airlines, it was unfortunate that the Council did not take up the offer. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden are now to blame for the justified criticism that the public make of the flaws in the pay and expenses system used in respect of Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A problem has also arisen with the Council concerning another matter. The Council wants pan-European political party support for the European Parliament’s budget, whilst Parliament would like it for the Commission’s budget. If there is Europarty support for the budget it cannot be allowed to impact on Parliament’s maximum total for administrative expenditure, resulting in forced cuts in other areas. Then there are also those of us who do not want Europarty support and who will vote against its introduction in this year’s draft supplementary budget. Then there is still a good number of Members of the European Parliament who have referred the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a decision. We are starting to pay for party support for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Europarty support blurs democracy. The national parties of the ‘big’ countries can use it to dominate European party decision-making far more easily. The representatives of the ‘smaller’ countries would have a double problem, as they would have to make themselves heard in a Europarty dominated by the ‘large’ nations before gaining a hearing in a European Parliament elected on the basis of Member States’ populations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that Parliament retains multilingualism and that personnel selection considers nationals from all countries. There must also be recruitment from countries other than the new Member States. Some Member States are under-represented on the parliamentary staff because Parliament has not properly organised staff recruitment competitions. Parliament must aim to keep increases in expenditure under tight control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, the Commission's administrative reform has only just recently got up to speed. The Commission will need to make every effort to achieve sound financial management, a well-functioning information system and fully reliable accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, is right to refer to the possibility of saving costs by inter-institutional cooperation. Considerable savings could be made if this Parliament were no longer forced to meet in Strasbourg, but this appears legally impossible without cooperation from France. That is why I would suggest to the Bureau that the Council, or the French Republic, should be presented with the bill for the dual location, which amounts to over EUR 200 million per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group emphasises the huge importance of multilingualism in this House. Parliament should not enhance, but rather undo, the public’s image of it as an elite club. Every citizen must be able to follow all public meetings in their own language. Democracy in diversity is the core task of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact remains that the Haug report and the Kuckelkorn report have one thing in common which deserves attention and which also deserves a much wider debate than we are allowed here. Both of them start by calling for sound management and rigour. Later, however, in the report we are concerned with here, we read that, for its own budget, Parliament reserves its position on the 20% increase limit which it imposed upon itself for administrative expenditure. We also read, in the explanatory statement to the Haug report – and I quote – ‘new own resources should be introduced that do not take the form of contributions of the Member States and do not, taken as a whole, increase the tax burden on ordinary citizens’. The situation is clear then: the majority of Parliament wants to increase the Union’s budget, in particular in order to fund enlargement. The European tax is something that is on everyone’s mind, though in a form that is disguised to a greater or lesser extent. There is nothing surprising in that; promises have to be funded and resources are not inexhaustible.</p>
<p class="contents">I look to the rapporteurs and the Commission to explain how it is possible to increase the European budget without increasing the tax burden on taxpayers except by reducing the national budgets. If the majority accepts this principle of ‘communicating vessels’, governments and finance ministers will have to make it clear to the public which policies and measures funded from the national budget will bear the cost, in a context which is already one of rigour, and of which the Commission claims to be the guardian, inasmuch as it takes action against those States which do not comply with the stability pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
