<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahrton (Greens/ALE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, it is of course an incredibly important event when the EU is to enter into an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with the People’s Republic of China, because we all know that China is the big country which will decide a large part of our common future. </p>
<p class="contents">My own basic attitude to the agreement, as rapporteur, and also that of the Committee, is that this is a good Agreement. It is important and positive that we should go through this process in order to reach an agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese Authorities have recently introduced a number of reforms in line with the broad principles agreed at the 1992 United Nations World Conference on Environment and Development in Rio. The European Union is prepared to offer further support to the Chinese Government towards achieving its objectives. That is part of the agreement. This should especially improve environmental protection and limit the negative impact of industrial growth and urbanisation on the well-being of the Chinese population. It is important that this should be stated clearly in the texts of the agreement and that we understand that our type of industrialisation has many positive sides, but also a number of negative sides. </p>
<p class="contents">For the EU’s part, we are funding joint research projects, especially in biotechnology applied to agriculture, medicine, health care and natural resources. In this regard, concerns have been raised, and with some justice, about the lack of ethical constraints in China, especially in human genetic research. It is very important indeed that we should be well aware of this when we enter into the agreements concerned. Various organisations have also pointed out that there are risks of proliferation of bio-weapons technology. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU will supply technical assistance to develop energy resources and promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and clean or renewable energy supply, as well as promoting the use of environmentally friendly technology. We are now becoming involved with China in aspects of this cooperative work. This is important, not least when it is borne in mind that China produces 15 million tons of sulphur dioxide, causing acid rain, and over 13 million tons of particulate pollutants. These are some of the signs that suggest that our partnership with China is extremely important and could also lead to a better environment for ourselves and the whole world. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee has made up its mind that this is, on balance, a sound agreement. We have accepted it, and I completely support our having done so. I just have a few remarks along the way. They are not binding upon Parliament, as the decision process is, but I hope that the results of certain aspects of scientific cooperation are applied with caution and that, in view of the lack of ethical constraints in China, we avoid cooperation in the field of biotechnology. I think it is very important indeed that we should be sure to check up on what would happen in China following this type of cooperation before we enter into any concrete agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">There is also a quite different aspect of the agreement which has a considerable air of secrecy about it. I am assuming that when section 5 of the annex relating to intellectual property rights is applied, it will be ensured that it is not applied word for word but in a way that accords more with the general rules of openness which now happily apply more and more within our European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I recommend that we accept this agreement with China which is important for ourselves, for China and for our common future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that intensive scientific and technical cooperation will also enhance the overall dialogue between scientists and thus lead to greater freedom of expression, and that this will accordingly be a helpful step towards liberalisation in China. We do not know of any cases where a scientist has been persecuted or arrested because of his scientific work, but I do know that in recent years any number of scientists have been persecuted or arrested because of their political beliefs, and we consider that this opportunity should be taken to make it clear that such people should be released.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to make one more brief comment, as this will shorten this evening’s proceedings: my committee also believes that the report on the scientific and technical agreement with Argentina should also be viewed in a positive light. We have also reached a similar opinion regarding Russia. If the rapporteur, should she touch on this subject, were to propose that this agreement should be abandoned, then the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would totally support this request, as this would be a sensible step given the war in Chechnya, as a means of pointing the way to the future regarding this issue. In any case, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would support such an initiative if the committee responsible could see its way to come to such a decision.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement forms part of the Commission’s policy, as described in various Commission communications in recent years. China also needs to be included in the international research and development framework, and political and economic links need to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and China need to conclude a separate scientific and technological agreement in order to improve and extend cooperation in fields such as energy, the environment, life sciences, abiotic sciences, transport, telematics, information technology and communications. This will serve to strengthen the presence of European economic actors in China. All the Commission representatives who know me will be aware that it is unusual for me to quote their documents at such length!</p>
<p class="contents">Not only will the presence of European economic actors in China be strengthened in this way, but also the presence of Chinese research institutions in the EU. I accordingly believe that this cooperation will be of great benefit to both sides, and that the democratic process can in this way also be promoted through greater cooperation and an enhanced dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working on the assumption that the agreement could contribute to greater freedom of thought. It is certainly unheard of for scientists to be persecuted for talking about science. However, we do know that in many cases freedom of expression cannot always be taken for granted and I now appeal to China to move towards greater democracy and openness in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on behalf of my group I would like to emphasise that we are not in agreement with the rapporteur’s conclusions, as described in his explanatory statement. However, it is not customary for Parliament to vote on explanatory statements. So we will vote for the report, which consists of one sentence. But please do not assume, Mr Gahrton, that your statement reflects the views of this House. At best it represents the views of a small part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that international cooperation is bound to benefit from research, without denying that there are also certain risks. However, in the case of China, I would also like to point out that cooperation with this country in not a one-way process with Europeans bearing their fine gifts on a golden platter – we can also learn from the Chinese.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are going to discuss Argentina later on, I would like to remind you of something. The compass came to us from China via the Arabs, and if we had not been given the compass, we would probably not have discovered America either. We could then forget about the report on Argentina! So European culture has learnt something from China, and I hope that will continue to apply in future. Our problem with China – which has already quite rightly been pointed out and which is not limited to this one country – is human rights. With China there is also the issue of Tibet, their threatening behaviour towards Taiwan, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to warn again using research as a political weapon, as a means of putting pressure on a country over such issues. I do not believe that works. In any case, we end up punishing the wrong people since, in general, scientists are our allies, at least in spirit. The subjects listed here are quite reasonable – health, the environment, food and so forth. Let me remind you that we are not talking about nuclear cooperation. Nor are we planning joint development of arms, no, we are considering reasonable issues of benefit to people there and also, indirectly, to us in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, perhaps I could mention an idea of my own. I can well imagine that in view of China’s great importance it would make sense to have an EU-China research institute or a facility where Chinese and Europeans could work on one or more long-term projects. So Chinese and Europeans would work together on a single site, be it in China or in Europe. An experience of this kind, learning each other’s language and understanding each other’s culture, could be extraordinarily attractive and stimulating for both sides. There is no mention of this in the project, but I simply wanted to propose it here. Perhaps we could consider this when we sign our next agreement with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Collaboration between scientists promotes mutual understanding of each other’s cultures. This could serve as a catalyst to intensify the dialogue with China and, in time, to improve democracy and the human rights situation. </p>
<p class="contents">Since the People’s Republic of China accounts for a quarter of the global population and has great economic potential, its involvement in European research and technological projects is of huge importance. I agree with Rolf Linkohr, both sides can benefit. But a lot can be gained in the field of environment and energy too. Technical support for the promotion of energy efficiency, saving energy and clean and renewable energy sources will enable China to reduce the production of CO2. If there is transfer of expertise then the European Union may be able to achieve part of its own CO2 objectives over there.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns cooperation in the field of information and communication technology. The problem in this context is access to the Internet. The Internet is the first medium which enables worldwide, interactive communication. But the Chinese government wants to monitor the free flow of information and the freedom of speech via the Internet. This will not benefit the development of information and communication technology. In order to continue to grant the Chinese access to the worldwide web, it is essential to cooperate with China in this field. An honest dialogue will keep the door open for new developments, such as e-commerce, where China also forms a large potential market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that everything that we have seen over the last few months shows that the opposite is taking place: the huge increase in the arrest of dissidents, the persecution of the so-called sect, the Falun Gong, etc. Obviously it is possible to maintain a strategic relationship with an undemocratic country, with a dictatorship. The communist regime has many faithful friends here, starting with Mr Gahrton, who is endlessly asking us to resume and strengthen our links with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another country, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, with a billion inhabitants, and which is the largest democracy on earth, India; and we always forget about that country and develop no strategy towards it. Even though it is a democracy, we prefer to talk to dictators. I deplore this, and all the more so because this report, and particularly the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is being particularly hypocritical. We state clearly in the text of the report that at least four people are being held in prison for scientific reasons, contrary to what we have been told by Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. These four people are quoted in this opinion and yet we are not even demanding their release. I think that this shows unbelievable hypocrisy. Let us carry on then; let us close our eyes to India. Let us carry on with China. You will see that the process of democratisation in China leads nowhere. Strength is the only language that communists understand, and in this case, we have no strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, these agreements have been speedily adopted, and I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, as well as the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, for having studied the proposals in a very short time. They are representative of a new generation of agreements for scientific cooperation with third countries. The countries concerned of course are different. Now we are talking about China and we will be talking about Russia and Argentina next. I would nevertheless like to say that these offer real added value to the current situation; they will clarify aims to be pursued, strengthen and extend collaboration, and will provide a solid formal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would also like to say, as Mr Linkohr emphasised, that there is a need for reciprocity which will be in our mutual interest. The European team’s reciprocal access to, in this case, Chinese programmes and activities, is the very spirit of the fifth framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finishing with the general aspects, I would also like to say that I know how much Parliament would like to be kept informed about the implementation of this programme and that the Commission will ensure that it supplies Parliament with regular detailed information on this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as China more particularly is concerned, whilst thanking Mr Gahrton for his report, I would like to say that we know how crucial the human rights problem is and that it is a particularly complex issue. I, as many speakers have said, consider it important to establish cooperation on a scientific level which encourages contact between our researchers and Chinese researchers. In this context, I can only agree with the conclusions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, because this will permit greater freedom of expression for those working in the scientific and technical fields in China as well as in general. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the contribution that the Internet may make, we think that through this kind of contact, and also as you said, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, regarding the problem of e-commerce, a certain kind of dialogue will be possible in the future, as a result of this type of scientific agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the issues of biotechnology are concerned, I must answer Mr Gahrton by saying that all research proposals in the area of biotechnology must completely satisfy the ethical conditions that apply to any framework programme project. This compliance is an essential requirement if the project is to be accepted, which I think gives all the guarantees we would want in order to prevent, as you pointed out, abuses that we would not want to see. Moreover, the framework programme covers only civilian research and the possible areas of cooperation do not lend themselves to its use for military ends. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that as far as the problem of the annex relating to issues of intellectual property is concerned, the same thing applies to the three draft agreements. It is generally the same for all these types of agreements. This text has been drawn up following in-depth discussions with all parties concerned and bears in mind the need to guarantee the best possible protection for the European participants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with a country which does not fulfil the demands for democracy and human rights which we have within the EU. That is quite clear. Do you not believe that we are continually talking with our Chinese friends about this? That is precisely what we are doing. We are, in fact, in constant communication with them about this issue. Whether or not this has any influence upon them is a moot point but, on absolutely each and every occasion that we meet our Chinese counterparts, we tell them that we ourselves have a different view to them about what they are doing where human rights are concerned. We say it openly and to their faces and we say it repeatedly and shall go on saying it. We refer constantly to the resolutions which are adopted by the European Parliament. We tell them that this is not some kind of campaign against China. We tell them that we adopt resolutions against just about every country in the world, including our own countries, when human rights are not respected. We do all this when we meet our Chinese counterparts. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that what we say possibly has very little influence indeed, but it can have influence. We shall not, from our position here in the European Parliament, change China fundamentally – that is something we must realise – but we shall be able to ensure that when in fact China, of its own volition, becomes a more democratic country, we shall have supported the change by maintaining good relations with the country. That is my aim as head of the delegation for cooperation with China. It was also my aim when I wrote this report that we should engage in what would be positive cooperation with China but should definitely not in any way be less critical than the non-governmental organisations which work with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
