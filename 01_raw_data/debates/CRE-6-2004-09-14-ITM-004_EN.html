<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting here in this House to debate the political priorities proposed by the Commission for 2005 and to assess the results of our structured dialogue: a <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> which has now been operating for three years and which has had some positive results, which has made our actions more coherent and effective and interinstitutional cooperation more positive and which has ensured that the European Commission’s right to initiative, which is one of its prerogatives, is not inconsistent with listening to the demands and sensitivities of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that on 25 February last we presented a document in plenary on the political strategy for 2005 which had been approved that same day by the College of Commissioners. Naturally, we approached the broad political priorities for next year with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the enlarged Europe, relaunching growth and improving competitiveness, in other words, the Lisbon strategy as a whole, promoting and protecting European citizenship and creating a circle of prosperity and stability together with our neighbour countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that 2004 is a special year, with a new Parliament, and the current Commission will shortly be replaced with a new one. Our <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> over recent years for establishing and promoting this structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission has been modified and simplified in certain respects. In this regard, there was a meeting between the Commission and the Conference of Committee Chairmen on 20 April in which we held a very positive exchange of views and which replaced the debates with the different committees. Subsequently, we have followed very closely the work of those parliamentary committees and the various resolutions approved by this House over recent months, in particular in relation to the budgets for 2005 and the Commission’s annual political strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have held debates with the Council, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee on our proposals and they have all contributed their point of view. What we have to do today is assess the results of this dialogue and point out that, in principle, this Parliament has reacted favourably to our broad proposals from an outgoing Commission which – I would emphasise – is passing the baton on to a new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of our priorities for 2005 are competitiveness and cohesion in an enlarged Europe. In this regard, we would like to thank Parliament for its support for our intention to move towards genuine application of the Lisbon strategy by concentrating efforts on achieving fundamental objectives and supporting common policies, including the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The consolidation of the European economy will continue to rest on a healthy macroeconomic policy geared towards stability and based on sustainable public finances, particularly in view of our demographic forecasts. The basic factors will be an integrated strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and structural reforms, promoting the knowledge-based economy and ensuring that the economic, employment, social, environmental and structural policies of the European Union and the Member States operate efficiently and coherently while maintaining the competitiveness of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also pointed out the need decisively to support initiatives aimed at sustainable development and to increase coherence between industrial policy and other Community policies. Specifically, I am also delighted to tell the European Parliament that, in various areas of my responsibility, we have made progress in this direction of openness and competitiveness. Hence, since 1 July 2004, the electricity market has been a reality for non-domestic consumers and in March 2004 the Commission adopted an extremely important liberalisation package in relation to the railways. The latter constitutes a decisive step towards creating a completely integrated European railways market by 2010, which is essential to the competitiveness and sustainability of our transport system and all of this by means of the gradual opening up of the passenger rail market.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to go into issues which you have already supported and approved during 2004, such as the networks, the implementation of the single sky or the measures to be adopted on GALILEO before the end of the year relating to the decision on the group chosen for constructing and managing GALILEO.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great priority is security and European citizenship. The Commission has noted the increasing interest on the part of this Parliament and the Council in enhancing European action in the field of security, particularly through strengthening controls on the external borders of the enlarged European Union, through better management of migratory flows, and Parliament has also expressed its concern – of course – to increase the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism at European level. These are extremely sensitive issues for the citizens and relate to the creation of the area of common justice and security.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, the Commission made an assessment of the progress made since the Tampere European Council in 1999, and following the reactions of all the institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Commission will carry on with its work in the field of justice and home affairs. In 2005, the new multi-annual justice and home affairs programme will be launched – which we hope will be supported by the European Council of 5 November – as well as new support measures within the context of the next financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist attacks in Madrid were a dramatic reminder of the threat of international terrorism facing the European Union and have made the essential need to combat it more obvious than ever. All the institutions, and the European Parliament in particular, have emphasised their desire to move ahead with this fight. Just this morning, President Borrell spoke about this key issue; and all of this, as Mr Poettering said in his speech, without prejudice to human rights, to individual rights and to the objective and will to support the victims of terrorism, an essential element in this fight. The Commission intends to continue working in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element is our external responsibilities and, in particular, the policy of association and neighbourhood. We have just held a debate on Belarus, but it should be pointed out that the Commission has noted broad support for an ambitious policy of neighbourhood and has expressed its opinions in that regard in the Communication of 12 May 2004 which was approved by the European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the enlargement process, the Commission can confirm that it is working towards the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007. On the basis of the European Council’s decision in June, the Commission will begin an active phase of negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of 2005 and will produce a pre-accession strategy. In October, the Commission will publish its recommendation on Turkey and will have to adjust its activities in 2005 in accordance with the decision of the European Council scheduled for the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council and Parliament have stressed, Europe’s international commitments must be maintained during 2005 and Europe must show greater responsibility in order to promote effective multilateralism. The multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the Doha programme for development remain the European Union’s main commercial priority, and at the same time we shall continue with the regional and bilateral negotiations under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to comment briefly on two issues which are particularly important for next year. Firstly, the future financial perspectives, whose priorities largely coincide with the priorities proposed for 2005. The Commission is aware of the importance of doing whatever is necessary to ensure that everything is ready on 1 January 2007 and to this end the current Commission has presented proposals this year, in particular in February and July, and intends to present a new package of measures which will be adopted on 29 September with regard to the aspects of JHA, RELEX and the environment which remain outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 will be fundamental and essential in terms of moving forward with preparing for close interinstitutional cooperation, but, furthermore, it is essential that these financial perspectives can be adopted as soon as possible during 2005 or very early 2006 if we really want them to be effective in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the Commission's proposal in this field takes account, on the one hand, of the austerity required, for example, by the Stability and Growth Pact in all public finances, but also realism with regard to the political ambitions repeatedly expressed not just by the Council but also by this Parliament. Increasing our capacities with regard to protecting external borders means more European Union investment in this sector, which will perhaps allow for greater facilities in certain States. If we truly wish to promote a competitive and dynamic society, we must increase investments in the research and development sector in order to support European research and capacity for innovation, and that requires more funds for that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we cannot forget that one of the objectives of European policy is the cohesion policy. We cannot call for this policy if we do not provide the necessary funds. We believe that what has been proposed, which is to keep 1.24 as the ceiling for commitments and establish 1.14 as the ceiling for spending, represents an appropriate balance between austerity and realism. Any additional cut would be extremely negative and would mean giving up many of the policies being called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the second point I wish to stress is that of the impact assessments relating to the Commission’s proposals. The Commission is implementing and generalising the use of these assessments in order to better define and justify its proposals. In 2004, the Commission’s services gradually increased the use of impact assessments with the aim of making them common practice by 2005, applied to all main documents – political definitions, legislative documents – as well as all proposals with significant economic, social or environmental impact, points which are included in the working programme and the legislative programme of the Commission and which are of great importance to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In February, at the time of the presentation, I emphasised that it was a complex proposal and a complex procedure, because this Commission is passing the baton on to the next one. When the Prodi Commission established the cycle of strategic planning and programming, he wanted to involve the other institutions. Today, at the end of his mandate, I am delighted to note, as the Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Parliament, that the results are very positive. The interinstitutional dialogue has contributed to promoting greater mutual understanding and developing a shared vision which allows us to direct our policies more effectively. I hope that the future Commission will draw what it considers to be the appropriate conclusions and that, where necessary, it will propose revisions of the current procedures which make the methods approved during this time even more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
