<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEPs for making this report possible, as Parliament's views were not sought. Fortunately, however, Parliament did not see any reason why it, as a European political forum, should not give them. Following an initiative by Mr Cappato, which was backed by 108 MEPs, Parliament opted to let the Member States and the representatives of the European Union know its opinion as to what the efforts should be for the United Nations Ministerial Conference taking place next week in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an important conference. It will discuss strategies for, and progress achieved in, vigorously combating all drug abuse. It is really very strange, therefore, that the efforts of governments have not been the subject of intense debate in the national parliaments. The zero tolerance approach that emerges from the three relevant UN conventions is not undisputed, after all. The conventions date from 1961, 1971 and 1988. In 2003, however, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is making known that virtually all of the Member States of the EU have developed alternative strategies. They are not going for prohibition pure and simple, but are trying to prevent the harm caused by drug abuse with the use of clever methods. I think that this is at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Different drugs have different groups of users. A heroin addict, for example, often seeks oblivion, being unable to cope with life. Someone who smokes a joint, on the other hand, is not usually a desperado. You or I may have a glass of wine with our meal tonight, while many young people use the second most popular stimulant in Europe: cannabis. Ecstasy users are a different group entirely. That little tablet forms part of a specific youth culture, whose motto is that it is nice to let your hair down at the weekend, as long as you are up early again on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is, therefore, that lumping all drugs and drugs users together will not provide a solution. Furthermore, I am convinced that stricter prohibitions will actually increase the influence of organised crime. For example, it is true that the Netherlands is an exporter of Ecstasy, but it only became so after the Dutch Government started to crack down on it, and, as a result, it fell into the hands of the hardened criminals of the ‘amphetamines mafia’. The Netherlands was rather too small a market for their liking, so they went on to export it.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that not everyone in Parliament will subscribe to my analysis. How to deal with drug abuse and how to fight organised crime are topics for political debate. This debate should not just be based on ideology and pipe dreams, however, but on reality: how to deal with reality; the diverse realities. I have opted, as a rapporteur, to put down on paper a recommendation that will help that political debate, in particular, on its way. It was not my intention to come up with a position on the best method for combating drug abuse. Instead, I opted – and this has the support of a majority in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – to argue in favour of a careful evaluation of the effectiveness of the UN Conventions on drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to the opponents of my report – and here I am looking at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in particular – that calling for evaluation does not automatically entail a change in the UN Conventions. We do, however, have to be prepared to have a good look at those Conventions. Those who are convinced that a repressive approach really does have such a tremendous effect do not have anything to fear, either, because they no doubt think that zero tolerance will be the outcome of this evaluation and that that will also be the recommendation that is made. I do not think that that is the solution, but an evaluation will in any case be able to shed some light on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In debates I have been accused of extremism, and I fully accept that description when it comes to my own ideas on dealing with drug abuse. We are after all talking about a debate on an important topic, and you can think what you will about my views. I do not, however, accept that label with regard to this report; as the essence of this report is a rational recommendation, an evaluation. It is an evaluation followed by a conference of the United Nations in 2004 to discuss the conclusions resulting from it. It is a limited recommendation, therefore, and I hope that you can see your way to supporting it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the classification of drugs. The evaluation will of course be important in the long-term, and in the short-term it is important that we now agree on a reclassification of drugs. After all, cannabis and heroin are currently in the same category, and I really think that we can agree that the use of heroin does more harm than smoking a joint. I propose therefore reiterating, as a Parliament, what we decided two months ago – in the Malliori report on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence – and requesting that drugs be classified according to the scientific evidence of risk to human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As happened at the meeting of the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to drugs in June 1998, Parliament and the Commission will take part in the Community delegation to go to Vienna in April. The Commission is delighted at the presence of four European Parliament representatives at the meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as well as in the ministerial segment. As you must already know, Parliament, together with the Commission, will make up the delegation from the Community, which has observer status with the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that the Community is not party to the 1961 and 1971 Conventions and is party only to the 1988 Convention but, in this case, with its mandate restricted to the question of chemical precursors. For my part, I should like to reiterate to the House that not just the Commission but the Union as a whole upholds the importance of evaluating the strategies that have been followed in relation to drugs. Last November the Commission carried out an interim evaluation of the European Union’s 2000-2004 drugs action plan, the results of which we intend to present at the Vienna meeting. We are therefore pleased that the United Nations has commenced a similar evaluation process and we hope that the conclusions on the evaluation of the European Union’s action plan and the United Nations’ own conclusions can reinforce each other and provide a clearer clarification of the issues at stake in the implementation of the relevant conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, anyone skimming through Mrs Buitenweg’s report and listening to her statement might think that these proposals of hers are actually quite straightforward and thoroughly acceptable. This is a shrewd piece of work. Let me warn you very strongly, however, against supporting it. You need only read the last section of this report, in which Mrs Buitenweg says quite openly in her explanatory statement that cannabis should purely and simply be deleted from the list of internationally controlled substances. In other words, she is calling from the outset for an amendment of the Single Convention of 1961 and for the deletion of cannabis from the list of prohibited products.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I wish to warn you categorically against backing Mrs Buitenweg’s proposals is that your vote for this report is a vote in favour of freely available drugs and against the health and future of our young people and our society. If you back Mrs Buitenweg, your support will help drug dealers to extend their massive business operations to Europe, and it will damage the programme established by the United Nations with a view to helping farmers to switch to alternative crops and to make a profit from them, because you will be opening a new market for drugs in Europe. And you will ultimately be guaranteeing the proliferation of drugs instead of waging all-out war against them, which ought to be our aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – and I say this here as their spokesman – are resolutely opposed to the free availability of cannabis. We support the preservation of the UN Single Convention. What we advocate is the full application of this Convention, not its amendment. We are in favour of the full entry into force of the programme produced by the European Union, involving simultaneous measures of prevention, suppression and reintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we in favour of this approach, and why do we oppose the free availability of narcotic drugs? It is fairly simple: consider, if you would, the horrific situation in the European Union, where one third of our young people have already tried cannabis. Almost 8% of 15- to 19-year-olds smoke pot daily, and 75% of young people think that cannabis is harmless, even though several studies produced by the medical profession indicate conclusively that the use of cannabis poses physical and, more especially, psychological risks and that it leads to addiction. In short, there is absolutely no reason to liberalise the sale and use of any narcotic drugs, including cannabis, or to remove cannabis from the list of prohibited substances. On the contrary, anyone who knows how much harm drugs can inflict on young people will agree that zero tolerance of drugs is the only answer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we are demanding as an alternative to the proposals contained in this report, and we hope that a majority of the House will support us in tomorrow’s vote, because we want to protect our young people, and for their sake we are resolutely opposed to any amendment of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. This is why we hope that common sense will prevail in the European Parliament and that we can take this common sense majority view to the Vienna conference in order to reinforce the United Nations in its efforts to combat narcotic drugs and to make it clear to the UN that we support the preservation of the Single Convention and that we shall do our utmost to oppose any liberalisation and legalisation of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, unless radical changes are made to the Buitenweg report, we shall certainly be unable to give it our approval.</p>

As far as I am concerned, I first wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, on her report, which, contrary to what has just been said, is well balanced. I have witnessed the fact that this was not easy, given the particularly animated debates which the issue aroused when it was considered by our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Buitenweg pointed out, it really is necessary to take stock of the effectiveness of the existing conventions and also the appropriateness of reclassifying narcotic drugs. By way of an example, I would point out that Article 3 of the Single Convention classifies over 100 substances into four tables, the first of which groups opium, heroin, cocaine, cannabis and methadone in the same category. Is this really logical? I would put this question to Mr Pirker.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be said that the Buitenweg report in no way seeks to make short work of the issue of decriminalising drugs, even soft drugs, but addresses solely and exclusively two issues: the effectiveness and relevance of the current system and the need to reclassify substances. Nevertheless, reclassification of substances on no account means proposing the non-prescription sale of cannabis or its further legalisation. I defy Mr Pirker to demonstrate to the House that this is one of the proposals in Mrs Buitenweg’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would equally point out, that two months ago, this very institution adopted the Malliori report, which specifically said that drugs should be classified on a scientific basis, according to their health risks. Mrs Buitenweg, moreover, expressly referred to this document and I fully support her here today. Are we going to continue to refer to conventions, the first of which dates back to 1961 and the most recent to1988? We feel that the time has come to evaluate these instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the report is well balanced, that it makes ample and meticulous reference to the risks of drug addiction and that on no account does it encourage the use of narcotic drugs. On this point, I again defy Mr Pirker and some of his fellow members in the PPE-DE Group to find any paragraphs containing the slightest encouragement for drug addicts. Under no circumstances does this report seek to minimise the risks associated with drugs and the harm they cause and, in my opinion, there are no grounds for specifically upsetting the balance in Mrs Buitenweg’s report which it was difficult but right to obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we can achieve the broadest support possible for this report, in order to make real headway in our common desire to repair the damage caused by drug addiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that Mrs Buitenweg’s report takes a pragmatic approach, and I fully share this view. I have had an absence of approximately three years from this Parliament, and I am extremely surprised at the stormy, heated debates on this report – even within my own group, I have to say in fairness. After all, we are only talking about an evaluation and a reassessment of the agreements made in the past. I cannot imagine, therefore, why we should not be in favour of it. These are all people who consider it perfectly normal to send their car for inspection after a number of years, and they cannot comprehend why an evaluation should take place here after a period of over thirty years, and conclusions be drawn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this actually all about, Mr President? It is about us all wanting to curb the production, traffic in and abuse of drugs, in particular the abuse of extremely harmful drugs. No one voting in favour of Mrs Buitenweg’s report is intending to offer up children to any kind of drug abuse. The only question that we must answer together is: what is the best method? I cannot do that. If I could – off the cuff, as it were – as Mr Pirker can, it would be very convenient, and I would probably be very rich, as I would have found a solution to a global problem. I must honestly admit that I cannot. I do think, however, that those who can – who can carry out an evaluation on the basis of global data – should be free to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I also wish to argue once more in favour of uniform statistics. Anyone who immerses himself in this problem cannot escape the conclusion that very few statistics exist that are comparable. I am of the opinion that one should only venture to propose changes to the policy on the basis of correct, clear data.</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that an evaluation of the current policy will mean confirming this policy, purely for want of a better solution. I am not advocating this, nor do I expect it, but it is a possible outcome of this report. I do not understand, then, why so many amendments aiming to prevent the evaluation have been tabled. I should like, therefore, to ask those Members calling for others to vote against the Buitenweg report, or in any case the parts of it regarding the evaluation, to have another good think about what is really the best way now to solve the serious drugs problem together. Burying one's head in the sand and pretending the problem does not exist is not the right way. Daring to carry out an evaluation together, on the basis of correct data – that, in my opinion, is the right way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are few people, if any, in Europe who do not know somebody – a family member, a neighbour, a friend, a workmate, someone close, an acquaintance – who has been through the experience of taking and being dependent on drugs, with the effects that has in terms of personal and social dysfunction, human degradation, deteriorating health, poverty and, all too often, crime and death.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the fight against drugs is still a touchstone of public policy today; for any government, for any responsible state, now is not the time to scale down this fight. The three United Nations Conventions that are the backcloth to the resolution we are debating today and will vote on tomorrow take centre stage in this. They represent the highest point in a position that nobody can deny: the drug strategy will only be 100% successful one day if it is carried on in an organised way, at a truly global international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1998 action plan of the United Nations General Assembly is another step in that direction, and we have now reached mid-term in the ten-year evaluation period defined at that time. Well, the problem is still so serious internationally that this is not the time to weaken that position or any of its instruments. In recent years it has become fashionable in some quarters to say that prohibition policies, lumped together as ‘prohibition’, have suffered continual failures and that these failures are recognised by the authorities themselves. This is not true! Above all, the push towards liberalisation that people are trying to extract from this is not right either.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, finding areas or levels of relative lack of success does not wipe out the successes achieved or the crucial importance of the international prohibition framework that has been adopted as a global security network; secondly, finding areas of lack of success because we want to improve efficiency levels is not the same as publicising failures in order to inspire and nurture a surrender to this global threat; and thirdly, detecting any failure is therefore only useful if it comes with a serious diagnosis of its causes, so as to strengthen resolve even further at the next stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not difficult to recognise, then, that the main reason why we cannot yet claim a 100% success rate in the fight against drugs, along the lines set by these three conventions, is that this fight is still not really being conducted in a truly international framework. There are still countries that either openly or subtly operate outside the rules. There are many who put more effort into discovering loopholes and omissions in the framework of the conventions or making new ones than in trying to implement them properly. This report, or rather its explanatory statement, is a good example of just that. There are still countries even in the European Union, such as the Netherlands, for instance, which are trying out policies in a different direction, and one might even wonder whether this calls into question the common security framework in the Schengen area. There are still territories outside the control of state authorities where criminal gangs openly defy international authority. There are still other territories and areas of activity of many different kinds on which many countries take only a weak stand, that is if they do not deliberately turn a blind eye to the illicit goings-on. These are the weaknesses on which we must focus our attention in the run-up to the Vienna meeting on 16 and 17 April. As an informed, responsible Parliament, we must not send the Union’s representatives at this meeting a single wrong sign, a single sign of weakness, a single sign of giving up.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution got off to a bad start. It started with an initiative that in its entirety openly challenges the United Nations conventions and their framework, although it then tries to circumscribe its aims. Next, Mrs Buitenweg tried hard to constrain its content, but she did not erase the original wrong direction taken by the initiative or its risks. Afterwards, during the debates in committee, there were efforts to reconcile different viewpoints and limit areas of disagreement but, despite these efforts, the matter is so sensitive that, as representative of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I decided to propose an alternative resolution that could give us absolute political certainty. It is for this proposal that I ask for the House’s support. Any ambiguity in this field will lead to disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so far as Commissioner Vitorino agrees with Mrs Buitenweg’s approach, I also have a fundamental difference of opinion with him.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Ministerial Conference on drugs is approaching rapidly; or rather, it is starting today, and goes on until 17 April. I have followed with growing astonishment the activities of the anti-prohibitionists over recent months. It is actually quite clever how they manage to turn up in all the places that matter. Their presentation of the free-thinking attitude to drugs almost makes you doubt. ‘It is a good thing to prioritise the health of addicts.’ ‘It is pitiful that hard drugs have to be bought on the illegal circuit.’ ‘It is their choice whether they take drugs in prison.’ I could almost believe it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, many do not, in spite of the intensive lobby. The anti-prohibitionist lobby has to suffer some heavy blows. Who is not yet familiar with the scandal surrounding Mike Trace? He had to bid farewell to his jobs with the United Nations and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction when his free-thinking intentions became known. The conference on drugs organised by the Greek Presidency turned out to be a fiasco for the anti-prohibitionists. The Member States refused to make a declaration pushing, among other things, for an amendment of the UN conventions. The matter has now arrived, unbidden, at Parliament's door.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of the Buitenweg report is clear. Although it is not stated in concrete terms, it is insinuated that an amendment of the UN conventions is becoming inevitable in view of the failure of the policy conducted up to now. The free-thinking policy is supposed to lead to undeniable successes. This is a mistaken conclusion, as far as I am concerned. As a fellow citizen of the Netherlands, I am familiar with the pros and cons of our policy. We offer good care for addicts, and we have developed many good initiatives as regards demand, but that is where it ends. Harm reduction alone is not a solution. It implies accepting drug addiction as a social phenomenon and looking on while fellow human beings are destroyed. It is true that we are helping them by providing clean syringes and good user rooms, but the destruction continues. Kicking the habit, if need be with the use of strong pressure, is still the best way of protecting the health of drug addicts. We take the same approach to tobacco addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Netherlands, thanks to our policy, now have fewer drug addicts than other countries? The answer is ‘no’; it has at least as many. Harm reduction has a role to play in dealing with the drugs problem, but, contrary to what the report suggests, it is never an alternative to combating drug trafficking and drug addiction. In addition, it certainly should not be a veiled argument for voting in favour of amending the UN conventions, because the amendments the anti-prohibitionists want go much further than that. The old chestnut of harm reduction is only the pebble that sets the landslide rolling. Their aim is to do away with the present UN Conventions and legalise drugs. Meanwhile, the destruction of lives goes on. As is evident from the 14 amendments I tabled, I do not support in any way, shape or form this ambiguous report. Voting it down and quickly forgetting about it is the best option, as far as I am concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cappato (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, there are some Members who have decided to speak not on the Buitenweg report but on motives or on the recommendation on which it is based. These Members like to try and divide the House into those who are against drugs, meaning themselves, those who are for our children and young people, meaning themselves, and those who are for drugs and have got it in for all our children.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it must be said that, today, drugs are your drugs; they are free: free to be controlled by the Mafia and organised crime, free to kill with overdoses, free to kill with Aids, free to kill in the streets and squares of our towns. If anything, we antiprohibitionists are against your free, criminal drugs; we are in favour of control, we are in favour of the law and observance of the law. We are in favour of treating drug-takers – whether they take legal or illegal drugs – as consumers, in some cases as sick people, but not as criminals. We do not understand how your preventive measures can be applied to people who are treated as criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to say that, today, the European Parliament is called upon to debate that which falls within its remit: not the issue of free, legal, prohibited drugs, therefore, but the evaluation and possible reform of the current policies. This is what you must debate, and you are refusing to do it. In 1998, under your international Conventions, the United Nations decided to launch a ten-year plan – 1998-2008 – to rid the world of drugs. ‘<span class="italic">A drug-free world: we can do it</span>.’ This was the great slogan. All sorts of things were tried, even financial agreements with the Taliban – European funding was given to the Taliban regime before September 11 to pay for the eradication of the opium plantations. We paid for the fumigation of Andean valleys in South America. We paid for helicopters and armies. We paid for the militarisation of our society. Five years on, the result is an increase in drug consumption and production and the diversification of the market. Increasing amounts of increasingly dangerous drugs are being produced with new molecules and new substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, five years later, we are debating the situation as it stands, not expressing ideological points of view. What we are calling for, what the Buitenweg report is calling for, is an evaluation of the results. If our policies had been applied by those in power, I think we would be willing to agree to such an evaluation now. We do not understand why you are against it: when there is ideology, when the individual moral code of any one of us – and I do not consider mine to be necessarily any worse than yours – becomes a State moral code, then we are building an ethical State, and applying prohibition to drugs leads to it being applied to debates and to science, with the result that cannabis and the coca leaf are treated in the same way as heroin. I would like to see you accept this equation of cannabis with heroin if it was your son or your daughter who was smoking cannabis or using heroin.</p>
<p class="contents">I could continue but I have run out of time. I hope that the Members of all the political parties will, at least, take up the challenge to debate and evaluate the situation rather than hold forth on ideological views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report states a basic position. It is not a response to the current situation, as some would have us believe. In actual fact, for many years, the UN has been maintaining a position against drug producers and pushers, clearly indicating the degree to which the different substances are dangerous and vehemently upholding the need to combat illegal trafficking and the spread of crime at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">After the 1961 UN Convention, there were further declarations: in 1971, 1988 and 1998. Now, in view of the Ministerial Conference due to take place next week in Vienna, the European Parliament is being called upon to present a proposal, to express its position. That is no easy task, given what we have just heard. Although it takes these broad premises as a starting point and appears to be well balanced, the report then comes more or less directly to the usual conclusions which regularly divide Parliament and public opinion too – that soft drugs, particularly cannabis, should be liberalised and legalised and that a distinction should be made between soft and hard drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the Members asked just now how the report could be interpreted in that way, but the points are there if one reads the report carefully. Moreover, the method of treatment using alternative substances is clearly recommended as the most effective system, the most direct way of combating drug addiction. Here too, nothing could be further from the truth. As we are aware, this method is disputed in many Member States because it does not bring about the recovery of drug addicts but just stops them being a threat to society. In other words, the important thing is to remove the problem – this kind of method is not really intended to bring about the recovery of the individuals concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also appears to be deficient in that it does not combine the proposals for measures in the current situation with pre-emptive initiatives to limit the phenomenon in the future. In any case, the attempt to liberalise cannabis as a non-dangerous substance is unacceptable in that there is no scientific evidence to this effect. Although it may be true – and here I am opening a window for those who hold a different view – that not all those who start by smoking cannabis go on to take hard drugs, it is now an established fact that all those who are now slaves to heroine started by smoking pot or grass.</p>
<p class="contents">These different opinions have already emerged, during the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and it is no coincidence that this report was adopted by 24 votes to 20.</p>
<p class="contents">The documentation is clear for the most part, then, confirming how difficult it is in this matter to proclaim absolute truths or to provide conclusive, unquestionable solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">She has had a very difficult task; getting a consensus on this issue is impossible. However, to get a good majority, I believe, is possible. That majority will largely reflect the views of the people across the European Union. No-one would argue with the fact that we need to seek to reduce the devastating consequences of drug abuse for drug abusers, their families and society as a whole. There is nothing in the report that is contrary to that. We have heard some amazing things from Mr Pirker, Mr Santini, Mr Blokland and others which make one wonder how they chose to interpret the remarks in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pirker, you said a few minutes ago that if you voted in favour of this report, you would be against the health of our young people. Furthermore you said that if you voted in favour of this report you would be helping drug dealers. Really, if you read that into this report, I suggest that you go back and have another read of it. Moreover, if you want your group – the PPE-DE Group – to take that line, I must tell you that it is not just a simplification of the situation, it is a distortion, a gross misrepresentation of what is in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">People have spoken about zero tolerance. There is absolutely no evidence that zero tolerance is a serious, effective, or even practical policy to follow when we are trying to address this issue. You only have to look at history, at Prohibition in the USA, when there was zero tolerance of alcohol: what a wonderful success that was in solving all the problems they had in the United States! It will not work. There is no evidence to support zero tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak when she said that no-one knows the real answer. There is no easy solution. But I believe that in voting for this report we are not saying that the conventions have to be changed but that there is room for an in-depth evaluation. That is why I will be voting for it: to be realistic, to accept society as it is; to be modernistic in our approach; and to be outward-looking. Yes, Mr Pirker, I am looking at the same report as you. We must be outward-looking in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, you need to know that there are two clear policies in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. There is a limit to compromise, and one that Mrs Buitenweg has grossly exceeded. There is no reason whatsoever for demanding changes or a review of the UN conventions on drugs. It is not the conventions that are at fault. Instead, it is unwillingness on the part of the Member States to get to grips with increasing drug problems.</p>
<p class="contents">To those fellow MEPs – and there are some even in my own group – who say that I am inflexible and do not appreciate the importance of changes, I would say that, inflexible I may be, but I am also aware of what is behind this resolution. This is, of course, emphatically about politics, Mr Evans. You do not need to be Einstein to appreciate that. A visit the other day to the red-light district in Amsterdam convinced me even more, for it is a fact, Mr Evans, that those who are keen to review the UN conventions are the same persons who want to legalise and liberalise drugs policy. Mr Cappato’s rhetoric does not therefore ring in the least bit true. We know what he is after. We also know what Mrs Buitenweg wants, namely to legalise both soft and hard drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not forget that those of us here in this Chamber are the representatives of millions of Europeans. More than a million people have signed what is termed the Vienna Declaration, rejecting any undermining of the UN conventions. Ladies and gentlemen, the signals we must send to Vienna and to all the young people of Europe, including those sitting here and applauding, are: no, we do not want legalisation; no, we do not want liberalisation. No we have not given up the fight for a drugs-free Europe. You should reject the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attempts by governments to suppress the use of certain drugs are as old as their failure. Against this, let me put to you the liberal idea, which certainly does not represent a particularly strong attack on the power of the state, that there are things which are simply no concern of government, such as the flavour of jam people like to eat, how many layers of clothing they wear in winter or which narcotic substance they like to smoke, sniff, drink or inject.</p>
<p class="contents">Government efforts to regulate individual consumption, indeed, have serious consequences, for it is a fact that the 2 000 heroin users who die a wretched death each year in Germany alone are not destroyed by the drug itself but by the conditions in which the state compels them to use it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us today scarcely touches on this point. A policy on narcotic drugs needs to be a humanist policy, which means for example that drugs should be assessed on the basis of their actual effects on the human body; in other words, impact should take precedence over legality. In practice, however, government policies on narcotic drugs have nothing to do with humanism but much to do with the creation of a governed nation and with the productivity of the national population.</p>
<p class="contents">Any humanist – and let me say to my radical and less radical fellow Members that I have absolutely no intention of triggering a Marxist critique of the role of the state in this case – will agree that it is essential to reject any type of official policy on drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Drugs are, indeed, a problem threatening citizens’ health, security and quality of life, and that is why the European Parliament has committed itself to finding an effective solution to the drugs problem, which is a problem common to all countries and all social groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The three conventions governing the narcotics issue have already been mentioned here: the 1961 one on narcotics, the 1971 one on psychotropic substances and the 1988 Vienna Convention against the illicit traffic in these substances. These three conventions prohibit the production, traffic, sale and consumption of a wide range of substances for other than medical or scientific purposes. The proposal of the rapporteur, Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg, is basically to amend the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs through a reclassification of the scheduled substances. What the rapporteur wants – and she does not hide this – is to change the list of prohibited substances so that cannabis can be removed from this list, which, whether you like it or not, will lead to the legalisation of trade in this drug.</p>
<p class="contents">It is laudable that the Member States that are signatories to these conventions should meet, as will happen on 16 and 17 April, as the Commissioner has reminded us, in order to evaluate the progress made and the difficulties encountered and to debate whether there is a need to introduce changes. In this process, new strategies in the fight against drugs or the reinforcement of existing ones will always be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">When, however, this report proposes a reclassification of the scheduled substances, it is trying to push for a liberalisation of the consumption of certain drugs. This is something I cannot accept. I do not believe that supporting a movement to liberalise drugs can or should be the solution for an effective fight against the growing drug problem. I consider it unacceptable that one should wish to put out the idea that the European Union agrees with the liberalisation of drugs when this is contrary to the strategy that has been followed in almost all the Member States. We have to observe the existing conventions and strengthen the means for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts; we have to observe the principle of subsidiarity, given that there are different drugs policies in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by recalling that last month in this House we approved a report by Mr Pirker on the problem of the accelerating growth in the production of and trade in synthetic drugs, which approved extending the ban to substances which at the moment are not scheduled. Nobody in the Europe in which we live would understand if we took a different approach today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But let us be clear: are we not today acknowledging the failures of these three international conventions, the first of which is 40 years old? Are we not saying, today, that everything that we have done in terms of prohibition is meaningless? The major international meeting this April will decide to launch an evaluation of these conventions. This could be an opportunity to open a broad debate on the matter. The report we have here has considerable impact. It shows, for once, that we have reached a state of maturity and responsibility. It proposes, with reasoning based on pure good sense, an essential evaluation in order to put an end to the state of delirium or – dare I say it – the obscurantism which inspire certain individuals when discussing drug addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Talk of an evaluation and a review is not proselytism. We must conclude that the conventions are repressive, when we have just voted for a document which calls on us to move towards prevention and take more pragmatic steps. It is clear that the classification system which currently regulates various drugs is totally obsolete. How can we be endangered by a scientific re-evaluation carried out on the fundamental basis of the criterion of danger to health and society? Are the opponents of this measure, the defenders of zero-tolerance convinced so little by their arguments that they are coming to fear a simple evaluation?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, that is, there is a genuine failure of all the policies we have developed; we should take the time to carry out these evaluations; we should put a stop to the stupid obscurantism which places cannabis and heroin on the same level. It is time to remember that the Member States are the ones which organise, ratify and write these conventions and that they may have now decided to reach a political position which is certainly more logical, coordinated and above all, more responsible in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eighteen months after they bombed hell out of Afghanistan, the heroin crop in that country is now greater than ever. What a brilliant strategy the Americans must have!</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to find anyone who believes that the existing drugs policies are a success. It would be a ridiculous claim to make, were they to do so. So it should simply be common sense to evaluate current policies, assess their effectiveness and consider alternative options. And common sense it might be to the majority of people; but not, I fear, to the delegates to this convention. They might as well all be in the pay of the drug barons, because the effect of their determination to pursue the policies of prohibition will simply be to line the pockets of those same criminals, discarding more intelligent approaches which could reduce the real harm to individuals and to the rest of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that prohibition is not the solution to the problems, it is the principal cause of them. It is prohibition which creates the profits of the drug barons. It is prohibition which kills users by denying them the information they need about the drugs they put into their bodies. It is prohibition which feeds the cancer of corruption which does so much harm to our society.</p>
<p class="contents">My view – and my hope – is that prohibition will one day be replaced by government regulation; but I do not say that this is a policy which should be imposed on every nation. I say to my Swedish colleagues and to the United States that they should be free to develop the drugs policies they think appropriate for their own nations, but that others should be free to develop their own strategies to explore more effective solutions to deal with this terribly difficult problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not one reference to the social causes of drug addiction, to prevention or to rehabilitation. The UN studies into the negative consequences of legalisation and prescribing substitutes are dismissed and the report even doubts their harmfulness by proposing classification, but with a call for new studies into their consequences. Mr Cappato even goes so far as to maintain that it is not drugs but the illicit nature of their use which is to blame for the marginalisation of drug addicts. Even more outrageous is the allegation that prohibition is to blame for the increase in the use of drugs. Thus he exonerates the dealers and capitalist society and condemns young people.</p>

The targets were to do with reduction of use, sale, production, and so on. Those are good targets, and so it is great that Mrs Buitenweg has drawn up a report about them, to give the delegation a couple of recommendations. However, her intentions do not, of course, stop there. As a true politician, she also wants to give some guidance. Her report is cleverly formulated, but is in my opinion based on an erroneous point of view. That is why I am somewhat critical of it.</p>
<p class="contents">To my way of thinking, Paragraph 7 is the key section. When it comes to evaluations, criteria have to be laid down. Those are broadly outlined in Paragraph 7; <span class="italic">very</span> broadly, as I think that they all deserve to be specified in greater detail. I take the view that scientific research in this field is in any case very difficult, and that it has to be prepared very carefully so that the criteria laid down are adhered to at all times during the research. We all know that any scientific study nowadays can be undermined by another scientific study. You can even hire institutions for it, anyway. We should be extremely careful that it is really done properly, therefore, and so we should heed Mr Blokland’s warning about the staff working on it.</p>
<p class="contents">When this issue comes up for discussion, all kinds of emotions are vented. I find that very entertaining to listen to. I have just heard Mr Robert Evans speaking vehemently about these matters. That means that there is some kind of conviction behind his views; either that, or he wishes to project a certain image about himself. I understand that, in the Netherlands, the idea of the autonomy of the individual, who must take central stage, is very important. I do not believe in that position at all. I have a totally different belief in that regard, in that I do not believe that every individual has the right to choose his own addiction – as I have heard proclaimed on Dutch television once or twice. I find it a strange autonomy where surrendering autonomy is actually the highest form of autonomy. I do not think much of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Netherlands has had a rude awakening. Everyone thinks that we have a wonderfully tolerant policy; but we now see it as being very dated, and are looking at other possibilities. We are saying: have we not been much too tolerant? Is that classification of drugs really such a good idea after all? I can tell you, Mr Evans, that the Netherlands is able to grow cannabis that is so good, and so highly concentrated, that the line between this and hard drugs is scarcely perceptible. Therefore, that classification has invalidated itself. In addition, the tolerant climate in the Netherlands – in which large numbers of people do not see themselves as criminals when making ecstasy tablets – has resulted in a production boom, making us, I believe, one of the largest exporters in the world. You could say that this is good for the Dutch economy, but I see that as the wrong way of looking at things. We have to realise that those ecstasy tablets are responsible for a great deal of senseless nightlife violence. I think that we must get away from this, and conduct a more down-to-earth policy along the lines of zero tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To evaluate the policy’s effectiveness is one thing, but to suggest, as this report does, that international conventions that work well should be rescinded is going too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I see any reason for reclassifying preparations, as is also demanded by the report. We must remember that, according to the UN conventions, scientific proofs are now already required before a substance can be used lawfully for medical purposes. I am not therefore in favour of this report as it at present stands.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, in my capacity as a representative of the people, it is important not to give way in the fight against drugs. Sometimes, it is difficult to discuss these issues because, as has been shown in today’s debate, we each have very different views concerning the way in which the available tools are to be used. Allow me to explain my approach and that of the Swedish Social Democrats. We believe that the decriminalisation or legalisation of so-called soft drugs would be downright harmful because soft drugs lead to the use of harder drugs. That is something we know from experience, and I hardly think that anyone here could contradict the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">We support a drugs policy consisting of three parts, each of which is important: firstly, preventive work; secondly, a policy of control; and, thirdly, treatment. The first part, consisting of preventive measures, is the most important, and that is where the emphasis must be. It is therefore not acceptable to tear up our international conventions dedicated to prevention and to promoting a sensible drugs policy. The second part, relating to control, is also important, but it is only one of three parts. Treatment and rehabilitation are obvious elements of any humane and effective drugs policy aimed at ending the demand for drugs, halting their proliferation and preventing drug-related crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the advocates of legalisation are going further and challenging existing international agreements. There is therefore good reason to stand up for what until now has been a wise policy on the part of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg’s report urges a review of the UN conventions and the reclassification of drugs. The long-term aim seems to be a free market for certain drugs and then for all drugs and, subsequently, the decriminalisation of drug misuse. Neither I nor the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can support this. Mrs Buitenweg presents the matter in a very intelligent way. It is only when the explanatory statement is studied that it is apparent that we are in actual fact concerned here with the legalisation of cannabis and that the long-term aim is to legalise all drugs. That is something that is apparent from various passages.</p>
<p class="contents">The tone adopted by those who advocate legislation has changed and become more polished in recent years, giving greater reason for concern. Harm reduction<span class="italic"> </span>sounds innocent enough, as if it meant reducing damage, but, if used wrongly, may conceivably become a tool for those who wish to legalise drugs. We are concerned here not only with methadone and needle exchange programmes but also with what is termed the safer use of drugs, as if there were any such thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The pressure is increasing upon young people and families. It is no wonder that most parents are opposed to the legalisation of cannabis. The best thing society can do to help is not to increase access to drugs of any type. The EU is making important efforts to combat the drugs trade. We must not therefore open the way to further drug trading by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three pieces of advice for the governments and the Commission in the run-up to the Vienna Summit. Firstly, do not touch the UN conventions, but push instead for their being implemented in full by all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let issues of care and treatment remain national competences. On this matter, I am obviously thinking along the same lines as Mr Davies in wanting to respect the Member States’ different experiences and traditions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, an accessible and adequate supply of individually tailored care and rehabilitation services is a better route to countering misuse than the reclassification of different kinds of drugs. Market tools should be used for what there is a real desire to bring about: not more drugs or drug addicts, but more effective care with a view to leaving drug problems behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conference for the mid-term review of the UN action plan to be held in Vienna gives us a chance to hold a scientifically documented debate on the effectiveness of the measures applied to date. The targets set at the session in New York in June 1998 were admittedly rather ambitious. Quite a few points in the plan have been successful, such as a balanced approach between reducing demand and reducing supply and collating statistics so that they are comparable from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN conventions on drugs are an important framework for successful policy. However, they need to be evaluated and updated, taking account of changes which have emerged in the international environment, new data in this specific sector, the effectiveness of pilot programmes and the speed at which new addictive substances are being produced and trafficked. We have a duty to study all this carefully and assess if, in the end, the current conventions are felt to be up-to-date and adequate. Nor should we forget that these conventions were drawn up in 1961, 1971 and 1988.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's recommendation by the European Parliament basically moves in this direction and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur. This recommendation does not come down for or against the legalisation of addictive substances. On the contrary, it calls for our policies on this very difficult issue to be up-to-date, adequate, effective and, most importantly, to prevent the problems, not punish the users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seriously questions the sense of zero tolerance with regard to drugs. The rapporteur must be given credit for having cunningly hidden her real message behind technical nuances of meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">The change to the classification of drugs in the UN Conventions, which is called for in the report, is unnecessary. The entire reclassification is merely a code name to disguise the promotion of a liberal policy on drugs. To put it simply: we are speaking here about legalising the use of cannabis, partially decriminalising the sale of cannabis and its derivatives, and making heroin available under supervision. This I cannot agree to.</p>
<p class="contents">A restrictive drugs policy, in other words zero tolerance, is the only way to adopt a position on drugs. This policy has had good results. In the Nordic countries we have managed to control the drugs problem to a greater extent than elsewhere in Europe. As an example of the results that have been achieved I might mention that there has been a reduction in drug deaths and drug-related crime, and the number of experiments with drugs has levelled off.</p>
<p class="contents">A sad example of a liberal drugs policy is the ‘model country’ for this trend, the Netherlands. According to Europol statistics, more than 50% of the synthetic drugs circulating in Europe are produced in the Netherlands. Just as my colleague, Mr Oostlander, said here earlier on, it is quite clear that drugs and their use proliferate wherever there is a favourable attitude to them.</p>
<p class="contents">As background data, the report uses studies by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. The importance of these studies wanes, however, when one considers the background of this unit’s former director. In January this person had to resign from his post because it became evident that, in addition to his regular duties, he was promoting the legalisation of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of attitude to drugs is one of principle. We politicians have to be conscious of our responsibilities and act in accordance with them. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to think carefully about what sort of message you want to send out in tomorrow’s vote, especially to the young.</p>

<p class="contents">We all know that the overwhelming majority of both petty and organised crime is drug-related. Europe's society cannot continue to tolerate that and to pursue policies that are clearly failing. If anybody imagines that our drug policies are working, then they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. People are dying daily because they are caught up in a drug underworld which is making millions from their misery. I have visited housing estates where grandmothers are rearing grandchildren because the parents have died, not from an overdose of cannabis or even of heroin, but because they used dirty needles to inject themselves with heroin or took impure heroin. We cannot continue to allow our children to be destroyed in this way by the drug underworld.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning in the Irish newspapers there was yet another report of a killing as a result of feuds between drug gangs – the fifth in Ireland alone in the last year. When was the last time a pharmacist shot another pharmacist to control the drugs market in his area? As the drugs market in his area is legal, there is no need for him to go chasing a share of the market illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to review the UN Conventions. A strong call should go from this Parliament tomorrow that the Conventions need to be reviewed and that we need to get serious about how we are handling the drug issue. We need to look in a serious way at the decriminalisation of cannabis, and to get serious about serious drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Will he find the solution in the Netherlands? Is it there that the most helpful models are to be found? Is the Netherlands an example to the rest of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Combating the drugs scourge is far too serious a matter to be left to individuals who are not prepared to take full responsibility on behalf of the present and future generations. My question to many of you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists and to the majority of you in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is this: what support are you prepared to give to the parents of a teenage girl or boy when she or he tells mum and dad that the politicians, in their wisdom, have decriminalised drugs and that society has nothing against drugs. What support do you offer that teenager’s mother, Mr De Rossa and Mr Evans? What support do you offer his or her father, Mr De Rossa and Mr Evans? What message do you have? Is the Dutch model the modern one? Is this the outward-, forward-looking one? There are so many different concepts floating about. Put yourselves in the shoes of a real family, and imagine the message that is being sent out to the children and teenagers.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempts to legalise drugs constitute a serious infringement of the UN Convention on Drugs and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, especially Article 33 of the latter. I quote: ‘States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties, and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances’.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, concerns the way in which she imagines Dutch policy to protect children’s rights and to strengthen the position of Dutch parents in telling their children, both younger and older, to resist drugs, including cannabis. I also wonder in what way the Netherlands is a model for the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans also addresses the issue of whether cannabis can be compared with alcohol. Apparently, the message, especially in Great Britain, is that cannabis should become as culturally accepted as alcohol is at present. Does this mean that you want culturally accepted drug use to extend to include cannabis? Not only do Swedish Christian Democrats reject this view; but so also, tomorrow, will a majority of Members of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the most important areas we need to look at is how best we can create a society in which people are protected from the dangers presented to them. We do that by a series of moves, through legislation and other areas, to ensure that the common good and individual rights are protected. Some of those individual rights and common good goals mean that individual freedom of action and movement is diminished, but the purpose is not to restrict a person from doing something they want to do, but because it is for the greater good to ensure that person cannot do it.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who has worked with young drug addicts and young alcoholics in the past, I know that nothing is more calculated to send out the wrong message than proposals calling for the legalisation of illegal substances. To do so denies the fact that they cause damage. It is ironic that at a time when the European Union and this Parliament are striving to diminish smoking because of its serious health consequences, in another area we are trying to allow people to freely damage their own health with drugs that have been proved to damage health and create other problems. There is a better way to enforce the law, to make it more equitable and to ensure that we can react to the concerns of the individual addicts who want to recover and get treatment. However, the way to do that is not by legalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
