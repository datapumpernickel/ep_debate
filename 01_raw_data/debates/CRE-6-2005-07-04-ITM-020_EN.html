This thematic strategy is the first in a series of seven strategies which represent a new way of preparing coordinated environmental policy. The strategy on air pollution is now in the final stages of preparation, having passed through the extensive consultation procedure in which the European Parliament was actively involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a known fact that air pollution has very harmful consequences on human health: respiratory problems, bronchitis, lung cancer and premature death in both young and elderly people. Nowadays, approximately 350 000 premature deaths a year are linked to air pollution. Even and when the present policies and current legislation have been fully applied, we shall still have over 270 000 premature deaths in 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution has an adverse effect on the environment and on ecosystems. Thus, up to 1 million square kilometres of natural ecosystems will continue to be at serious risk. In short, the damage to health and the environment is so acute – over EUR 200 billion a year in repercussions on health alone – that we need to step up our action. We need to bear in mind that well prepared environmental policies can make a positive contribution to competitiveness and to the creation of high quality jobs. Air pollution has serious adverse financial repercussions. The health problems which it causes and the poor quality of the air that we breathe lead to the loss of 150 000 million working days a year, to losses in productivity and, as a result, to serious health spending. The agricultural sector loses 2.5 billion a year from the damage caused by ozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we forget that the environment is an issue which attracts constant support from European citizens. In addition, European citizens themselves judge that, in the environmental sector, Community action performs better, providing and creating added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Action such as this in connection with air pollution will have direct benefits for European citizens. It will bring about an important improvement in the quality of air that we breathe. It is something we owe European citizens. I trust I can count on your support at this new stage of environmental policy now starting and I hope soon to be able to present the strategy on air pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, all thematic strategies were supposed to come to the European Parliament and Council within three years. Commissioner, the three years are up on 22 July. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we were given a splendid outline on 21 June of which strategies would be coming in which months, all of them by 5 December: one in December, two in November, one in September, two in July, three in June. Five – on air, waste, sustainable use of resources, marine and aviation – would be with us before the summer. Then we were told that we would be starting with air pollution and the marine environment by July. Now we are into July and we have none of them.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been rumours in the media – which we always believe – of dark deeds in the Commission: ‘Barroso mugs Dimas’, we read in the headlines. Then DG Environment confirmed that there had been no withdrawal, but that there was to be an orientation debate. Well, I thought orientation took place before you started on the journey, but apparently the journey has been interrupted while we work out where we are trying to go. If we are to assess compatibility with the Lisbon Agenda, I wonder why that was not done before.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has rightly drawn attention to the problem of air pollution. There are some 370 000 premature and preventable deaths a year from outdoor and indoor, industrial, traffic, farming and dust pollution. Of course there is a cost to be considered, but I think Parliament believes that we should be working on the strategy with the Commission and the Council now and that, at the very least, we need a stated timetable on when each of the thematic strategies is going to come to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Action is really desperately needed. Air quality must improve. The Commission has worked very hard on a sound strategy, but is now, in the final stages, bowing to industry, and its most conservative section at that. The world needs clean technology. The Chinese, Indians and Koreans are also struggling to meet air quality standards. European industry could capitalise on this with a sense of renewal and urge for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Bowes said a moment ago, the environment is an important part of the Lisbon strategy. Environmental innovation helps the European economy move forward, something that the Commission recognised back in February, but which has not, unfortunately, found practical expression. How can the public have confidence in a Commission that refuses to urge polluters to produce in a more environmentally-friendly manner? How can they have confidence in a Europe that tolerates 370 000 premature deaths annually as a result of air pollution? What kind of Europe is it that refuses to take action in order to vastly improve this situation? Is that the Europe that you want?</p>
<p class="contents">To improve air quality is not an easy thing to do. In the Netherlands, it is evident how difficult it is to meet the standards. The Netherlands has made huge efforts, albeit somewhat belatedly, to comply with the European agreements, but it is abundantly clear that, in order to be able to guarantee clean air, measures are needed that get to the root of the problem. We need clean cars, clean diesels, clean production processes, but we also have to conclude, unfortunately, that the internal market rules get in the way of bold policy, and sometimes even make it impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the seriousness of the situation and the Commission’s inability to take action, the interests of public health are so serious that I call on the Member States to set aside the internal market rules. That is not an easy appeal for me to make, for the internal market is very close to my heart, but I am convinced that it is necessary to put public health before the market, certainly now that the Commission refuses to take the lead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This delay goes against what we jointly agreed when we drew up the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. This is something we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution causes illness and kills. According to the latest information, up to 300 000 people a year are killed by just small particles. Right now, in the wake of the French and Dutch referenda, the Commission’s decision is very unfortunate. It will tend to weaken the people’s confidence in the EU even further. Opinion polls show that the public wants special action from the European Union to improve the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">According to press reports, the postponement has been promoted in particular by Commissioners Verheugen and McCreevy. If they and the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, believe environmental protection weakens competitiveness, I would ask them to show us the proof. All the public surveys and the experiences of people that have come to my attention suggest it is just the opposite. Environmental protection promotes competitiveness. Studies of what the environmental protection reforms implemented thus far have cost show that they have all been cheaper than expected. The costs have been four times, and even ten times less than the estimates made beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso is not present, but I would like to remind him, nevertheless, that we also pay a price for inactivity. Merely in terms of medical expenses it costs between 200 and 600 billion euros per annum. The price is also paid in as many as 300 000 untimely deaths every year. These figures are not imaginary: they are actual costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to know when the thematic strategies are to be proposed. The promotion of environmental protection would represent just the sort of leadership that Europe at present sorely needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I, along with my fellow Members, endorse the Commissioner’s analysis of air pollution, I also share Mrs Corbey’s disappointment that the thematic strategy has not yet been published. Our Members now want a date for this publication. I was pleased to read in the newspapers that Commissioner Dimas was furious, but have in this debate noticed very little of it so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you can count on our support provided you persevere and have this thematic strategy published shortly. If the Commission fails to do this, then you have a problem. There is no time to lose now before the introduction. Euro-5 PM two-and-a-half is an exceptionally good strategy and has a place in the thematic strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to regain the confidence of the public, you will need to ensure that you pull out all the stops in order to actually tackle cross-border air pollution and fight it effectively. This can be done by means of this thematic strategy, but we should not wait any longer, get down to brass tacks and persevere. Commissioner, you can count on our support, you have my word on this, but we expect you to make an all-out effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In over 60% of all Europe’s ecosystems, biodiversity is under threat. If nothing is done by 2020, we will see 292 000 premature deaths and over 90 000 admitted to hospital with breathing problems. Moreover, 650 000 square kilometres – an area twenty times the size of Belgium – of Europe’s ecosystem are under threat of azotic pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">You yourself announced to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we could look forward in July to the thematic strategy on air. Your Director-General, Katherine Day, joined us a fortnight ago and told us the same thing, that this thematic strategy would be in place in July. It now appears that industry has gained the upper hand and is trying – I think, blindly – to delay the air strategy. As I see it, we need together to strive towards this particular Lisbon goal in order to make ourselves more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">While stressing, as one must, the need to remain competitive, we cannot forget the need for sustainability, for it is sustainable growth for which Europe is known. In the long term, or so I believe, this is our only chance on the world stage to ensure our ability to compete in the long term with India and China, and so I ask you, as a matter of urgency, to get your fellow-Commissioners round to your point of view and to produce this thematic strategy by autumn at the latest, which we enable you to do as you have promised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for your comments on thematic strategies. As Mr Bowis says, thematic strategies 6 and 7 are provided for in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. They are supposed to be presented within three years of the programme’s adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that I was furious with Mr Blokland. I very rarely get furious. I always stay calm, even when something is unpleasant or difficult for me. I shall try with all my power to overcome any difficulties that arise, with your help.</p>
<p class="contents">The contribution of the European Parliament remains very important. Parliament has participated actively in the preparation of the air strategy. With continued cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, we will be able to provide the European Union with an effective and efficient way of addressing the impact of air pollution on human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Seeber quoted figures which are really very impressive and which supplement the figures I quoted previously.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of timing, the air strategies are ready, the preparatory work is completed and the inter-service consultations are over. The Commission will now have to take its final decision. Given the scale of the health and the environmental problems caused by air pollution, I expect that decision to be reached soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard some concern expressed that the air strategy is not ambitious enough. I fully agree that the effects of air pollution are serious and the strategy must ensure further substantial improvements. The strategy will be ambitious, but it should also be achievable. We know that environmental policies can promote competitiveness and create high-quality jobs. Interestingly, the countries that have come closest to meeting the Lisbon targets are those with the most ambitious environmental policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the potential impact for Europe’s competitiveness has been analysed and we are satisfied that the impact of the air strategy will be very limited. Moreover, our competitors in China, India, Korea, the United States and Japan are also taking serious action on air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by reiterating the importance of an ambitious and forward-looking air strategy. Cleaner air will reduce the human suffering that air- related diseases cause: asthma and bronchitis, lung cancer and increased infant mortality. Air quality reduces the life expectancy of the average European by eight months. It destroys our lakes and forests and this is our overriding challenge. The air strategy has been thoroughly prepared; it is based on sound science and economics. It has gone through extensive stakeholder consultations and full impact assessment, as well as cost benefit assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
