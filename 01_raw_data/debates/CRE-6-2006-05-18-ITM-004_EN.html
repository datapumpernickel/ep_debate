<p class="contents">Recent trends seem to indicate a growing vulnerability of the European Union to disasters, and natural disasters in particular. The incidence of extreme weather events and related natural disasters is increasing, perhaps fuelled by the effects of climate changes. This year again, floods have raged in central and eastern Europe with four countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria – requesting assistance through the Community mechanism for civil protection. I am proud to say that European solidarity and generosity has once again mitigated the affliction those countries had to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">The four reports rightly point out the human, environmental and financial costs of such disasters. The Commission therefore very much welcomes the European Parliament’s initiative to examine the various aspects involved, with a joint effort by no less than three parliamentary committees. The jointly organised hearing earlier this spring has certainly made a valuable contribution to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports rightly consider a whole range of measures aimed at improving risk prevention and the response to crises. The Commission agrees with the recommendations regarding the need to adjust action in the area of prevention and management of natural disasters, as well as the need to coordinate Community instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the reports reinforce the Commission’s integrated approach to its policy on disasters, which includes instruments regarding prevention, immediate response and more longer-term, solidarity-based action. This approach is intended to strengthen the EU’s capacity and effectiveness in preparing for and responding to major disasters, while avoiding duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals contained in the reports have already been endorsed through the Commission’s action. We are now proposing even more concrete ways to act. Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports. These proposals are consistent with the Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument. The recent Barnier report also explores certain forward-looking suggestions for our response to disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the progress on the negotiations for the proposed floods directive on the assessment and management of floods and the positive vote in the recent ENVI Committee meeting. The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection, prevention and preparedness, regardless of where they live in the Community: in transboundary or national river basins, or in the coastal areas of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are floods on the increase with changes to our climate, but droughts have become more prevalent in Europe. At the request of a number of Member States, the Commission is analysing the issues of water scarcity and droughts. Options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another relevant instrument for the future could be Life+, the new financial instrument for the environment. It aims, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to support the efforts of Member States in the field of forest fire prevention, mainly through the implementation of knowledge-related measures such as training and awareness-raising campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the Commission is prepared to cofinance prevention measures under the cohesion and rural development policies. Member States are invited to include appropriate actions in their programmes for the forthcoming period, where prevention will be one of the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the rural development pillar, Member States can also implement specific measures to restore the potential of forestry or agricultural production. Under the rural development programmes, they can also request that a ‘severe natural disaster’ be recognised as <span class="italic">force majeure</span>, in order to derogate from certain conditions under the ‘agri-environment’ measures. Those possibilities continue in the new programming period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, though, that natural disasters are not the only threat the Union is faced with. It must be prepared for and able to respond effectively to challenges. Major man-made disasters, major threats to public health and acts of terrorism might require just as much of a common European response. For the Commission, it is sometimes difficult to explain why the Union should be absent in some circumstances. The lack of a concrete expression of Union solidarity has already been a source of embarrassment to the Union during some of the traumatic events of recent years. The Commission is therefore particularly grateful for the widespread support expressed in Mr Berend’s report for extending the EU Solidarity Fund to non-natural disasters and for enlarging the scope of eligible operations accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund created in 2002 has generally worked quite successfully, if judged against the objectives and conditions set out in its legal basis. Aid has been granted in 21 cases, concerning 15 Member States and candidate countries. Those who criticise the Solidarity Fund as being ineffective or too slow have a point. However, experience since 2002 has also led the Commission to the view that the existing fund has a number of shortcomings and that modifications to the current regulation are necessary. That is why we have proposed a new Solidarity Fund Regulation. The new proposal is based on the current Solidarity Fund, while introducing a number of modifications aimed at widening its scope, making the fund more transparent, and introducing a number of operational improvements, in particular the possibility of making advance payments so that the fund reacts more quickly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission nevertheless considers that the fund must remain limited to public emergency intervention. Insured or private damage, including agricultural damage, should not be compensated. The ‘polluter pays’ principle and third party liability must continue to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the current fund, the new proposal is based on the subsidiarity principle. The EU should intervene only when a state is considered to be no longer in a position to tackle a disaster alone. Consequently, there should be a relatively high threshold for European intervention. Today this threshold is defined in terms of direct damage, which must exceed EUR 3 billion, or 0.6% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new proposal, the Commission has therefore sought to improve the transparency and simplicity of the criteria governing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund. That would help the national authorities to have a clearer idea of when the fund is likely to be able to support them in recovering from a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the enlarged scope, a major element of the proposal is therefore a new definition of the criteria for triggering the fund. The operationally complicated regional criteria would be abolished in favour of only quantitative criteria. In compensation for the loss of the regional criteria, the quantitative threshold would be reset at EUR 1 billion, or 0.5% of GNI, whichever is the lower. This would increase the predictability of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund decisions, thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">Solely in the case of truly unexpected and exceptional situations, such as those where physical damage is limited, for instance terrorist attacks or major public health crises, the new fund could be mobilised by a political decision of the Commission, to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The huge scale of some disasters in recent years, and last year in particular, has led Parliament to give due consideration to this issue. Three committees have been set up to provide solutions, from their particular perspective, for preventing disasters or for offsetting the impact thereof when it is not possible to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked on this report for some six or seven months and, having spent that time listening to many MEPs, specialists, economic agents, local, regional and national authorities and the communities affected, I found the experience highly rewarding. I was also able to go to the six worst affected Member States last year, namely Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, France and Italy. I was delighted with the welcome accorded to us everywhere we went and I have no doubt that in bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, we performed useful work for our institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also worked hard to establish as broad a consensus as possible on the proposals that I shall present to you. I was able, in fact, to accept all the amendments that were tabled – 53 out of 60 – and the few exceptions were for formal reasons of redundancy or duplication and not because of their content.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us is based on three main ideas. Firstly, agriculture and forestry are activities that are closely bound up with the natural world and are therefore at the mercy of climatic phenomena, and exposed to bio-sanitary risks resulting from air, water and ground pollution and from increasing globalisation. Secondly, the exodus from the countryside is one of the main causes of the increase in forest fires in southern Europe, especially acute during times of drought, as the year 2005 sadly proved. The EU’s budgetary limits must, however, be respected. The proposals therefore submitted fall within the financial perspective that we adopted yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thrust of my proposal is therefore to optimise the existing political instruments, for example the Solidarity Fund, the European Agriculture and Rural Development Funds, the Veterinary Fund, regional policy instruments, the future Life+ Regulation, by improving them and adapting them within the context of genuine disaster and risk management systems. In the case of the latter, this will be done by communitarising a system of insurance and reinsurance to be cofinanced by the farmers, the Member States and the EU via the EAFRD.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund will need to be broader in scope and more flexible, to cover disasters that unfold over time, such as drought, which is currently not included. In order to make it more effective, a flexibility clause should be attached to it to ensure the provision of adequate financial resources when they are needed, from common agricultural policy headings that currently go unused.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding priority of EAFRD, on the other hand, should be actions aimed at the forestation and reforestation of burnt areas, along with all possible prevention measures, such as upkeep of forests, the use of biomass to produce energy, the training of economic agents involved and the supply of information to them, and awareness raising on such problems, all made possible with greater cofinancing from national rural development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just a brief summary of a few points, which illustrate the importance of Parliament addressing the agricultural aspect of such disasters, and I hope that Parliament will lend its fullest possible support.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and the Council will give due attention to these proposals, taking account of the urgent nature of the circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gerardo Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, over the last eight months we have visited the areas affected by natural disasters in many of the Member States and we have held a public hearing at which some of the people who have not had the opportunity to speak in their own national Parliaments have been able to speak. Today we are presenting concrete proposals, which the other institutions cannot allow to be thrown into the litter bin.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members could legitimately be pleased with the work done in this area. It is more than the public administrations directly responsible in some of the Member States have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that we should ask ourselves whether we are more prepared now than we were eight months ago to prevent and combat this kind of disaster and whether we now have more effective mechanisms for helping those suffering the consequences of fire, water or drought. I am not sure.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to thank all of the parliamentary groups for their commitment and dedication over these months of intensive work. I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for taking an interest in who was going to attend the hearing, although I must admit that I would have preferred him to show his support by immediately visiting the areas affected, avoiding the bureaucratic procedures that delayed us for four months and resulting in us missing the opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity of all of us – I am sure – with the victims straightaway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank Parliament’s services for the professionalism they have shown. They were subject to all kinds of pressures before, during and after the visits made.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we have been able to vote on these reports at the same time as the reform of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, because we have noted general dissatisfaction with the application of this Community instrument in each and every place we have visited, Mr Piebalgs. I believe it to be essential that the Council accept Parliament’s amendments, in particular those that demand, on the one hand, that the Fund assist all of the victims and their families, and on the other, that the Fund’s limits of applicability be reduced and that this Fund can be applied when certain areas are completely destroyed, as in the case of Riba de Saelices, which we have visited.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on these visits we have seen the deficiencies in the information campaigns aimed at prevention and the lack of coordination amongst the competent public administrations in the Member States, including, as we have seen, in Pampillosa da Serra, for example. We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society, in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society. I therefore hope that the proposals contained in the reports being submitted for Parliament’s consideration today receive wide support and send a clear signal to the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like quickly to summarise what we are asking for by means of ten points. First: a European strategy to combat natural disasters; secondly: the involvement of regions and local bodies; thirdly: flexibility in the redistribution of the funds available; fourthly: a Community forest-fire protection programme; fifthly: a specific proposal, Mr Piebalgs, for a directive for fire prevention and management in the European Union; sixthly: that the Seventh Framework Research Programme, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and the Galileo system be applied in order to assist in prevention and early warning; seventhly: information and educational programmes and campaigns agreed with the Member States; eighthly: a Community civil protection mechanism; ninthly: that additional financial instruments also be applied, such as EIB loans or State aid for regional purposes; and tenthly: that the European Parliament continue to carry out its duty of control with regard to the shortcomings in the fight against fire and all of the problems relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I would call upon everybody to put aside the party-political differences that may have divided us so that we can create a broad parliamentary consensus, which is what the European citizens are demanding of us and which we owe in particular to those who have suffered the consequences of these natural disasters: their victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer in particular to the visits that we made to the six countries affected by natural disasters and the public hearing that took place in Brussels. In our own countries too – at least this was the case in Portugal – we held public hearings to gather suggestions, information and proposals put forward by the various stakeholders. I should also like to thank the Members for their backing, their suggestions and their amendments, and the experts who helped improve my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The climate is changing. The year is no longer divided into the traditional four seasons. Days of unbroken drought alternate with days of torrential rain and with heat waves. Climate change lies at the root of the natural disasters – be they floods, extreme droughts or fires – that have been occurring with increasing frequency throughout the world and have caused terrible damage in terms of human loss, environmental deterioration and reduced economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the major problems of our times. 2005 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the Asian tsunami. The process of identifying the dead and looking for survivors went on for a number of months. In the summer of that year, a series of fires destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in Portugal, France and Spain, and violent floods spread devastation and death in countries such as Germany and Austria. Outside Europe, Hurricane Katrina wreaked unprecedented destruction in a number of North American States, and before the year was out, Afghanistan was hit by a violent earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to earthquakes, seaquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods and fires, there are other phenomena associated with climate change and global warming that cause sea levels in coastal areas to rise and beaches to disappear. Studies published in <span class="italic">Science</span> magazine reveal that sea levels could rise six metres by 2100, given that the ice of the Arctic and Antarctic is melting increasingly quickly. In order to prevent the worst case scenario, serious measures must immediately be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to honour the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you referred to the water shortage. Indeed, water must also be used more sustainably, more sensibly and more efficiently. More than 1 billion people fight for survival every day because they do not have drinking water, 400 million of whom are children. Water-related diseases kill a child every 15 seconds and are linked to many other diseases and malnutrition. The distribution of resources between the different domestic, industrial and agricultural users needs to be studied and debated, and waste must be combated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to encourage the citizens to help prevent these disasters, by reducing greenhouse emissions, as I have said before, by protecting the forests and by not building in high-risk areas. Natural disasters cut across borders and their environmental consequences also affect neighbouring countries. Given that Community action should complement that of the national authorities, in terms of prevention, planning and intervention, rehabilitation and follow-up, it is essential to step up coordination at all levels, to improve the existing mechanisms and to develop early warning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Although each region has its own characteristics and each case is different, there are common needs to be addressed, such as defining risk assessment mechanisms and drawing up maps of areas of drought, forest fires and floods. My report contains a number of other proposals, which I naturally hope will be endorsed, first and foremost, by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, examples of which include the definition of prevention systems to facilitate the fight against the causes of natural disasters; improved urban planning, especially in coastal areas and high-risk areas; the preservation of natural ecosystems; increased cooperation on civil protection between the Member States and at EU level in order to ensure the availability of additional resources for rapid action to address emergency situations; and the simplification of the rules on implementing the instruments, such as the Solidarity Fund and the Forest Focus Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rolf Berend (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters – for example the many forest fires and floods, not least in the summer of 2005 – there is an ever-growing demand for European solidarity. The solidarity fund set up in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2002 and designed to run until 2006 is intended to give the European Union greater freedom to act in the event of major disasters or crisis situations, thereby playing a substantial part in enabling the EU to do more and target its efforts better in those areas in which the public expect the European Union to act.</p>
<p class="contents">As you, Commissioner, mentioned earlier, it was extremely difficult, not to say sometimes and in some situations impossible, to use the existing instruments at EU level as a means of responding appropriately to major crises, not all of which, it has to be said, were of natural origin. One can take as examples of this industrial accidents – such as the wreck of the tanker <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, or the bomb attack on Madrid in March 2004. In addition, the current threshold for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund is set extremely high, so that exceptional conditions and arrangements abounded.</p>
<p class="contents">The new solidarity fund regulation now rightly makes provision for the extension of its scope, in other words, no longer limiting major crisis situations to natural disasters, but extending the category to include industrial and technological calamities, except where the ‘polluter pays’ principle is applicable or where the damage can be covered by insurance. There is also a need for immediate action in the event of public health crises and when terrorists strike, although – and this is the crux of the matter – the budget must remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of a ‘major disaster’ has also been revised, so that a disaster is regarded as major if it causes damage estimated at in excess of EUR 1 billion or over 0.5% of the gross national income of the State concerned. One is talking here about damage in the public sphere rather than to private property or damage covered by insurance. As has been said, the threshold was formerly fixed at EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of gross national income, which threshold values had been proposed by the Commission and by this House, but not accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also intended that a new political criterion be introduced to enable the Commission, should extraordinary circumstances in a specific part of the territory of an eligible state sufficiently warrant it, to declare a disaster situation to be major, even if the quantitative criteria have not been fulfilled – a criterion that is likely to apply to acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be emphasised that the European Union’s solidarity fund is not a means for taking preventive action, but that it instead responds to disaster situations. That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action. The solidarity fund cannot engage in preventive health care, nor is it meant to; health policy remains a matter for the nation states, and by that is meant specifically the deployment of vaccines and medicines in the initial response to disasters, medical and psychological emergency care and measures to deal with the risk of contagious disease, for example as a consequence of flooding.</p>
<p class="contents">As before, the fund’s financial assets amount to a virtual budget of 1 billion marks, the significance of ‘virtual’ being that these funds can be drawn on only in the event of a disaster, and must first be mobilised by the Commission and Parliament; it follows that they cannot be transferred elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to all who have worked with me on this report – to the Bureau, to my colleagues, and to the Members of this House, irrespective of whatever groups they belong to, with hearty thanks to the Commission, too, for its good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not reflect sister city relations, but the fact that the city had been destroyed by a flood over one hundred years ago, and was rebuilt by an effort of solidarity involving the entire Europe. It was not us, it was not the European Union who invented European solidarity, and it has been in operation long before 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this does not mean that the Committee on Budgets does not support the existence of the Solidarity Fund and the currently planned modifications to its regulation. Our Committee wishes to see an efficient Solidarity Fund, and not one that narrows down artificially the scope of those eligible for assistance. We agree with the mitigation of damages suffered, and we pressed for the rapid activation of the system. We believe that it is important for the Fund to be situated within the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund represents a significant opportunity for the European Union to make its citizens aware of its existence in a manner that can be understood by all. The European Union can show, in a tangible form, that Brussels is not just a bureaucratic hydrocephalus, but also a helping hand. Numerous ungenerous rather than helpful proposals have been made during the debate, and I consider them to be a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for his thorough work, and hope that we will only need to use this Fund rarely or perhaps never, but not due to bad regulations inspired by selfishness, but to the absence of disasters causing damages. I know that my natural optimism is a mistake, but please support these funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Haug (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though the European Union’s Solidarity Fund has been in existence only since 2002, it is already in need of revision. Founded upon the principles of solidarity and aid in a crisis, it has proved its worth in dealing with the after-effects of natural disasters, but it has also become apparent over recent years that its scope cannot be limited to dealing with these. It has become more and more plain that industrial and technological disasters and the potential crises resulting from terrorist acts or – something that is of particular importance to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – a public health crisis, make it necessary that we should be in a position to respond and help by means of solidarity and financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Just so that it is clear to everyone, once and for all, I am not talking here about preventative measures, which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the remit of the Member States. Our concern is with help, on the basis of solidarity, in dealing with the spreading of diseases, with pandemics, or with accidents such as the one that happened at Chernobyl. We want to be able to help without in any way overloading the European budget with unnecessary functions, not even when natural disasters need to be dealt with. It is for that reason that I expect the House not to give its backing to the renewed demand – made in another report – for an observatory to report on drought, desertification and other effects of climate change, for these tasks are already being dealt with by the Commission anyway. It must be clear to us that every additional agency – or whatever else we want to call these things – restricts the financial elbow room available for our policies, and just how tight that elbow room is was the subject of a resolution yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some respects, an even more positive solution could have been reached, which was proposed in Parliament but which ultimately was not taken forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must address the natural disasters that have lain waste to Europe in recent years – drought, forest fires and floods – in terms of their impact on agricultural activity. As Mr Capoulas Santos correctly pointed out, agricultural and forestry production, unlike other economic activities, is closely bound up with nature and is therefore more fragile when natural disasters strike. I therefore feel that following recent experiences, there needs to be a fresh approach to European farming in terms of preventing and responding to natural disasters. Current national mechanisms are often inadequate and one-off supranational response mechanisms are often inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the Solidarity Fund, which has already been mentioned today and which we will certainly continue to speak about. The Fund is currently under review and it is hoped that drought can be included in its scope. At a time when climate change is already being felt and when the vulnerability of farmers in the face of such dangers is becoming increasingly apparent, I feel that it is vitally important to draw up a Community strategy to combat natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, in the next financial framework a Community forest and flood protection programme should be created with the appropriate funding, with a view to encouraging awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management. This Community programme could be funded by a specific regulation, by its own funding or by its own budget heading under EAFRD or LEADER+, in accordance with an oral amendment that is to be tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must therefore provide a clear response for the communities it represents, who have suffered as a direct result of the natural disasters and who are naturally expecting our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For Portugal in particular, in common with other Mediterranean regions, 2005 was the driest year in the last 105 years. In December, around 87% of Portuguese territory was suffering from extreme drought. This was particularly serious in the Algarve region, where the climatic conditions were exceptional – a combination of high temperatures and the dryness of the air. In the Algarve region, the natural disaster of the drought of 2005 and the devastation caused by the 2003 forest fires had a terrible impact on local infrastructure, on the natural and cultural heritage and on farming and tourism. The water supply to the communities concerned was markedly affected in terms of scarcity and compliance with required quality standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Natural disasters are known to occur when extreme weather events affect a vulnerable area. It is therefore crucial that the fragility of these regions be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">European cooperation on civil protection must be stepped up, in order to ensure rapid response for the affected areas. There must also be increased prevention and a rapid response preparedness instrument for emergency situations. This is what these own-initiative reports seek to do and to coordinate. Even so, the Solidarity Fund has a long way to go before it is fully developed, which is why we are discussing it.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore be acknowledged that almost all the affected areas are classified by the EU and that following the devastation we cannot simply say that we have fulfilled our civil responsibility. The restoration of lost ecosystems is vital for the balance of these areas. To this end, solidarity is also crucial. It is also crucial to enhance information and awareness raising among the communities and regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters, so as to reduce the risks and the impact of those disasters and so that the people know what they can do to preserve the natural resources in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity has been a key word in the EU ever since the Treaty of Rome. Let us make sure, however, that it does not become just another empty word in the Community vocabulary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various disasters that have taken place, the distress they cause - which we share with the victims insofar as we are able, as outsiders - and the discontent that is expressed show just how sensitive these issues are.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout our debates, we have listed what these various natural disasters might have consisted of: fires, cyclones, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods, health crises, terrorist attacks, droughts, shortages of drinking water, industrial and technological disasters, agricultural disasters and undoubtedly many more. That is a long list that affects our Union and that calls on it to shoulder its responsibilities. Yet, as we were able to recognise in our debates, those responsibilities are shouldered by a variety of partners. First and foremost, they are sometimes shouldered by those responsible for the disaster, or for a fire, for example. Yet they are also shouldered by insurance companies, which are obviously affected, by the Member States and by the various organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the European Union's role, what is its mission, in this general context? For, as my fellow Member, Mrs Madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers. Yet, what are these powers, before, during and after these natural disasters? I think that, after having heard our fellow Member, Mr Galeote, draw up a fine list just now, there is a need, Commissioner, for total clarity regarding this responsibility of the Union, before, during and after disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to prevention, as with regard to protection measures, I believe that we do in fact have a power to exercise and a role to play in the fields of research and coordination. As regards the retrospective measures, which draw on our Solidarity Fund, our fellow Member, Mr Berend, has done a very fine job, but much remains to be done because it will always be very difficult to find ideal solutions, given the variety of situations and funding. We have a huge amount of work facing us. What I am asking you to do, Commissioner, is to find a better solution and to ensure that the European Union responds very clearly in the wake of these disasters. Our fellow citizens need a European Union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is now a matter of facing up to the damage caused by those disasters, and we all agree on the need to support the victims and to help them get back on their feet and rebuild their lives after the disasters, as well as the need to support the ‘Disaster' fund in order to show solidarity with all of the victims and to demonstrate that the European Parliament takes an interest in, and cares about, its fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we also call for investment in the areas of prevention and restoration, instead of the focus being merely on curing the ills. Even though we broadly support the analyses of the proposals drafted in various resolutions tabled, in particular, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Regional Development, I am disappointed by the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is refusing, as it were, to assume its share of the responsibility for the speed with which these phenomena are occurring. What shocks me is the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting that the aid not be deducted from the CAP resources. We have just spent a year witnessing a significant struggle aimed at obtaining a fund to preserve the biodiversity falling under Natura 2000, and we have failed. Yesterday, we all took note of that failure.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for Life +, I will be unable to agree to this programme – which is already well and truly dwindling away – serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is in reality our cultivation methods that we must change. The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example. The dams had to be knocked down because the Danube delta, which is prone to flooding, had virtually dried up. We now need to pose this crucial question: what kind of agriculture and what kinds of transport do we hope to have in the future if the Kyoto Protocol is regarded as the key element where climate change and the fight against this change are concerned? We must seek out the causes of these disruptions, and we, as Members of the European Parliament, know what they are: they are changes in modes of transport. I am in favour of a Solidarity Fund and of giving aid to the victims, but let us genuinely seek out the causes, otherwise we are just going to make changes to a never-ending problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new proposal for the Solidarity Fund needs to respond to the difficulties that have been experienced in relation to its application since it was created in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the Fund should be adapted to the specific characteristics and the actual needs of the different countries faced with a very wide range of different disasters, as in the Mediterranean area. We therefore tabled a proposal aimed at reintroducing the concept of exceptional regional disasters, as laid down in the current regulation governing the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that this is a view voiced in the opinion delivered by the Economic and Social Committee, which deems it necessary to continue to address disasters with a serious regional impact. I also wish to point out that the report by the Committee on Regional Development before us today takes the view that the Fund should be applied when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Portuguese Parliament adopted a resolution aimed at maintaining the possibility of providing support in the event of regional disasters with a significant socio-economic and environmental impact in the least favoured regions of the EU. We also tabled proposals intended to ensure that both the promotion of support for reinstating production activity in areas affected by disasters and making land and air equipment immediately available to fight against forest fires should figure among the eligible actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we proposed that, as laid down in the regulations of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, a level of economic and social development in a region or Member State should be taken into account when financial assistance is granted under the Solidarity Fund. Among other aspects that form part of the new proposal for a regulation, I should merely like to underline our concern at the broadening of the scope of application of the Fund without the financial ceiling being increased. In other words, we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We also oppose the idea of reducing the mobilisation threshold whereby the EU Member States with the highest GNI stand to benefit most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to highlight the rather perfunctory treatment of the damages caused by frost, which is also a form of natural disaster. I understand that natural disasters such as fires and droughts are issues somewhat closer to the rapporteur’s heart because he lives in the Mediterranean region. In Central and Northern European countries, frost causes very serious financial losses in the agricultural sector, especially in orchards and in the field of soft fruit production. When working on this draft, we should create a systemic solution that could apply to all regions of the European Union and all types of natural disasters. That is why the elements that have so far been omitted should be incorporated into the report in order to make it complete.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was greatly emphasised in the report was the question of migration from rural areas and farmers abandoning their farms. This is partly caused by the lack of viability and the high cost of forest management. Serious losses in the forestry sector are caused by inappropriate forest management, monocultures across large woodland areas as well as the planting of inappropriate species of trees. I would just like to point out that, during discussions concerning this forestry strategy in Parliament two months ago, Members failed to mention the huge areas of forest where forest management is carried out in an exemplary fashion. I am referring here to state-owned forests, including those in Poland, where fires and hurricanes also cause significant damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, an increasing number of flood plains have been lost in the course of centuries, and experts believe that we in Europe have, by the building of dykes, pretty well exhausted the possibilities of technological protection against flooding, so that we will, in the near future, have to have ever greater recourse to what are termed ‘retention areas’. It would appear that respect for the forces of nature is disappearing altogether. There is – as is well known – increasing settlement and industrialisation in exposed areas, for example on the coastline and in the flatlands of rivers, and so natural disasters, under such circumstances, can be prevented only with great difficulty if at all, but we can make the effort – by means of a solidarity fund such as this one – to alleviate the consequences in so far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that the development and extension of early warning systems is essential in this respect; it is in this area that much remains to be done, and I regard this as an area in which the European Union, in particular, must act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can certainly make a number of improvements in terms of better coordination and the exchange of good practice. However, in the case of large–scale natural disasters, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we need higher–level arrangements for financial and technical operational help. ‘He who gives promptly, gives twice over,’ as they said in ancient Rome. <span class="italic">Bis dat, qui cito dat</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we deal exclusively in these reports with the consequences of natural disasters, we also need to pay great attention to preventative measures. In this respect, our policies relating to agriculture, forestry, water management, town planning and regional development policy also need to come under scrutiny, as they could have a substantial impact on the scale of the consequences of natural disasters. Take, for example, intensive animal husbandry, which is subsidised by the European Union, but which also leads to greater desertification in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to monitoring climate change and its consequences, I advocate closer cooperation between existing research and scientific institutions and the financing of new community programmes. New community institutions, however, usually require a lot of money – they are easy to establish, hard to dismantle – and I also advocate that, in addition to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we also take very great care to respect the principle of proportionality.

It has not therefore been an easy job to achieve a common position that makes it possible for this Parliament to act strongly and firmly in the coming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to stress certain important elements relating to natural disasters, since I believe that we must enhance the European Union’s measures for dealing with them, given that Community interventions have so far proven themselves to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore reasonable for this Parliament to ask the Commission for a European strategy for combating natural disasters, and furthermore one that acknowledges the specific characteristics of those of a Mediterranean nature, such as droughts and forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide resources aimed at the victims of these disasters. Furthermore, the creation of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification are important initiatives that we must promote.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the main innovations incorporated into the Solidarity Fund, which are going to make it possible to respond more quickly and effectively to disasters that the Member States cannot tackle alone. Together with natural disasters, admissibility is also extended to industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and emergency public health situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament must be firm with regard to the proposal to lower the threshold for mobilising the Fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused. Thanks to this measure, it will be easier to use the Fund than it has been up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is necessary to determine which emergency operations are essential for the re-establishment of the infrastructures and equipment affected, as laid down in the Regulation. The provision of air and land resources and the administration of drinking water are clear examples of this, without forgetting the technical assistance that the Commission will facilitate.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument must respond quickly and effectively, with financial aid, to extreme situations of drought, fire and floods, without forgetting the victims of these disasters who need immediate help and assistance, and who Europe must not turn its back on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the Solidarity Fund and we must not lose sight of this notion, because the European citizens expect us to respond to their demands. We are talking about a Fund that is a political instrument and, as such, it must resolve the difficulties faced by the areas affected and the people living in them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reason why we now find ourselves having this debate is because of a new development that constitutes an even more serious challenge to our territory: climate change due to global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a need to identify long-term prevention measures, which can be summed up using the concept of integrated land conservation. Let me explain: since land is subjected to a variety of challenges, a form of conservation is needed that will address all of the aspects in question together: flood safety, by increasing the retention times of our rivers; geological safety, by draining slopes that are characterised by an unstable equilibrium and that can cause numerous casualties, as the recent events in Ischia serve to remind us; and fire safety, through forest-based activities aimed at reducing the risk of fire, without excluding, of course, the possibility of using biomass for energy purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for short-term prevention, especially against floods, which should consist of a radar network that is capable of calculating precipitation and, thanks to river modelling, can guarantee a reaction time that is sufficient to protect the civil population and properties too.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Beaupuy has already pointed out, this is what we must do at EU level: draw far more attention to the matter, because that is the only way in which we will actually be able to address these risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur has already said, it was the devastation wrought by the floods in 2002 that prompted this House, the Commission and the Council to set the Fund up.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a second-generation regulation, and the clear and tight framework set down by the rapporteur makes it a really useful and flexible instrument that we can fully support. It is indeed the case that the fund is a reactive rather than a preventative instrument, but we believe it is irresponsible, when taking reactive action, to make the same mistakes that brought disaster in the first place. Take the example of the rivers that destroyed homes and property; never again must they be so tightly hemmed in; preventing them from being so is the only responsible way of using European taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to point out that some Member States have a tendency to simply pocket the European funding and tell the public that it is they themselves that are putting the aid measures in place. That is something I regard as unacceptable; we know that the European Union has a credibility deficit, and it is by this instrument that the EU shows that it stands by ordinary people in a credible way. The source of aid funds must not be concealed; instead, the Commission must ensure that it is clearly affirmed and that every locality to which it goes receives a report stating what proportion is derived from European funds. Those are the main amendments that our group has tabled in the hope of further improving this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are overlooking the fact that the policy for dealing with natural disasters should not be confined solely to the formulation of internal policies to address and prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important for the European Union to assume its share of the very heavy political responsibility for tolerating the causes of serious climate changes over recent decades. We need a stricter policy against European and any other industry that has contributed to them, inside or outside the Community borders, so that not only do they have to pay for the damage they have caused, but also – and much more importantly – they have to take measures of limitation and prevention in their future activities and bear the cost of such measures themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should also exercise its influence directly on the United States, which is completely ignoring and infringing the Kyoto Protocol and continuing its destructive action, which affects both European citizens and the citizens of the rest of the world. Foreign policy is therefore an equally important dimension. The geographical scope must be reviewed, in order to ensure support is extended to other countries beyond our immediate neighbours. This fund should apply to the various states involved, even to states who are not even candidate members, if they have been hit by an incident which has been caused by or originates in the geographical area of the Community or candidate states. In this way, other neighbouring countries will be entitled to solidarity from Europe, either through the fund or through the other mechanisms which apply to international cooperation. Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders. The fund regulation does not appear to take account of cumulative disasters or prolonged events during which a disaster develops gradually, such as drought. Cumulative disasters can also be addressed even if they took place when the fund did not exist, if they have visible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I recognise the importance of the existence of this fund and the significant extension of its scope. This does not mean that the regulation, as it stands, satisfies us or that the policy for addressing natural disasters should be limited to it. We expect far more, not only as the European left, but also as European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund. As usual, there is an ulterior motive at work here: it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised. Mr Berend suggests in his report, in the context of terrorist attacks, that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity. Pandemics are also included, presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund. Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it? Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment, thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice. Communities that have suffered disasters – natural or manmade – have their national governments to step in and assist. Even more likely to come to their aid, in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami, is the incredible generosity of the general public. The last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster – the EU – to turn up and make things worse! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although disasters on a larger scale occur on other continents, Europe is no stranger to them either. Forest fires frequently occur in southern Europe and floods are a regular occurrence in the central part of our continent. People affected by these disasters cannot be left without aid, and Member States should not be left alone to deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is laudable that, in Mr Capoulas Santos’ report, the problems in the agricultural sector are so clearly perceived, as it is a sector that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The problem of natural disasters has quite rightly been linked to another issue that could be described as a socio-economic disaster. It is something that threatens European farming in the context of what has been happening at the WTO, namely sudden market liberalisation and the abolition or weakening of protective mechanisms for European agricultural markets. Considering that market protection is being reduced, it is good that we at least have the prospect of aid in the event of a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the greatest merit of the reports we are discussing. The draft under discussion is an important step on the road to building true European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report adequately summarises the way in which agroforestry production is closely connected with nature and, therefore, with its extremes and accidents. Articles 2, 3, 9 and 12 outline the measures needed to restore the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The common goal – as Mr Prodi also highlighted – is to design the Community strategy to cope with disasters, both by means of prevention measures and by planning the mechanisms for using the Solidarity Fund and the various State aid regimes. As regards the development policies, I am in favour of the requested increase in cofinancing amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the articles highlighting the need for the activities aimed at raising awareness and training the parties involved to keep pace with research on the ground, and therefore documentation and mapping.

I think that its presence has added value in three sectors: prevention, immediate suppression and restoration.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as prevention is concerned, a typical example is flooding from rivers which do not concern just one Member State, but often many more, including candidate states. In Greece, for example, we have precisely this problem with the River Evros, which flows through Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. Consequently, we need a global strategy for addressing such problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as immediate suppression is concerned, a typical example is fires, where solidarity is needed between the Member States, which is why I believe we need a European civil protection force, as proposed in the Galeote report, which deals with such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Berend report deals with the problem of restoring damage through the Solidarity Fund which has existed – and rightly so – since 2002. However, I believe that we need to lower the thresholds for the eligibility of actions, as Mr Berend quite rightly proposes, and extend the scope to include technological disasters, such as major shipwrecks or 'flu epidemics, so that we can supply the populace with vaccines and address the matter adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The matters which we examine in the Berend report will proceed under the codecision procedure and, consequently, Parliament will fight to the end; however, on the matters addressed in the Galeote report, I think that Parliament should not lower the flag either. They are important to the citizens, they are matters which concern their daily lives and we need to fight to the end and put pressure on the Commission and the Council to proceed in the direction that we are calling for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Above all, we must emphasise floods, a matter which exists – and we have experienced it – in Greece, in the Prefecture of Evros where, due to the absence of national measures, the area is affected every year.</p>

We appealed at that time, and we continue to appeal, in the four excellent reports presented to us, not only, I would say, for a little less national self-interest regarding civil protection, but also, as Mrs Estrella proposes in paragraphs 3 and 4, for example, of her report, for enhanced European cooperation regarding civil protection. Mr Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point.</p>
<p class="contents">We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons. Firstly, the impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, the torrential rain in northern and eastern Europe, drought and the fires that wreaked havoc last year are there to remind us of the crucial need to act, and to act quickly, on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financial cost of these disasters is increasing, and our Member States are having more and more difficulty in meeting it by themselves. This is, of course, where the Solidarity Fund comes into its own, as it is designed to cover these emergency costs, such as the provision of water, energy and housing, or the repairing of basic infrastructure. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Mr Berend, who wants to make it easier immediately to access part of the payments and who also proposes to extend the benefit of the Fund to other types of disaster such as drought or even – as he mentioned – biological or chemical terrorist threats or attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will never, of course, succeed in preventing all natural disasters, but our duty is to help the Europeans who are hit by these tragedies and to coordinate our efforts more effectively in such cases. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, we must also support the creation of a permanent European civil protection force, the famous ‘Green Helmets’. Let us also support the less controversial creation of an operations centre for the management of major crises.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for having supported my amendment, the aim of which is to specify that special attention will be paid to remote or isolated regions, such as island and outermost regions. This specification guarantees that, as from 2007, this Fund can potentially be used in the French Overseas Departments - even if they do not fully meet the general eligibility criteria - so that they can take advantage of emergency aid when a major crisis occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The own-initiative report by the Committee on Regional Development highlights the devastating effect of these disasters on the economy, employment, national and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism and rightly emphasises the need for effective measures regarding warnings, civil protection and aid for the regions and populations affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur for having included my amendments concerning the outermost regions in the European strategy that he so earnestly desires, in the knowledge that, due to their geographical situation, those regions are exposed to natural risks of a specific character and intensity.</p>

<p class="contents">For our part, we must condemn the lack of a genuine policy for fire prevention and the leniency of the penalties relating to the causing of fires. If we are to be absolutely thorough in our observations, we must point out that, unfortunately, we have witnessed a lack of coordination between the public administrations responsible, and that, in the case of Guadalajara, this has undoubtedly aggravated the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter. In the case in question, they have felt ignored in their own region. From a democratic point of view, it is unacceptable that a committee of enquiry should be set up in Castilla-La Mancha but that the families of the victims should have been excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been the European Parliament that has had to come along and put that unspeakable political behaviour right. At the hearing held in Brussels to that end, therefore, a representative of the victims spoke and the European Parliament was able to hear their fair demands as the passive victims of a tragedy that has affected their lives. At least they have been heard. The courts will now decide whether anybody needs to take responsibility, in addition to any political responsibility, which will undoubtedly have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for approving an amendment that I presented on the victims and I hope that plenary will vote in favour of it. That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families, by means of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am very much in favour of the reform of the Solidarity Fund and I hope that the Commission, following the mandate from this Parliament, will present a proposal for a directive for the prevention and management of fires within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These texts, which represent Parliament’s opinion in this field, state what we have always expressed: the need to draw up and implement European policies for the prevention of those disasters, for immediate intervention capable of combating them effectively and for compensating for the damage caused. We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take Parliament’s proposals into account and respond accordingly, and we shall apply pressure in order to ensure that that happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agitation that, in my country specifically, have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament, in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors, even misleading people with regard to its very nature. Here today in this very debate we have heard untrue statements – half truths are always untrue – which are entirely contrary to Parliament’s opinion, which is expressed by means of the texts we are to approve and nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an insistence on a partisan and self-interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people, in my region, Castilla-La Mancha, for example. This kind of behaviour speaks for itself, and perfectly illustrates the nature of the people indulging in it. I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sad about the effects of disasters that have struck us hard and we are sad that we have not dedicated enough time, energy and courage to rejecting this regrettable manipulation. Nevertheless, our confidence in our men and women, our commitment to the truth and our dedication to making the proposals that Parliament will approve today a reality will be our best legacy. That is what we have worked for, that is what we are still working on, and we will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union should of course address this situation, but how do we go about this? I do not feel that the right response would be to create a single European policy to combat natural disasters, as proposed in one of the reports before us. I do not share the view that, once a problem is discovered, the reaction must be to regulate at Union level. As an advocate of consistent implementation of the subsidiarity principle, I take the opposite view, namely that changes to the law at Union level should only be carried out if the Member States are not able to resolve a given problem effectively by themselves. Natural disasters cannot be understood as homogeneous phenomena with single strategies and a single legal framework. Rather, the right way forward is to diversify. Floods are of a completely different nature to, say, fires or droughts. The formulation of a European strategy should be restricted to those types of natural disaster for which there can be added value attached to joint action at Union level. Otherwise, a joint strategy and directive would be meaningless and would be tantamount to excessive regulation without any positive consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the call to the Commission and the Council to table a proposal to harmonise compulsory measures aimed at punishing those who start fires is a glaring example of a violation of the subsidiarity principle. Just as fires do not usually have a European dimension, the Member States on their own should be responsible for punishing arsonists. On the other hand, I welcome the use of the proposed Galileo system for pre-empting and monitoring natural disasters across the Union, which is an important and positive aspect. As regards the Solidarity Fund Regulation, I particularly welcome the fact that financial aid will be made more accessible in the event of natural disasters, since instead of the current EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of GDP, billion-euro losses or 0.5% of GDP will be sufficient. Furthermore, where losses are lower, the Commission will, according to the proposal, be authorised to assess the situation. The Solidarity Fund will be able to help to repair any damage caused, which may for example help to improve the Union’s image in the eyes of Europe’s citizens. For this I thank all of the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it would appear to be indispensable for the EU to take joint action either to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact. The Solidarity Fund should therefore have a broader scope than it does at present. This would permit a faster response to crisis situations resulting from natural disasters as well as those caused by industrial or technological disasters, or by terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also necessary to formulate a European strategy for dealing with the impact of natural disasters, in addition to appropriate Community prevention measures, the tailoring of Structural Funds spending to disaster prevention and closer coordination with other Community instruments. Once we have secured the necessary flexibility with regard to the distribution of available resources from various funds, we can then increase their efficiency in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, both individual Member States and the European Union institutions have to focus in particular on making the existing early warning systems more effective in order to minimise the impact of disasters. Even the largest Solidarity Fund imaginable, let alone the actual level of funding available over the next seven years, would not be able to cover all the costs incurred by European Union citizens each year as a result of the damage caused by unforeseen disasters and catastrophes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These proposals relate to natural disasters, such as fires, droughts and floods. In Ireland, thankfully, we do not have forest fires or droughts; we have lots of rain – sometimes too much – but no major floods. Therefore, the Galeote Quecedo report is of little relevance to Ireland: it is heavily oriented towards the Mediterranean. I have no problem with that. If we are a European Community we must support each other, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity. European solidarity is the spirit that should underpin all our responses to initiatives such as the reports we are debating today. The Solidarity Fund is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports are well drafted. In the Galeote Quecedo report the emphasis is on prevention, research and risk management. It also proposes identifying vulnerable areas so that preventive measures can be put in place well in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucially important is that the environmental issue should be taken into consideration. Many of the environmental problems we are now encountering are caused by climate change and they are self-inflicted. Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement: they are manmade.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change, but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the world’s environment and we are doing it on a daily basis: greenhouse gas emission levels, for example, are being ignored by many EU countries, including, sadly, my own country. The sooner we, as a world community, wake up to this reality, the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and, hopefully, adopting today.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Berend once again on a job well done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Natural disasters belong to the latter group.</p>
<p class="contents">Frequent floods, such as those in the region I come from, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also the fires which are typical in the southern part of our continent, are real challenges for the international community, including the European Parliament. It is important in this context that, instead of increasing the funds set aside for such matters in the 2007-2013 budget, we should make them more flexible and remove the red tape which makes it impossible to use the funds in line with the types of disasters that occur. A good example is the situation in Poland in 1997, before enlargement, when my country was affected by major flooding and these funds were reallocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must make use of both the Structural Funds in order to minimise the effects of disasters, as well the European Solidarity Fund to help the victims of such disasters. As Mr Wojciechowski said a short time ago, this is an example of European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all wish for a better response to emergency situations. Significantly, we all recognise the need to work together. The resolutions passed by Parliament last year, these commendable reports and the Commission’s proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for increased cooperation in civil protection clearly reflects the Commission’s line of thought. To react effectively to a disaster, we need to have all our available resources in a state of ready deployment. When these do not suffice or are unavailable, the Commission needs to be empowered to find alternative means.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the agricultural aspects, I should like to emphasise that the Commission will do its utmost to optimise the use of existing instruments. It is clear that, at this stage, solutions or assistance for the agricultural or forestry sector in the event of natural disasters will have to come via existing instruments under the rural development and forest policies, state aid and the possibilities that exist under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be more cautious as regards greater budgetary flexibility to ease the problems for the agricultural sector. We are tied to the funds available. I see major difficulties in using underspent budget lines for disaster relief purposes, but the Commission is prepared to analyse the feasibility of any suggestions. One difficulty, for example, is that we will only know with any certainty late in the budget year whether there is any margin left in the budget. Finally, it should be remembered that in the future we will be more likely to have to apply financial discipline, which will reduce the likelihood of underspent amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also examining whether risk and crisis management instruments to support the agricultural sector could be a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful for the great expression of support the Commission’s proposal to adjust and improve the EU Solidarity Fund has received today. With the new fund, the EU will have an instrument at its disposal that allows it effectively to assist Member States and candidate countries whenever a crisis situation arises. An act of European solidarity can be counted on, no matter whether in response to a natural or another kind of serious disaster. This will be good not only for the European Union’s image but also, more importantly, for the Union, the Member States and acceding countries and their regions and, in particular, for the people affected by such disastrous events.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and other honourable Members have spoken in favour of all major elements of the Commission proposal. This represents invaluable support in steering the proposal through the remaining steps of the legislative procedure. In the light of this far-reaching agreement between our two institutions, the Commission appeals to the Member States and the Council to rethink their position which, up to now, has certainly been much less favourable than that of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that you have proposed to grant Solidarity Fund assistance to candidate countries only if the same disaster also affects a Member State, even if this issue has not been discussed today. While I understand the underlying reason – i.e. not to financially overburden the fund – this proposal puts candidate countries in a worse position than they are currently in. At present, they are on an equal footing with Member States as regards eligibility for the fund. I would ask honourable Members to reflect again on whether politically this is what they really want.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that the use of the Solidarity Fund for preventative measures has been proposed. There can be no doubt that prevention is an extremely important part of a comprehensive policy in relation to disasters, a view the Commission fully supports. But it cannot be the role of the Solidarity Fund, which has been designed to bear some of the emergency costs incurred by Member States in dealing with disasters. At EU level, prevention and reconstruction measures can be supported by the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, or by agricultural funds. In fact, risk prevention is one of the European Rural Development Fund’s priorities for the period 2007-2013. In addition, rural development measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can finance the restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and the introduction of appropriate prevention instruments, including risk prevention for forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to strengthen all of the European Union’s existing instruments for the benefit of our environment and, more importantly, for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who said that actions of solidarity and actions taken to prevent disasters and deal with their consequences will bring Europe closer to its citizens. These issues are extremely important in order to get the European citizens’ full support for our work. That is why I should like to thank again all the rapporteurs, Mr Capoulas Santos, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mrs Estrela and Mr Berend, for their excellent reports that will strengthen European identity.</p>

Due to the recurrence of such events, it is of the utmost importance that the solidarity instrument should allow for appropriate EU level response to major crises. As with the instruments that are currently available, it is extremely difficult to react properly, as illustrated by recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome our rapporteur’s approach, which argues that the Solidarity Fund must be adapted to new challenges and that there is potential for improvement in the way it is used. Major natural disasters within the Union can cause significant human, economic and environmental damages as well as it can affect more than just one European country. We must ensure that effective and targeted Community action is possible in areas where public opinion expects the Community to act. In this respect, we must also ensure that fund’s financial resources match its geographically and thematically enlarged scope of application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
