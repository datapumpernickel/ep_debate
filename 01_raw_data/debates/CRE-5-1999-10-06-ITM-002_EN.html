It has been gratifying to hear, after a gap of many years, positive news on the progress the peace process is making.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has changed since the last spring. Six months ago we were in a situation in which the implementation of the Wye River Accord, signed in October 1998, had come to nothing. The Israeli Government, owing to internal political pressures, was unable to secure the implementation of the treaty, and the country ended up going to the polls prematurely. The ending of the mid-term stage of the Oslo Agreement on May 4 this year made the situation more uncertain. The Palestinians had said they would unilaterally declare the existence of an independent Palestinian State on that day. When, at the same time, a heated election campaign got under way in Israel, the situation looked likely to come to a crisis. There was a general atmosphere of disappointment and uncertainty. Furthermore, people were afraid that terrorist attacks would increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the situation is to a large extent different. The result of the Israeli parliamentary elections and the election for Prime Minister in May was a turning point that made it possible to restart work on settling the conflict. Israel’s new government has given an assurance to the international community that it will strive in earnest to attain peace with its neighbours. There is always a hint of the unexpected associated with political developments in the Middle East, however. What is different about the situation at the end of last year compared with this spring is that this time there is some cause for hope. We have a display of increased political will, of the capacity for direct talks and the timely implementation of agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the European Parliament closely follows the development of the Middle East peace process and that there is a good deal of expertise here in matters relating to the region, as shown by the study published by the Parliament on the subject. I shall concentrate on developments since last spring. That was when Parliament last issued a statement on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland, as the country in the Union to hold the Presidency, has consistently considered the Middle East peace process to be one of the most important issues in the common foreign and security policy. We follow the development of the peace process carefully and are in close contact with all parties. The Finnish Foreign Minister visited the region on 1 – 5 August. The Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, is right now in the region, on a visit which will take in Israel, the Palestinian areas, Syria and Lebanon. Furthermore, we have regarded the comprehensive network of contacts set up by special envoy Miguel Moratinos, as well as his vast expertise, as being of immense benefit. His work has been very valuable from the point of view of EU transparency, visibility, and contact for discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made an important contribution to developments in recent months. We have always encouraged the parties involved to take part in discussions and negotiations. In addition, we have always tried to create opportunities to generate a climate of opinion that is favourable to the peace process and we have worked to ease tension. A good example of this is the declaration made at the Berlin European Council, which, in my opinion, played an important part in reducing tension in the spring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hoped that the EU will be more active in the Middle East peace process in many contexts. It is true that we are in a very influential position. Europe has a solid, one thousand-year-old Mediterranean connection to the Middle East and an unparalleled knowledge of the region. We are not trying to compete with the United States or any of the other players in terms of whose role is more important, but seek close dialogue with them. The prospect for the near future would appear to be that, with regard to the Palestinian track, both sides will discuss the matter directly with one another, without any appreciable participation on the part of others.</p>
<p class="contents">There is broad consensus among the Member States of the Union regarding the basic issues and objectives of the Middle East peace process. It has solidified during the last decade, which has meant that the role of the Union in the region has gathered strength. We are already now the largest donor of aid to the Palestinians, which is visible, from the political point of view, in the important contribution we are making, for example, to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee to coordinate Palestinian aid, to be held in Tokyo in mid-October. Economic cooperation and expert technical assistance in certain matters relating to the permanent status negotiations, and in the area of good administration, are those areas where we have been of help and where we are ready to act in the future also. In addition, the European Union believes it is very important to have projects involving the cooperation of citizens, which would bring individuals into contact with each other in a positive way. This kind of cooperation has quietly gone on during all the years of the cessation of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The current stage of the political peace process can be regarded as having once more got under way with the agreement made at Sharm el-Sheikh last month. The international community supports the agreement made by the parties involved. The implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum has got off to an excellent start, with Israel and the Palestinians fulfilling their obligations to the letter. The implementation of the agreement, through tangible practical action, will be the best way to rebuild trust between the sides. The agreement will create a new belief that the principles of Oslo have not been forgotten. In my view, there will be a need for faith and trust. The parties have purposefully left the most difficult and sensitive issues to be solved later. The one-year deadline set by the parties for signing a permanent status agreement is an ambitious one. However, determination, the consistent building of mutual trust, and the right attitude will make the objective achievable. The European Union is prepared to assist with every means at its disposal, should the parties so desire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian track has ever greater opportunities to start negotiations and thereby achieve peace, as both sides want peace. They only feel they should wait for someone else to make the first move. The opportunity must be seized, and we are ready to offer our services to all parties. I believe it is only a matter of time before talks begin.</p>
<p class="contents">In the rapid developments that have taken place in recent weeks, the Lebanon track seems to have been somewhat excluded from public attention. It is vital to bring about more stable conditions in Lebanon for her to develop favourably. We hope that a political solution for the Lebanese track can be found quickly, and we are ready to assist as best we can with regard to this track. </p>
<p class="contents">I have, up till now, examined the peace work mainly from the political standpoint. Politics has the main role in achieving peace, but, at the same time, economic and other types of regional cooperation will play an important part in increasing trust and, above all, securing the peace that has been achieved. This will be handled on a multilateral track. It still has not succeeded in living up to the expectations we had of it as a factor in supporting the peace process, but I believe that it offers every prospect of success. Indications of that are EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries within the framework of the Barcelona Process and moves to continue the MENA series of Summits next spring.</p>
<p class="contents">A just, comprehensive and lasting peace will bring with it, not only changes in regional cooperation, but also pressures for change within the countries themselves. We were glad to see the parties preparing to reconcile themselves to unavoidable bilateral compromises demanded on both sides. Now is no longer the time for harsh words. We earnestly believe the changes in the Middle East to be only for the good, if only people get to enjoy the fruits of change. Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, fully understands that there is an opportunity for profound change and will continue, together with our partners, to promote peace and the common interest with every means at our disposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have chosen an opportune moment for this debate. Hopes for peace in the Middle East are higher now than they have been for many years. The election of a new and more constructive government in Israel and the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum last month have set the stage for a relaunch of the peace process. There are clear signs too that both sides mean business. The first troop withdrawals, prisoner releases, and yesterday’s agreement on the opening of the safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank, all show that both Israelis and Palestinians have begun again their efforts to reach a permanent peace. The permanent status negotiations have recently started once more. The differences are not to be underestimated. But with political will on both sides, they need not be unbridgeable. The European Union will do all it can to help the parties meet the February deadline for concluding an umbrella agreement. We also believe that the permanent agreement should be concluded within the target period of one year, as Minister Sasi said, as stipulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and as called for by the European Council in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we in Europe do to stand by the peacemakers? It is right that we should match their renewed political commitment to move forward with practical support from the European Union. That, as the Presidency has just made clear, is what the Union collectively is doing. President Ahtisaari is in the Middle East, a point made by the Presidency, Ambassador Moratinos has been accompanying him and will I know continue to work hard to maximise the European Union’s contribution in the coming vital months.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pressing ahead with the implementation of projects such as the construction of the Gaza seaport and the safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza: projects which are invested with political and social as well as with economic importance. We are also hoping for an early relaunch of the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks, and will continue to assist the parties with a view to early resumption of these crucial talks.</p>
<p class="contents">But peace in the Middle East has a broader dimension – it extends wider than the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, central though they are. That is why we are keen to revitalise the multilateral talks and regional cooperation. The Presidency and the Commission have renewed their call for a monitoring committee meeting of the regional economic development working group to take place as soon as possible. This is, of course, chaired by the European Union. After three years of impasse, this would bring Israelis, Egyptians, Palestinians and Jordanians together again at official level.</p>
<p class="contents">We are taking other practical steps which are calibrated to the new political climate. The Commission has stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We will propose to Member States next month financing of more than EUR 20m for such projects. This package includes renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels. The first generation of people-to-people projects, 17 of them in all, costing some EUR 5m, will start soon. Members will recall that the European Union, as the Presidency said, is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a word about our assistance to the Palestinians, a subject in which this Parliament has taken an appropriate interest. In general, we look to both Israelis and Palestinians to improve their performance in removing obstacles that prevent international aid from achieving its goals. The Palestinians, for their part, need to persevere in the path of sound institution-building including, and I stress this point, budgetary transparency. In addition, Israel must find more effective ways of reconciling its legitimate security concerns with the urgent need for genuine Palestinian development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to have recently reached agreement on the update of the tripartite action plan. This plan, honourable Members will recall, details Israeli, Palestinian and international donor obligations in the framework of the assistance efforts to the Palestinian Authority. The improved political climate should, I hope, allow for more progress on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We have consistently pressed for the building of sound and accountable institutions in the Palestinian Authority. I am pleased to report, therefore, that President Arafat has endorsed the recently published report on strengthening Palestinian institutions, prepared by the independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations with substantial European Union assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">President Arafat has appointed several senior ministers to a special committee. They will meet the task force, including President Prodi, in Brussels next month to discuss the implementation of the report’s far-reaching recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also continue discussion on these issues at the upcoming meeting of the ad hoc liaison committee for assistance to the Palestinians – the meeting in Tokyo – which is the international donor mechanism. We will press for the next meeting of this committee to be held in Portugal in line with the understanding reached at the Frankfurt meeting last February. I have every confidence that we shall succeed in that. In view of our major share of total assistance to the Palestinians of over 50%, most future donor coordination meetings should, in our judgement, be held within the Union, co-chaired by the European Union Member State hosting the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to report that the tenth convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was signed last week. The Commission has already initiated the first payments under the new convention. This will allow us to help deal with UNRWA’s severe cash shortfall and to continue our crucial support to the Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also express my gratitude to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and indeed to the whole Parliament, for the very thorough report and for your support, in the framework of the consultation procedure, for the Commission’s efforts in finalising the convention. I would like to pay particular tribute to the rapporteur, Ms Morgantini. Let me also thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as the Committee on Budgets, for their support for the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given you a summary of the efforts we are making with the presidency to help bring peace at last to the Middle East. We look to the parties to carry out in actions what they have put their names to on paper. In exchange, Europe will continue to play its full part in the peace process. But let me also stress that we intend to continue working closely with the United States, not as competitors, but as partners, in this matter. We recognise the crucial role of the United States, which has wrestled for so long and with such tenacity to bring peace to this troubled region; and I pay warm tribute to those efforts – for example, to the negotiating skill and determination of the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="contents">It was Yitzak Rabin who famously remarked that you do not make peace with your friends. No-one underestimates the scale of the challenges ahead: peace will not come tomorrow. But peace will come – of that I am sure; with time and with patience, allied in equal measure to the will of the parties to achieve it and the will of outsiders to help bring it about. We have today a new chance for peace in the Middle East. Our task is to do all we can as Europeans to give that peace a chance and to hasten the day of its arrival. That is what we, with your active support and encouragement, intend to do.</p>

The simple truth is that it is not possible to find absolute truths in a dispute whose origins are interwoven with the very roots of our civilisation. This is exactly why the determination that Israelis and Palestinians are now showing in the way they are developing and applying their agreements is opening up an amazing opportunity for hope. Further proof of this feeling is the way the recent stumbling blocks relating to the introduction of the 45-kilometre corridor which will unite Gaza with the West Bank, have been overcome in the last few hours.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as Mr Patten put it so well, we must not underestimate the difficulties lurking on the horizon, which will certainly trip us up in critical situations – hopefully these will only be fleeting – during which we should all bear two things particularly in mind: firstly, that the way forward must always be dialogue between all those involved, which is genuine, open and direct. Secondly: that it must be seen that both Israelis and Palestinians have a common enemy – terrorism – in all its forms, whose only aim is to destroy peace, freedom and respect for human rights. Particularly given our own current historical context, there is no possible justification for the use of violence, wherever it may come from.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have to resort to the figures on commercial exchange, investment and cooperation in development to see how important a role the European Union plays in the region, but the European Union’s proven economic solidarity must be valued as highly as its ability to contribute efficiently to a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Minister Sasi’s recognition of the efficient work done by the European Union’s special envoy, Ambassador Moratinos. Nevertheless, the fact that we have mentioned it so many times does not mean we can stop discussing the lack of vision of our contribution, as Europeans, to the peace process. This is another area for which the European Parliament must accept responsibility in line with its stated desire to contribute to developing a common foreign policy for the European Union. Given this context, I think that this House should have two immediate objectives: to set in action the parliamentary structures of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, bearing in mind that this could be a very useful instrument for securing peace. It should also put into practise the initiative of Parliament’s President, Mrs Fontaine, who is to make a tour of the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Through the Wye River and Sharm el-Sheikh Agreements, the new political situation in Israel, a decisive PLO leadership and, not least, a deeper insight into the Arab world, a new situation has been created which prepares the ground for a real and sustainable solution in the region’s interests. Seldom have the prior conditions for progress been as good as they are now. It is Israelis and Palestinians who are the main players. They themselves have the key to this solution. Today’s leaders are conscious of their historical responsibility. In this situation, it is very important that both sides refrain from unilateral undertakings which might jeopardise the process. </p>
<p class="contents">With commitment and disquiet, indefatigable diplomatic energy and enormous financial commitments, the surrounding countries have followed the Middle East drama for more than half a century. As has been evident here, the EU has a growing and important role in the region. I fully support the Presidency’s and Commissioner Patten’s constructive attitude here today. </p>
<p class="contents">Our new Parliament is today sending out a new and clear signal of vigorous and sustained support for the peace process which must open the way to progress, democracy, respect for human rights and hope for the future for all people in the region without exception. And, not least, it will open the way to peaceful co-existence between Israel and the independent State of Palestine. The Group of the Party of European Socialists unanimously backs the multi-party resolution which has been set out here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the safe passage is physically just a narrow corridor through which freedom of movement, a central tenet of European Union philosophy, is hedged about with many necessary security constrictions. May these soon ease as confidence builds up.</p>
<p class="contents">Free trade also needs fair pricing in order for the producer and the seller to make due profit, as well as honest labelling of product origins and processes to satisfy the customers’ requirements on health and choice. Both these key free trade elements have been absent in part or in whole from Palestinian export trade, particularly in textiles and in agricultural products. Conflict has dominated the trade agenda too.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion calls for an end to all trade obstructions. Only then can three close neighbours – Israel, Palestine and Jordan – build real prosperity for all their peoples.

In fact, we all welcome the developments that have taken place since Mr Ehud Barak was elected Prime Minister of Israel. We welcome the relaunch of the peace process and the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, which came into being after what were certainly laborious negotiations and which, to this day, has had the respect of all parties. The protocol that was signed yesterday concerning the link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan is also a cause for celebration. We may be in optimistic mood but we are still troubled. The new Israeli Government is persisting with its policy of colonising Palestinian areas and remains the hostage of the Likhud party, which multiplied the number of settlements in order to prevent people from returning to the Palestinian areas. As far as these settlements are concerned, both in the Syrian Golan Heights and in the Palestinian areas, we want to draw the Commission’s attention to the matter of the preferential tariffs that Israeli products attract.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we need to ensure that these preferential tariffs also apply to products from the settlements. The previous Commission took certain precautions to this end. More attention must be given to these measures, otherwise we will be giving <span class="italic">de facto</span> encouragement to those pursuing a policy of colonisation, and that when the European Community together with the rest of the international community, the United States included, has constantly condemned this policy and we are all aware that Israeli settlement policy is a major obstacle on the long road to freedom and a true Palestinian state.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in the Middle East is still a long way from this, but without doubt, the election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of Israel and the Palestinian’s peaceful choice have given peace a chance. This was shown by recent developments in the reworking of the Oslo Accord at Sharm el­Sheikh. But for peace, or at least possible justice to materialise, the Israeli authorities need to take more steps – some colleagues have already said this – not only because of the Palestinian-Israeli question, but also because of the Lebanese and Syrian question. The occupation of southern Lebanon must end and Syria’s land must be returned, as laid down in various UN resolutions. Of course, this is all in the interests of the security of the Israeli State. However, the security issue cannot hide the illegality of the military occupation or bombings of civilians, which happen in southern Lebanon, or the existence of prisons like those in Qian. But the Palestinian question is still at the heart of the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">In March 1999 in Berlin, the European Union reaffirmed the Palestinians’ right to a sovereign, democratic State that will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State. In Sharm el­Sheikh, the conflicting parties undertook to lay down the final State by 2000. To achieve this, it is imperative that Israel realises that for the Palestinians, a sovereign state is not a generous concession but a right. Above all, Israel must not take any action that will change the territorial and demographic order of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. Still today, we hear news of Palestinian houses that have been demolished, confiscated land and the growth of colonial settlements. On 25 September, the military administration gave the go-ahead for the confiscation of Palestinian land belonging to 79 villages, in the Green Line area of cultivated and inhabited lands. The same happened in the village adjacent to Hebron. In East Jerusalem, men and women’s identity cards are confiscated to reduce their numbers in an operation that the centre for Israeli human rights has called ‘silent deportation’. Moreover, there is still the Palestinian refugees tragedy. Well, the UN resolution must be implemented. Of course, the opening of the corridor between Gaza and the West Bank is extremely positive, but Israeli checks make it difficult for men, women and goods to pass through. The European Union has a large part to play here. The European Union has played a positive and important role in the peace process in everything it has done and I think that it should continue to do so. In this sense, our role, the role that the European organisations are also performing, is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I should like to say that I very much appreciate the comprehensive statement made in the debate this morning by Commissioner Patten on the many complex issues which remain to be contended with in this very difficult area.</p>
<p class="contents">The outlook for the future in terms of securing a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East is, I believe, now more promising than ever. There have been key developments taking place in this regard, which have been mentioned by others. The new Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, has put in place a government with a sufficiently strong majority to allow him to resume negotiations in the peace process with adequate parliamentary support for his declared intention to get the peace process moving forward again.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak have already signed the memorandum to implement the Wye River Accord and to resume the final status negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of measures have already been implemented under the Wye River Accord, including the transfer of control over specific territories as well as the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners. Our Union must continue to play an active role in putting in place and consolidating a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East. The European Union is right to support a negotiated settlement in the Middle East which reflects the principles of the transfer of land for peace, which ensures the collective and individual security of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I welcome the decision by the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the nullification of the provisions of the Palestinian National Charter, which called for the destruction of Israel. They have also reaffirmed their commitment to recognise and live in peace with Israel. I am convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing negotiated agreements is the best guarantee for the security of Israel. I support the right of the Palestinian people to form a state, but one which comes about on the basis of negotiation and goodwill of all interested parties and not one which is brought about as a result of coercion.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Wye River Accord seems likely to proceed. The real difficulties will arise within the framework of the final status negotiations, which includes the contentious issue of Jerusalem, control over water rights and the return of refugees. Progress on these issues may be hindered by developments on the ground, such as the expansion of settlements or terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the statement of the Palestinian authority which has declared that it will take action against terrorism while Prime Minister Barak has informally given an understanding that he will try to limit the expansion of settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Barak has also vowed to end his reign of occupation of Southern Lebanon within a year. Peace talks between Israel and Lebanon which have been frozen since 1966 – and the conditions in which Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon is achieved – will be of particular importance for the safety of UNIFIL personnel who are based there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to questions relating to the sovereignty and security between Israel and Lebanon, the return of refugees will be of particular concern to Lebanon, whose ethnic balance is disturbed by the fact that there are 250,000 Palestinian refugees on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that Syria, which seeks complete restoration of the Golan Heights, has announced that it is willing to renew peace talks with Israel, but only from where they broke off in 1966. The issue has stalled there. I believe that the European Union and the United States working together will do their very best to get the talks under way.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to be very active in encouraging movement on both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They would have you believe that the major stumbling block is solely down to a failure on the part of the Israelis to be accommodating and cooperative. On the other hand, the West makes remarkably few peremptory demands of the Palestinian authorities. The Arab world itself often stays completely out of the picture. In this respect, there is no doubt whatsoever that the present joint motion for a resolution represents an improvement on certain previous resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to an accurate understanding of the long, drawn-out Arab-Israeli conflict still resides in the fundamental question as to how it began, in other words the cause of it. Well now, the cause certainly does not lie in what is termed the Palestinian question. This exists, of course, but this extraordinarily poignant question is, in turn, a legacy of the war that the Arabic States waged in 1948/49 against the recently proclaimed Jewish State. </p>
<p class="contents">The big test facing the peace process is likely to be the question as to whether the Palestinians will be able to introduce sound administrative structures. The Palestinians definitely deserve all the help both the Israelis and Europe are able to give to this end. This kind of interaction will also promote mutual understanding, which is an essential step towards real peace in the Middle East. As a matter of fact, paragraph 11 of the joint motion for a resolution links up perfectly with this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, both parties, Israelis and Palestinians, should themselves make it known if they require the European Union to act as a political mediator in the peace process.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore, like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance rejecting motions for resolutions which express views which are increasingly critical of the Israeli Government but which do not go into the problems of the other side.

It is a complex process – Commissioner Patten reminded us of this – and yet today, we have important deadlines and timescales during which things should happen which will bring us within sight of a definitive solution; that is, the recognition of two independent, sovereign states which can co-exist in a situation of mutual security. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that we must now reconfirm our commitment and make an exceptional effort which will supplement that of the contracting parties which clearly nobody can replace. But I think that within this framework, the European Union can perhaps play a more political role to help resolve controversial points. We have been reminded of the negotiations between Israel, Lebanon and Syria on the Golan Heights and the items on the agenda which have not yet been dealt with. However, I think it is important that no unilateral action is taken on these items which will compromise the negotiated solutions and I think that the two societies must immediately work together – Israel in a move towards security and the Palestinians in a move towards peace and prosperity. I do not think there is anything that cannot be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a final remark on the extremely delicate question of Jerusalem and its status, which naturally requires that both the Palestinians and the Israelis find a solution. I want to say that there is nothing that cannot be resolved, and to back this up, I will give my city, Rome, as an example which shows that within the capital city itself, it is possible for two States to co-exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Liberal Democrats’ opinion, Europe must continue to give its firm backing to the peace process and cooperation in the Middle East. But it must make commitments, not just on an economic level, but also on a political and cultural level and acquire a stature and political weight recognised in the region and the rest of the world. However, in defending the right to self-determination we believe that all parties must be urged to make real commitments against terrorism to ensure people’s security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, the Israeli Government must refrain from creating new installations unilaterally, carrying out expulsions of Palestinians and maintaining its settlement policy in East Jerusalem. We also think that it is important to continue and intensify the Community “People-to-People” programme mentioned in paragraph 11 of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace between these two States, Israel and Palestine, will be a lasting one only if their economy develops within the framework of regional cooperation favouring development which is sustainable and equitable for all parties – cooperation which prioritises the most vulnerable territories. We are thinking, for example, of the problem of water. The European Union must target this objective. It must also initiate the negotiation of Euro-Mediterranean Agreements with Syria and Lebanon and update the agreement signed with Jordan. The statements by the Council President and Commissioner Patten seem to us to be heading in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, it is true to say that we have come a long way since the beginning of the 1970s when I first became interested in the problem. At that time, the Palestinian people and the PLO were completely marginalised. The only people who took them even slightly seriously were the European Left. I must point out that it was only when the right-of-centre Netanyahu lost the election that the peace process got under way again. Even if there are grounds for optimism now, it has to be said that there are still a number of unsolved problems. There is the problem of the status of Jerusalem. There is the problem of international contact for the Palestinians via Gaza and that of an international airport on the West Bank and, not least, the question of resources for migrants. There will now be the important task of keeping both parties on the track of peaceful development. I think that the EU can play an active role if it is prepared to use economic incentives and keep a careful watch on whether the agreement is being adhered to. This will be a form of development in which human rights can be strengthened on both sides and in which my friends on the Israeli Left may perhaps see their dream fulfilled. Everyone is entitled to a homeland! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would like to stress at least three of them: firstly, the continuing colonisation process, both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank. Secondly, the situation of Jerusalem, Al Quds – that is to say, the wish of the Barak government to make the city the indivisible capital of Israel. And, finally, the lack of solutions for the Palestinian refugees living outside their country, who have the right to return to their home. As Minister Sasi says, now Israel has no major reasons for not resuming the negotiations with Syria that they left off in 1996. If these negotiations are successfully settled, we are sure that negotiations between Israel and Lebanon will follow. Meanwhile, Israel does not respect the Accords signed with the representatives of the Palestinian people.</p>

Nevertheless, we know that the history and circumstances of the conflict are dramatic and that, over the years, various initiatives which seemed to open up a future of hope, have ended up being blocked as a result of intransigence, a lack of political will or the short-sightedness of one of the sides involved. This is why serious obstacles to achieving a peace which is just, such as the constant establishment of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory or the lack of respect for what East Jerusalem means to Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims in general, have made the road to peace a difficult one. Peace is a concept which should not be defined as merely the absence of war. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that, this time, the way forward for hope which has opened up after the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum is not closed in the future, the political sensitivity and intelligence of the new Government of the State of Israel, whose security we want to see guaranteed, must come up with measures which are capable of creating a lasting confidence on the Palestinian side, so that the peaceful way forward, recently reopened, reaches its final goal as soon as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The way opened up a month ago by the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum finally puts the Oslo and Wye River Accords back on track. This phase is essential for a fair and lasting settlement of the conflict. The Accords recognise the Palestinians’ right to self-determination, as a State, but also guarantee the right of Israel to live in safety within secure and recognised borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, itself a unique example of cooperation between nations formerly at war, must serve here as a model and as a catalyst, promoting trade with the region and why not, in the longer term, creating an internal market for the whole of the Near East. Did you not speak, Commissioner Patten, of multiplying, revitalising multilateral cooperation in the region? The objective may seem to be a distant one, but it is one worth pursuing.

It does not contain anything new and is insufficient as regards its content. The two parties have agreed on the implementation of commitment which had previously been signed but which had not been followed up. It is not peace, and it is premature to cry victory. Nonetheless, this recent agreement has considerable political significance – it marks the end of the deadlock in the peace process after years of stagnation, even sabotage, by the Netanyahu Government which never accepted the terms of the Oslo Accord. This is why it is important for the European Parliament to consider it favourably and to call on the parties involved to implement it in its entirety and in good faith.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for resolution is balanced and fair. It is a useful reminder of the statement of the principles of the European Parliament on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I am sorry that paragraph 7 of the PSE motion for resolution on the freeze on settlement has not been included in the compromise text. Observation of this condition by Israel is, in fact, essential to establishing confidence. The Palestinian counterpart, however, is found in paragraph 8 in the form of a clear and unambiguous undertaking to fight terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European contribution to peace in the Middle East is expressed not only by means of economic and financial aid, it is also by adhering firmly to the political principles of a fair and lasting solution that we shall ultimately leave a European imprint on the final settlement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The road between Gaza and the West Bank is an example of this. There is, however, a very great deal which remains to be done. Where, for example, settlements are concerned, we want a more powerful wording for draft Amendment No 1. It is very important indeed that it be emphasised that it is Resolution 242 which is the foundation for the whole peace process and that Israel must definitely vacate the areas which have been occupied since 1967. </p>
<p class="contents">An important part of these areas is, of course, Jerusalem. I think it is important to note that Israel, or its predecessors, in fact accepted the principle that Jerusalem is an international concern. When the United Nation’s partitioning plan was accepted, it was also accepted that Jerusalem should be an international city which should not belong to any of the Jewish or Palestinian States decided upon in accordance with the partitioning plan. The EU must persistently emphasise that it is unacceptable for Israel to treat Jerusalem as if it were its own private concern. It is an international interest, not least for the three big world religions. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the matter of the refugees. Through its contributions of one kind or another to the war in Kosovo, the EU has, in practice, accepted a war in order to guarantee that refugees might return to their own land. In Palestine, there are also millions of people outside the region who, in accordance with the United Nations’ Resolution of more than fifty years ago, are entitled to return there. It is absolutely crucial that this principle should be maintained. The people concerned should have the freedom to elect either to return or to receive compensation. Most of them have already found other lives and are certainly unlikely to exercise the right to return to precisely the houses in which they once lived. The principle must, however, still be held to. Otherwise, there is unlikely to be any final resolution of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several speakers: Mr Galeote at the beginning of the debate, and Mr Schori – pointed out that after some rather and difficult, gloomy months and years there was at least a hint of dawn on the horizon. I think that is true, and it was reflected in what most honourable Members said.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course Mr Poos is correct in saying, with all his knowledge and experience, that – and I paraphrase him – ‘it is a little too early to open the champagne’. There is more work to do. We intend to do what we can to assist the process and I want to express once again my gratitude to Ambassador Moratinos for all that he has been doing in the region to contribute a great deal of assistance on the part of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is just worth emphasising once again the strength of our economic relationship. We are, of course, the largest economic partner of Israel, and it is worth recalling as well the total aid to the Palestinians. European Union assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 1994 to 1998 totalled EUR 1.5 billion and European Union assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during the same period totalled approximately EUR 505m. That is a very substantial commitment by any standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Lady who spoke on behalf of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Parties – we know one another from different pasts – referred to the importance of fair as well as open trade between the region and the European Union. When I saw Foreign Minister Levy in New York a couple of weeks ago, I said to him that I did not think that our relationship should be drowned in orange juice – there are important trade issues we have to resolve, of which orange juice is one. There are more comprehensive issues that we have to resolve, and I am sure we should aim to do that in the next few months.</p>
