<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schwaiger, </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here in Strasbourg last Wednesday we had the chance to talk to representatives of the various parties in the elected national parliament of Bosnia‐Herzegovina for the first time in our Delegation for South‐East Europe, led by our most energetic chairman Doris Pack.</p>
<p class="contents">This political dialogue showed us that we can take it as read that we and the Members of Parliament of Bosnia‐Herzegovina are determined to work together and that they place a great deal of trust in us as representatives of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole. We should do justice to this trust and be guided by it in the work we do in the European Parliament, focusing our policies on peace, reconciliation and reconstruction and continuing to implement them consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days Bosnia‐Herzegovina has been hitting the international headlines, and not just because the decision about the status of the city of Brcko has finally been taken. From now on all sections of the population are to be covered by a single municipal and district administration, so as to put a stop to all the conflicts and blockades. The Office of the High Representative has taken on an important role here, organising cooperation, ensuring that refugees return home and promoting peaceful coexistence in this region of Brcko.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the High Representative has done what was necessary and removed the President of Republika Srpska, Mr Poplasen, from office, thereby preventing the destructive forces associated with Milosevic from holding up the reconstruction work started there. The international community is therefore utterly determined to continue with the reconstruction of Bosnia‐Herzegovina and its constituent parts, in other words its entities, and to put a stop to those who oppose the Dayton peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The macro‐financial assistance for Bosnia‐Herzegovina which we are discussing today is an important element in the European Union"s efforts to do its bit for the reconstruction of Bosnia‐Herzegovina and to help the country to help itself. The aim of the financial assistance is to support the economic reform and reconstruction programme for Bosnia‐Herzegovina, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, by means of firm pledges of financing. Back in March 1998 the IMF and the World Bank outlined a macro‐economic programme for Bosnia‐Herzegovina. After our ECOFIN Council in April 1998 also agreed to this EU financial assistance, the Commission stated at the fourth Donors" Conference – supported by myself as the representative of the European Parliament – that it was in principle willing to provide Bosnia‐Herzegovina with macro‐financial assistance amounting to around 50 % of that given by the entire international community. Out of this, EUR 30 million is to be given in loans and EUR 30 million in the form of grants.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proposed financial assistance the European Union hopes to support the implementation of an economic reform programme comprising a series of both macro‐economic and institutional commitments, concerning both the common institutions of Bosnia‐Herzegovina and the institutions of the two entities. Although lasting peace is gaining ground in Bosnia‐Herzegovina, the country"s structures are still fragile and still depend on international support. The most urgently needed structural reforms at this stage are banking reforms, enterprise privatisation and restructuring, reform of the healthcare and pensions system, the introduction of a simplified system of customs tariffs and the liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly of all, Bosnia‐Herzegovina must earn revenue of its own, particularly revenue from customs duties. However, corruption in the tax administration, an upsurge in organised crime and a plethora of cases of fraud mean that the organs of State – government, parliament and the judiciary – and spending controls do not yet work properly. The amendments proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I am now tabling, support the Commission in this action and I would ask for your approval of this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists I should like to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on his excellent, very clear report. It sums up very comprehensively the extremely delicate situation which still prevails in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ways in which the European Union can assist in maintaining what is still a very fragile peace and help to move forward towards the creation of democracy and peaceful cooperation between its different ethnic groups, which we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 60 m of aid being discussed here is a comparatively small sum but, as the rapporteur points out, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been receiving very large sums of money in the wake of the disastrous civil war and financial assistance on that scale is unlikely to continue. It is therefore essential that this money is very carefully targeted and monitored to ensure that it is used to bring about the necessary reforms to enable the country to become self‐sustaining.</p>
<p class="contents">Better infrastructure, efficiently functioning public administration supporting democratic structures and the continued transition to a market economy are vital to achieve this. The PES supports all the amendments to the Commission proposals which will serve to strengthen the monitoring of the use of the money in a country where fraud, corruption and organized crime are, sadly, still part of the legacy of the civil war. All of us in Europe have an interest in helping to improve security, employment and living standards and resettling refugees and displaced persons in a part of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a moral as well as financial imperative to ensure that this macro‐financial assistance is targeted as effectively as possible to achieve these aims in partnership with the IMF and the World Bank. The PES welcomes the full involvement of the European Parliament in this process.</p>

Our friendship is so strong that no party barriers come between us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) Mr President, Mr Schwaiger has once again done some excellent work here and has addressed a great many problems. Perhaps I could look at what might be termed the political side, since this is, after all, one of the trickiest issues. By the way, this is the best proof we could have that Friday sittings are worth attending. Thinking back to all the nonsense that was talked on previous days, I must say that this subject is substantially more important than most of the others that have been discussed.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about one point: the problem of Bosnia is perhaps the most difficult of all for us to deal with, as the crisis there could not be predicted. It was a sudden event which swept over the country, catching it unawares and directly exposing it to an attack from outside, from Serbia. There were further difficulties besides, as demonstrated by events in Brcko, where a problem was once again left unresolved. It is all very well to say that Brcko should be turned into a neutral zone. However, this is not what had been clearly promised, which was that the wishes of the population would be followed. In that case Brcko would obviously have joined the Federation of Bosnia rather than becoming neutral territory, although that would still have been better than handing it straight over to the Serbs, since there are scarcely any Serbs in Brcko. The majority of people there were Muslims and Croats, who certainly had no wish to live under Serbian rule.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also consider that even the dismissal of Mr Poplasen from his post as President of Republika Srpska has yet again shown that the clean‐up operation so vitally necessary if there is to be cooperation has not yet taken place in Republika Srpska. The fact that Mr Karadzic"s cronies continue in power to a certain extent poisons the whole situation. Therefore our task, first and foremost, is to help the present, legitimate government. This also means, of course, helping this legitimate government by setting a good example ourselves. It was most regrettable that a number of the worst cases of corruption in the Commission were related to this very area, and perhaps not enough has yet been done to clear up these cases. We are a long way, after all, from putting the Commission"s house in order and it is high time, given the situation, for this to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, it has to be acknowledged that many of the problems listed here, such as corruption, fraud and crime, actually stem from Republika Srpska and again and again spill over into the territory of the Federation. The latter, which I have frequently visited, enjoys quite a high degree of law and order. It is Republika Srpska which spreads disorder and which is still under totalitarian leadership, whereas the present government in Bosnia, as well as Muslims, Croats and even Serbs, genuinely believe in democracy. Yes, such a thing is possible! The problem is that we have never given them enough support. We could have worked very well with these Serbs, had we decided not to play games over and over again with Karadzic, Vladic and company, whatever their names are.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an absolutely fundamental political problem. We shall have to call upon our Union to pursue a clear and unambivalent policy not just towards Republika Srpska within Bosnia, but also in Serbia itself. There is one point we must grasp, which is that as long as Milosevic is in power there will be no peace, just as there would never have been peace in Germany had Hitler been allowed to continue in power! They are after all broadly similar characters. We must finally resolve to give effective support to those forces existing in Serbia – we have seen them here ourselves on occasion. Only then will we have peace.</p>

I do not do that as a matter of routine but only when it is justified, which is the case here. I readily concur with Mr von Habsburg's description of the political situation in these countries – he knows it much better than I do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus a question of creating democracy in a country which must now rebuild after war and terror have ravaged its people both physically and socially for so long. It is a question of creating political reforms for democracy, stability, a market economy and sustainable growth. It is a question of creating living conditions for the people who live in these areas, and who must both cope with their own everyday lives and deal with displaced persons and returning refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">After all the crises we have now had in the Commission, with fraud and mismanagement of resources, which have been discussed in this Chamber many times, not least in connection with matters involving reconstruction programmes, it is immensely important, indeed a condition, that resources for these programmes should actually be used for the intended purpose and that we achieve the results sought by the programme. This demands proper control of how the money is spent. Since, in the wake of the war, crime and disorder are also rife in the receiving countries, with fraud and corruption as part of everyday life, it is even more important that the money we commit is not subject to mismanagement on the donor's side. It is immensely important, from the point of view of trust towards us as politicians and parliamentarians, that matters now proceed according to acceptable rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to cooperate with other lenders and funding agencies, such as the IMF and the European Investment Bank, and to involve the new institutions, the banking system, the central bank and so forth in Bosnia‐Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Reporting on and monitoring of activities is also absolutely crucial, so that we who are now appropriating funds can ascertain what happens and correct any errors. It is also a good idea to have a clear deadline for when reports and so on are to be presented.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good proposal. It can also be a good reform – everything depends on how it is set up, implemented and controlled.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Posselt </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, even in the peaceful states of Central and Eastern Europe we see that economic and financial assistance have no effect without the rule of law and good governance. But this is particularly the case in a country destroyed by war, where the war may have ended but peace has not yet been achieved. There is crime and corruption everywhere, even in our own countries, but of course it is far worse in a country whose future is something not many people believe in and who therefore feel that they need to feather their own nests quickly before everything falls apart.</p>
<p class="contents">Through statements like those made by Lord Owen, who said that Republika Srpska might be annexed to Serbia after all, we are supporting crime and mismanagement. This destroys confidence that the country of Bosnia‐Herzegovina will continue to exist in the future, and that is dangerous because it could bring all our economic and financial efforts to nothing. I therefore hold the view that we need political stability, and this primarily involves the return of displaced people and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that so far the Commission and the Council have not been able to give me any statistics on how many displaced people and refugees have returned to each entity, so that we could make a scientific comparison of how many have returned to the Muslim Croat Federation and how many, or rather how few, have been able to go back to Republika Srpska – virtually none in the latter case. If we had figures available we would see what the ratio was. Therefore I urgently request that such data be provided to help us assess the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Brcko is concerned, neutrality is certainly better than annexing it to Serbia against the will of the people, but this neutrality can only be a transitional solution. It must be internationally guaranteed. It brings back fateful memories of the Baltic Corridor before the Second World War. We have to recognise that true peace is still a long way off for this country. Step by step we must try to bolster stability, but we should also realise that it will take years, maybe even decades, for normal conditions to be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the Schwaiger report for its practical and critical attitude and also for its endeavours to help people in specific ways and to consolidate administration and the rule of law, without which there will be fresh waves of refugees, and the return of refugees and all the reconstruction work we have done, of which many are justifiably so proud, will immediately come under threat if the highly fragile peace there is destroyed. Dayton was just a first step, and a thoroughly inadequate agreement at that, and we need to make considerable improvements to it here.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span> <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Commission congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, for the excellent report which Parliament is to vote on today, and thanks him for the support he has given to the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing macro‐financial assistance for Bosnia‐Herzegovina amounting to a total of EUR 60 million, consisting of a loan of up to EUR 30 m and a non‐repayable component of up to EUR 30 m. The granting of a non‐repayable component is due to the country"s level of development and will require a special decision from the budgetary authority. To make sure that this assistance is provided in good time, without having to wait for the legal basis to be adopted, the Commission will ask the budgetary authority to consider this decision as a matter of urgency, in line with the strategy pursued by the international donor community and by the European Union in particular after the constitution of the State of Bosnia‐Herzegovina following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in December 1995. The operation is designed to be a one‐off addition to the measures provided for under the PHARE And OBNOVA programmes. The specific objective of the operation proposed is to support efforts to bring about macro‐economic stability and structural reform in Bosnia‐Herzegovina, in the context of the programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Furthermore, at the last meeting of the Peace Implementation Council, held on 15‐16 December in Madrid, ministers recognised that economic reforms, together with the strengthening of the common institutions, are fundamental priorities if the autonomous development of Bosnia‐Herzegovina is to be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the authorities in Bosnia‐Herzegovina concluded a stand‐by agreement with the IMF in May 1998, some progress has been made on fundamental economic reforms. A common currency, the convertible marka, has been adopted, a common state budget has been passed, and budgetary spending by both entities has been strictly kept within the constraints of the revenue available.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January 1999, a single customs code, consistent with European Union rules, came into force, and progress has been made in harmonising the trade regimes of both entities. In addition, a World Bank programme to improve the management of public finances has been completed. Nonetheless, a hefty package of work still remains to be done. Gross domestic product <span class="italic">per capita</span> is estimated at well below pre‐war levels. Overall unemployment is estimated at between 35 and 40 %. Bosnia‐Herzegovina"s external financial situation is still shaky and not enough progress has been made in fundamental sectors such as privatisation, the reform of the banking and payments system and tax reform.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I should like to make a number of comments on the rapporteur"s proposed amendments. The Commission supports Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5. It also shares the concerns expressed in many of the amendments rejected, but at the same time it considers it important to safeguard the effective implementation of the assistance, the integrity of the aims pursued and the exceptional nature of this financial instrument. The implementation procedures have proved their worth in many similar operations managed by the Commission. Making the procedures unduly burdensome could jeopardise the efficacy of the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the Commission intends to guarantee that the macro‐financial assistance complements and is entirely consistent with other forms of Community assistance to Bosnia‐Herzegovina. In particular, it intends to make full use of the advice of CAFAO, the Tax and Customs Assistance Office funded by the European Union, and will give priority to the implementation of measures recommended by the Office to combat fraud and corruption. I would also point out, whilst on this subject, that the macro‐financial assistance provided in the form of a non‐repayable grant and a loan will be paid into an account at the Central Bank, in order to increase its currency reserves and boost the balance of payments. It would be extremely difficult for funds to be embezzled or misused under these circumstances, given also that the use of official reserves is subject to constant supervision by the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes Parliament"s desire to be informed of the conditions laid down for granting this assistance in good time, and it will therefore forward a report on this as soon as possible, as is provided for in any case in the proposal. Nevertheless, in order to negotiate these conditions, which are an essential part of the operation, a certain degree of flexibility is needed and we must comply with any confidentiality requirements which the authorities in the country might impose regarding the substance and timetable of the reforms. The Commission is however prepared to answer any questions Parliament sees fit to ask during the operation and after it has been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission"s eyes it is vital to safeguard the objectives of an operation which is designed to support macro‐economic stability and economic reforms, and to this end the implementation of the assistance needs to be well coordinated with the international financial institutions present in Bosnia‐Herzegovina. Nevertheless, given the exceptional circumstances prevailing in this area, the Commission will remain in close contact with the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia‐Herzegovina, as it already does anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as in other Community operations of a financial nature, the principles of sound and efficient management and rigorous budgetary control will of course be complied with. The Commission will support these principles before the Council, to make sure that they are properly applied in the final decision.</p>

I just have one question regarding Amendment No 11 to Article 5(1)(new): does this also refer to informing the European Parliament before the second tranche of financial assistance is released? We feel it would make sense to draw up a short interim report and only to proceed further once you have informed us and we have been able to assure you of our further support.</p>

As for the amendment Mr Schwaiger is referring to, that is No 11, the Commission does not feel it can accept it as such but intends to take account of it in a Commission statement to the Council of Ministers, which will of course be made in public. The reason why we are unwilling to accept the amendment as such is that the procedure proposed could present risks for the efficiency of the operation. Nonetheless, given the exceptional political and social circumstances prevailing in Bosnia‐Herzegovina at the present time, the Commission will keep the competent bodies of both Parliament and the Council regularly informed of developments, including the actual execution of the assistance programme, which I think the honourable Member particularly emphasised. That is all I can tell you about this matter for the moment.</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of how much I value the fact that you all work with me to help things run smoothly and to carry out the good and fruitful work we do at these Friday morning sittings. In all seriousness, allow me to say how I feel and to express my gratitude, on behalf of the House, to all those who collaborate with us, since this has been a week of very intense work.</p>
<p class="contents">This week we approved the amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure by a vast majority. These amendments will not enter into force until all the Member States have approved the amendments made to the Treaties in Amsterdam. This means that, as we are coming to the end of this parliamentary term, we have almost completely prepared the Rules of Procedure of this House for its next term. I must say that I felt as if we were planting a tree, that we had stopped concentrating on our day‐to‐day work for a few moments so that we could also take a responsible look at the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope – and I am sure, as you all are – that this tree will bear fruit and will shelter the Members who, as representatives of the people of Europe, will hold these seats in the next parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I close the sitting, Mr Rübig wishes to speak on a point of order.</p>

I have had two groups of visitors who were subjected to a great deal of extremely annoying red tape. They were searched and made to pay fines.
