On the one hand, international competition remains extremely distorted. The market, which is characterised by artificially low prices, in particular from Korea, can still only be described as extremely anti-competitive. On the other hand, the demands made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 14 December of last year have so far, either, not been met at all, or, only to an insufficient extent. It remains unclear how the European shipbuilding industry can be supported so as further to improve its international competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains unclear how rigorously the Commission has responded to Parliament's call for a dispute settlement procedure to be initiated with the Republic of Korea before the World Trade Organisation. The decisions made so far in this respect by the Commission, and also by the Council, have been inconsistent and illogical in important areas. On the one hand, they have established that Korea has clearly violated the agreements made; on the other, they have so far neglected to take immediate and appropriate action against this. This can only be to the detriment of European shipyards. Only in May 2001, when the situation is examined more closely, will it be recognised that the Union's shipyards have been at the mercy of persistently unfair competition for almost half a year. This means additional burdens and dangers in an already complicated situation. It may be disastrous for individual companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this acute situation, competition is being distorted and livelihoods are being threatened, and the European Union risks suffering serious strategic damage if action is not taken more quickly and more systematically against obvious unfair practices. The course of events so far really does seem rather odd.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to draw a comparison between this and a sporting competition. How do you think a competitor feels who has just recovered from a serious illness and is sent into the boxing ring? There he comes up against a tough opponent who, despite having been proven guilty of taking drugs several times, still has not been banned. On the contrary, the prizes are increasing. This is an opponent who already habitually hits below the belt, while the referee looks on indifferently and the judges argue about what the drug-taker's illegal punches are worth – full or half points! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Civil sector shipbuilding in Europe still employs 250 000 people, and it is a high-tech industry. Shipbuilding is an industry for developed countries, not an industry for low-wage countries. Finally, public aid for shipbuilding is now no longer possible in Europe, as was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 5 December. Yet the same Council gave the Commission a mandate to propose to the next Council in May 2001 a mechanism affording protection against unfair competition from Korean shipyards. Personally, I feel we are heading for a conflict with Korea, and that no solution will be found between now and then.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, finally, to remind you that the Council asked the Commission to look into the possibility of facilitating access to aid for research and development. In such circumstances, our discussions will focus on whether shipbuilding will be taken into consideration in the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme (FRDP). The fifth programme actually contained a line on “land transport and marine technologies” including the draft presented by Commissioner Busquin, based on focussing resources. This line no longer exists. Of course, the industry expressed its concern to me, in my capacity as rapporteur, and to many of my fellow Members.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, then, I would like to ask you in the strongest terms, Mr Monti, to please outline just what you intend to propose, in response to the requests from the Council of 5 December, in order to facilitate the return to forms of aid for research and development, to support and undertake commercial measures against unfair competition by Korea and, finally, to propose an appropriate temporary aid mechanism, while awaiting the outcome of the procedure in the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask you to bear with me, however, if I concentrate exclusively on the situation of the shipyards in eastern Germany. In the image of the boxing ring, which Mr Gomolka used, the east German shipyards must, in addition, climb into the ring wearing handcuffs. They are facing rigid restrictions on production capacity and, of course, I know that these were the condition for high subsidies in the nineties. But firstly, they are managed bureaucratically and secondly, no account is taken of the fact that these shipyards do in fact also continue to invest during the general process of rationalisation. The resulting growth in productivity triggers further cuts in the workforce. The Commission has very good statistical data about the dramatic situation in eastern Germany, Commissioner. It is one thing to read that one in every three people there is seeking work, however, and quite another perhaps to experience it first-hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am very well aware that since 1990 the Union has acted in great solidarity with east Germany and that the Commission has done a great deal. Of course, the Federal German Government is also called upon to act here. But in the specific case of the shipbuilding industry, the decision lies, above all, with the Commission. I think that the Treaty of Amsterdam offers sufficient room for manoeuvre for political action to be taken and for the saving clause on capacity restrictions in the Treaty to be used in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is necessary, firstly, to make the quotas more flexible so that they are no longer annual but are applied for the remaining five years; secondly to factor-in the impact of rationalisation and take this into account and, thirdly – and I really support this point – to reintroduce general production aid for as long as South Korea causes these gross distortions of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by emphasising that the Commission is fully aware of the importance of European shipbuilding and of the specific difficulties encountered by many shipyards. We are fully aware of the nature of these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The expansion of South Korean shipyards, which are already heavily in debt, has been made possible by further loans from financial institutions which do not operate under market conditions.<span class="bold"> </span>Various forms of indirect State intervention have enabled South Korea to keep capacities in production<span class="bold"> </span>which, had the normal commercial criteria been applied, would have had to be reduced in order to be able to meet effective market requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">This surplus capacity is acting like a dead weight on the world shipbuilding market and even threatening the future of some European yards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that unfair competition practices in the international shipbuilding sector need to be tackled by means of appropriate mechanisms. This means, first and foremost, through talks and, as a last resort, in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Commissioner Lamy is in a better position than I am to give you detailed information about the current state of these talks, I can assure you that the Commission is continuing to make every endeavour to negotiate a solution to the problem. It is, of course, willing to raise the issue in the World Trade Organisation and is currently making the necessary preparations to initiate the procedure. Commission Lamy made this quite clear to the South Korean authorities during his meeting with them in mid-February.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the current international talks fail to lead to a solution, the Commission has undertaken to refer the matter to the Council by 1 May and to propose a temporary<span class="bold"> </span>protective<span class="bold"> </span>support<span class="bold"> </span>mechanism. This does not mean reintroducing the former provisions on operating aid<span class="bold"> </span>laid down in Article 3 of Regulation 1540/98.</p>
<p class="contents">The third report from the Commission to the Council on the situation of world shipbuilding states clearly that the operating aid arrangements under said regulation have not provided a solution to the international trade problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely the typical negative consequences of operating aid that have led the Commission to express a generally negative opinion on this type of aid. Shipbuilding was the last industrial sector in which this type of aid was still authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">You are, of course, aware that the Commission favours those types of aid in which the distortion of competition caused by a case of State aid is offset by a positive incentive effect. This is why, in its decision of 29 November, the Commission decided not to extend the operating aid provided for in Article 3 of Regulation 1540/98.</p>
<p class="contents">The third report from the Commission to the Council on the situation of world shipbuilding, which I have just mentioned,<span class="bold"> </span>confirmed that contract-related aid involved a range of negative effects on the single market. This aid was burdensome, unfocused<span class="bold"> </span>and distorted intra-Community trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is considering very carefully the form that the temporary mechanism should take if we cannot reach a satisfactory solution through talks with South Korea. On the one hand, we must steer clear of the problems we have encountered in the past and, on the other, we must find a useful instrument which will supplement both the current international talks and a WTO procedure, should this prove necessary, enabling Community shipyards to compete on an equal footing under standard conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This mechanism should specifically discourage the unfair practices of South Korea for as long as the WTO procedure takes to reach its conclusion and target those market segments in which European industry has suffered directly as a result of the unfair trade practices of South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are working on the preparation of the proposal with all speed. We will make every endeavour to ensure that it is ready within the timeframe set by the Council, should it be needed. Parliament will, of course, be kept informed of our progress. In the meantime, there must not be any doubt as to the Commission's determination to take up a position in defence of those Community shipyards which are suffering the consequences of unacceptable international trade practices which distort competition.</p>

<p class="contents">May I add here that R&amp;D is of vital importance if European industry is to be able to tackle the competitive challenges it faces in the medium to longer term. It therefore seems appropriate for the Commission to examine whether any adaptation of the existing rules in this area is needed. This work has already started in collaboration with industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that the Commission recently adopted – Mr Caudron made a reference to that – its proposal for the Framework Programme on research and innovation for 2002 to 2006. The proposal opens up the possibility of supporting shipbuilding-related research and innovation within several of the new proposed actions. Examples are: "flexible and intelligent production systems, included in the third priority theme; intelligent transport, included in the sixth priority theme; or under the heading 'anticipation of scientific and technological needs of the Union'".</p>
<p class="contents">I note in this connection that R&amp;D aid and other types of aid allowed under the shipbuilding regulation – because, as you know, there are several – will not result in the same level of aid as offered by operating aid. It appears, however, that the available measures concerning R&amp;D aid have not been fully explored and exploited. I therefore believe that Member States and industry should make a bigger effort there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I shall now turn to the last point raised regarding the production restriction on the yards of the former East Germany. I would like to start by explaining the origins of the capacity restraints and the reasons why they have been imposed. Capacity restraint was imposed on the yards of the former Democratic Republic of Germany by a special Council directive, adopted in 1992, which contained a derogation from the prevailing regulations on operating aid applicable at that time to Community shipyards. The aim of the derogation directive was to make it possible for the yards in question to carry out all-embracing, urgent restructuring and thus become competitive on the market. To this end, these yards received ongoing financial aid. It must be stressed that the aid was intended to ensure the survival of the yards in question, which would not have been able to operate on Western markets without carrying out a far-reaching restructuring process. The granting of substantial aid, however, required compensation measures to be adopted in order to offset the distortive effect of the aid on competition. This is why the Council imposed capacity restraints on the yards concerned during that period, precisely to offset the distortion of competition caused by the large amounts of aid granted. The capacity restraints were established for a period of ten years, which is until the end of 2005. My departments have the task of monitoring observance of these restraints.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative framework applicable to the restraints, however, does stipulate that, after the first five years, a Member State may request that the Commission bring the restraints in question to an end or review them. With regard to the question of whether the Commission intends to avail itself of the possibility provided for by the legislation in question to assess whether a review of the capacity restraints would be justified, I would stress that the Commission's leeway in a decision on this matter is extremely limited. The Commission is bound by the provisions of the directive in question, according to which, when it assesses whether any revision of the capacity restraints is possible and justified, it has to take into account the existing balance between supply and demand in the shipping industry at world level. I am willing to examine the possibility provided for by the prevailing legislation of reviewing the current restraints. I am willing to examine any proposals made in this area. The issue will have to be carefully examined, however, in the light of the relevant legislation and the Commission's monitoring practices. We are aware of the fact that the East German shipyards' share of the European market fell from 11.3% in 1994 to 6.9% in 1998. I must point out, however, that this is not so much the result of the imposition of capacity restraints as the general trend of the shipbuilding industry in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a still a world leader in top-of-the-range cruise shipbuilding. Since the mid-nineties, there has been a considerable increase in demand for cruise ships, which represent a large part of the total value of European shipbuilding. East German yards, however, produce other types of ships such as portacontainers. Therefore, alongside the increase in production of top-of-the-range cruise ships in Europe, the share occupied by East German yards has fallen. The fundamental question would therefore not appear to be the quantities produced so much as the yards' specialisation in certain types of production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, however, our shipbuilding industry is, unfortunately, in a very bad way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the issue we are dealing with today is by no means a recent one. Quite the opposite. For more than two years we have debated and condemned the unfair practices, originating mainly from Asia, which our shipbuilders are being subjected to.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment it is exclusively the Commission’s responsibility to define the defence mechanisms for protecting our shipbuilding industry, or what remains of it, in the face of Korea’s unfair practices. After so much time during which the European sector has been decimated, while people signed friendly agreements, carried out consultations and held meetings, it is now time to act decisively. The Commission must adopt a strong position on this issue and unequivocally defend our industry, by approving, as soon as possible, an ambitious plan which provides aid for operations, research and development and, of course, environmental aid. Only through a raft of measures of this type can we protect and compensate this important industry which, on more than one occasion, has felt abandoned by the Community authorities. This would also send a clear and powerful message to the Government of South Korea and would possibly persuade that government, in the medium term, to change its current policy of commercial dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must point out that it is our duty to guarantee an atmosphere of fair competition on a world scale so that this industry, on which so many families in Europe, Spain and in my region, the Basque Country, depend, may move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, because although we are about to invoke the WTO dispute procedure, it is an unwieldy procedure and we may lose capacity in the interim. Secondly, because although I can understand the context and rationale for withdrawing the shipbuilding intervention fund, I am nevertheless convinced that we need to have structural measures, particularly in the areas of research, construction of oil and drilling vessels, chemical carriers and cruise liners.</p>
<p class="contents">While the second report clearly outlines the inadequacies of China's development in this area – poor management, corruption etc. – while they are outside the WTO, I do not think we can be sanguine about the potential that they might develop. Therefore we need to take action very quickly. In a constituency where we have lost 10 000 shipbuilding jobs in the last ten years, I welcome the measures that you have outlined tonight but hope that we can move faster and further in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disguised cross-subsidies of the Korean Republic, its monetary depreciation and its accounting systems, which are not transparent and do not respect internationally agreed principles, continue to harm the whole of the world market and equally affect Japan, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the international agreement in the form of an agreed minute between the European Community and the Government of the Korean Republic has not persuaded Korea to fulfil its commitments, since the mission of antidumping experts sent by the Commission has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and while these Korean violations continue, as well as condemning the situation to international bodies such as the WTO, the OECD and the IMF, we ask the Council and the Commission to either once again extend or implement state aid linked to contracts, or to urgently establish other adequate mechanisms, in order to slow down our continuous loss of jobs and in legitimate defence of our shipbuilding industry. This must be done now. It is all very well to negotiate, but the best way to persuade the other party to take us seriously is by making it feel that we are able to defend our interests and are prepared to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is something else, however, of vital importance to this Parliament: is this unfair competition now being introduced here? A few days ago our shipyard was to close because it failed to win the contract to build two ships. The company made a very interesting statement after Harland &amp; Wolff were turned down.

I do not believe that this will be the last time that we discuss this matter in this Parliament. Mr Monti, you are quite right to say that shipbuilding, research and development and intelligent maritime transport are our future. I would so like to believe this, from our position in the here and now. We know that shipbuilding is the last industrial sector to be subsidised. We know that this is an anathema to you, and actually it is to us too, but the shipbuilding industry needs help quickly, help which is relevant to its current situation, not long-term subsidies – please do not misunderstand me – but financial help until the market has returned to normality.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just about Europe any more; nor is it just about South Korea. I know from my own experience – I have just been to China and Hong Kong – that other nations are observing us and that our attitude is setting them a bad example. We, therefore, need to make positive statements, redouble our efforts and implement our shipbuilding standards and our intelligent maritime know-how with conviction. In actual fact this is not just about a few jobs; it is not just about a sector of the economy whose difficulties we have, after all, been able to overcome so successfully up until now. It is in actual fact about the new image of a modern European Union. That is why we are asking you so urgently to provide help. I have got to know you personally, Mr Monti, through our discussions on the maritime sector and have come to hold you in high regard.

There is not much disagreement among us. First of all, I share fully in the deprecation and concern about Korean behaviour. I said this very clearly and that is why we are applying pressure. There is the preparation of the WTO action and there is the preparation of the temporary focused support mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, and several speakers made this point, the system that we had in place until the end of last year was not really a good one. Why? It was unhelpful vis-à-vis the Korean threat and harmful to our own single market. The fact that it was unhelpful relative to the Korean threat is more than demonstrated by the facts. The Korean threat has persisted in spite of the contract-related operating aid. This has brought about major distortions within the single market and I found expressed in very different ways and words the concern about this adverse impact within the single market by a wide range of speakers from Mr Paisley to Mr Paasilinna.</p>
<p class="contents">A second theme that clearly emerged is that there must be a number of measures to support shipbuilding in Europe. I agree with the remarks to that effect made by several Members and I would like to thank in particular Mrs Langenhagen for her kind words of appreciation. All the attention has been focused on contract-related aid which is no longer there. Let us have a look at the list of those other forms of aid providing an incentive effect to EU shipyards which are still there after 1 January 2001 under Council Regulation 1540: aid for environmental protection in line with the general Community guidelines for such aid, aid for research and development in line with the general Community framework for such aid and I have already underlined this, aid for innovation which is not allowed in any other industrial sector except the automobile sector, regional investment aid for upgrading and modernising existing yards, but not involving the creation of new capacity, subject to certain caps below the normal regional aid ceilings, aid for rescue and restructuring in line with the general Community guidelines for such aid, subject to certain stricter provisions, aid for partial and total closures contingent on genuine and irreversible reductions of capacity. In addition to these forms of aid, aid in the form of credit facilities for shipowners in accordance with OECD rules will also continue to be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as I said, we are exploring the ways in which further, more intensive use of existing possibilities for aid could be obtained. That goes equally for national aid for research and development as well as possible Community funding measures. We can conclude that the previous system was both unhelpful for its declared objective, that is Korea, and vastly harmful within the single market. It had to be discontinued. It has been discontinued. This does not mean that the Korean problem is being ignored. We are working very hard on it both in terms of a strong negotiating posture and in terms of preparing, if necessary, the introduction of a temporary defence mechanism which, being more focused, would also be more productive than the old-fashioned system that has been scrapped as it had to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
