<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 6 July, this House will decide whether to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the general budget for the 1998 financial year. As it is almost a year since the new Prodi Commission took up its duties, with the lofty promise of pursuing a policy of zero-tolerance towards fraud in dealings with the European tax-payer’s money, this budgetary discharge has special significance.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is the new Commission’s first opportunity to show how seriously it is taking this fresh start. On 13 April, Parliament postponed the decision on granting discharge for the 1998 financial year, at the same time citing 17 conditions that the Commission was to fulfil by 15 May. These conditions corresponded in large measure to the demands contained in the report by the Court of Auditors, such as the commitment to ultimately arrive at a positive statement of assurance. </p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors declined, for the fifth time in succession, to provide an assurance that the Commission’s handling of the finances for the 1998 financial year had been careful and economical. In addition, they demanded measures for dealing with the unfinished business of the three notorious fraud cases concerning Fléchard, ECHO and MED, and for issuing penalties in respect of them. The Commission was criticised for being slow to produce documents and information, and likewise, there was criticism of the lack of transparency and independence as regards disciplinary procedures. Since the Commission had at least fulfilled some of the conditions within the period stipulated, and the appointment of a new Secretary-General of the Commission had signalled a fresh start on the personnel front, I moved in my follow-up report that discharge be granted, or at least I recommended that the Commission recover the funds from the Fléchard and ECHO cases, which are estimated to total approximately 17 million ecus, for the EU’s coffers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Fléchard case should be kept open since a new state of affairs came about at the end of May, due, in particular, to the stand taken by the Court of Auditors. On 27 June 2000, a majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control rejected the call for the money to be recovered. If the House fails to bring about a change of heart here – and I would urge the honourable members to give me their backing – then this money will be lost to EU coffers.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe these comments alone ought to be enough to inspire the Commission to take action on its own account to recoup the funds. What is more, it would be extremely easy in the Fléchard case, for this firm appears to still do good business with the Commission. The Commissioner for the Budget informed us on 15 June that up until 1996, a further three contracts were concluded with Fléchard. My more probing question as to how much the Fléchard firm received in Community subsidies for exports to third countries has failed so far to elicit a response from the Commissioner for the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you once again, Madam Commissioner, whether it is true that the Fléchard firm received around FF 29 million for export reimbursements in 1996 alone, around FF 105 million in 1997, and FF 72 million in 1998? Why did you not provide us with this information earlier? Are you unwilling to cooperate or did your own colleagues leave you in the dark? I read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung this morning that you wrote to Mr Schmidhuber, the former Commissioner for the Budget. I am certain you will be hearing from him shortly.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But Mrs Schreyer, I would very much like to have heard from you, rather than the press, as to when you are actually going to respond to my questions. When are you going to provide us with the figures that you promised more than a month ago to the Committee on Budgetary Control? Do you still stand by your statement that at the time, there were no grounds for involving the Fléchard firm, even though Commissioner Schmidhuber had raised the same question? Have you ever asked your fellow Commissioner Mr Lamy why none of Mr Schmidhuber’s representatives were invited to the meeting on 7 January 1994 in his office? I have also put this question to Mr Lamy in writing but have not received an answer. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, I do not expect you to answer my questions any differently to the way in which you answer those put to you by Mrs Morgan, for example, who, as I have now seen, received detailed answers from you on 23 June, or do you perhaps apply different standards to the way you answer letters from delegates?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Stonewalling and appeasement do not, I feel, constitute a sound strategy. It is not just the European citizen that rightly asks <span class="italic">cui bono? (</span>what is the good of this<span class="italic">). </span>We expect you to be consistent as regards the promised changes to the disciplinary procedures and the reorganisation of internal financial control. This must not lead to a de facto abolition of financial control on account of decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is recommended that the Commission be granted discharge for the 1998 financial year. However, as I see it, this discharge implies a weighty responsibility on the part of the Commission. I can only hope that you give Parliament’s new act of faith due recognition, and would urge you to do so. </p>

There has been a great deal of speculation in the run-up to the grant of discharge. I would like again to make it clear beyond doubt that to me, and, almost certainly, the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control, this was never about having a trial of strength with the Commission, or about weakening it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have always recognised that the current Commission can only be held responsible to an extent for the mistakes of the past. After all, the current Commission only took up office in the summer of 1999 and we are examining the 1998 financial year. On the other hand though, this discharge can definitely be regarded as a test of the Commission’s willingness and ability to undertake reform. The Commission must also be given the opportunity, in the eyes of the public, to demonstrate that it is capable of tackling poor management and ensuring that corrective measures are taken within an appropriate timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we proposed postponement and requested an action plan in April of this year. We were waiting for a clear signal that there would be a shift to greater accountability and better management, because EU external aid is highly significant. It accounts for approximately 55% of international development aid. I am now in a position to assess this action plan and have to say that after April of this year, this plan and cooperation with the Commission stepped up the pace of the reforms already introduced within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We found the Commission and its officials to be extremely willing to cooperate as regards the development fund, and we therefore have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending that this House grant discharge, because we believe that the right lessons have been learnt from past mistakes. That said, I would stress again that it was right to move and decide on postponement.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed Commissioners have since publicly acknowledged that there were major problems in this area. For example, on 15 May of this year, Commissioner Nielson told the Financial Times that the Commission machine was never constructed to deliver development assistance. It was designed for producing directives, regulations, conducting trade negotiations, and to facilitate political relations between the EU States. He said it does not work for development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On 16 May of the same year, Commissioner Patten informed the House that there were over EUR 21 billion outstanding commitments awaiting payments, and that, in other words, there was an enormous disparity between payment appropriations and commitment appropriations. He said this was an embarrassingly large figure and that the Commission wanted to devolve more responsibility to delegations, and where possible, to national authorities in the field, so as to improve financial management.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would stress again that I believe our action plan is heading in the right direction in this very respect and that it will enable us – Parliament and the Commission that is – to jointly take more responsibility for this area and to ensure that there is better management. But Parliament must also take it upon itself to behave more responsibly from the outset during the forthcoming discussions on the budget, i.e. it must produce better planning in these areas from the outset and not just see its responsibility as being to adopt the budget and monitor the financial year at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Strictly speaking, we must now introduce a monitoring process for all areas so as to ensure that we no longer have to face problems of the kind that cropped up in the 1998 financial year. We take it as read that we have done the necessary groundwork to this end.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I would like to reinforce the point that in future, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control expect to receive a six-monthly report from the Commission – indeed we have already been promised one – and that this close cooperation will enable us to simplify matters for the 1999 financial year and, I feel it is safe to say, for the 2000 financial year, and we will no longer be forced to use deferral as a means of bringing pressure to bear. However, I would emphasise, on behalf of the entire Committee on Budgetary Control, that this deferral was an important step towards accepting joint responsibility for the budget and making a joint declaration to the effect that we want to strengthen the European institutions and leave the European tax-payer in no doubt as to the fact that their money is being put to good use, that we are handling payments responsibly and are monitoring the Commission responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But, and this brings me to my final point, I would also like once again to make it clear, as I started to earlier, that the debate about budgetary control and the budget must lead to a strengthening of the European institutions and not to weakening on both sides. I therefore also believe that in future, the Committee on Budgetary Control is going to have to concentrate much harder on the essential guidelines and not get so bogged down in the detail. I think we will be able to work well together with the Commission in this respect.</p>

I will make no bones about the fact that as rapporteur, I feel that if we are to take the discharge procedure seriously, we should not use discharge reports to fulfil additional requests, by way of a kind of safety net. Christmas is not for six months. Therefore we should only concentrate on the requests that were actually made. Both texts – that of 13 April and this one – must be read in conjunction with each other as a contribution to Parliament’s own reform process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What were the main shortcomings? Firstly, an unacceptably high level of so-called direct contracts or ‘private procedures’, which jeopardises the administrative culture because it means that there is no longer anyone looking into whether we could get better value for money. We are aware that steps have been taken that will hopefully bring about a change in this situation before long.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is an unacceptably high level of inventory losses. Thank God it has not all been stolen, rather the money cannot be traced because of an antiquated inventory system. An electronic inventory system is in its early stages and we intend to enquire how this inventory system is working in practice in the course of future discharge procedures.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, promotions were not being awarded in accordance with legally watertight criteria. The Bureau has taken steps to prevent such things from happening in future. Here too we have yet to see how this new procedure will work out in practice.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm that the Secretary-General of Parliament has provided all the information requested, as he did in April. I am therefore in favour, as I was in April, of granting discharge. A broad majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control has signed up to this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In Recital 33 of the April motion on Parliament’s grant of discharge, the discharge was linked with the Court of Auditor’s report on the finances of the groups, although everyone knows that only the groups themselves are responsible for their financial affairs. Yes indeed, these are public funds and so they must be accounted for. Although one can understand the attitude of the Court of Auditors, which only cooperates with Parliament as an institution and has therefore failed to cite the names of individual groups associated with specific shortcomings, I still feel that we should discuss this with the Court of Auditors so as to agree a different arrangement for the future. As a member of my group, I, for one, would not wish to be arrested for the financial misdemeanours of other groups. I believe the members of the other groups would feel exactly the same. I therefore think we should talk to the Court of Auditors about this, with a view to devising a more pragmatic reporting procedure for the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I was quite amazed to hear that the groups are no longer allowed to sweep certain abuses under the carpet, for fear of being seen as birds of a feather that stick together. I believe that any attempt to put all this off or suggestion that we should wait another year until everything has sorted itself out, would be doomed. The issue would catch up with us again sooner than we might think.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is quite remarkable, to my mind, that some groups did not keep their promise to the Bureau to publicise the reports by independent auditors. Of course they were not obliged to do this, and rightly so, but they did promise after all. All the more reason why it should strike me that one group is financing a foundation from its funds (i.e. the EU’s funds) which has a value of EUR 10.3 million on the stock exchange, under Luxembourg law. The law of Luxembourg is not particularly transparent and I feel we are entitled to expect such practices to cease. The real sting in the tail is that the group involved was the one that pushed for Parliament to defer its grant of discharge in April, in line with the German principle that there should be no holds barred on the information front. I am certain that they only did it so that we could all give in-depth consideration to these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is our second debate on granting discharge to the Commission for the 1998 financial year. On 13 April, Parliament decided by a majority to postpone the discharge and ask the Commission to supply further reports and information. Naturally the Commission abided by Parliament’s wishes and on 11 May it submitted the following documents, among others: the Financial Controller’s report on the corrections made to ex-ante controls, a report on the conclusions drawn from the investigative committee into customs procedures, a report and overview in connection with the contracts of scientific visitors, a report on the number of disciplinary proceedings associated with financial irregularities undertaken since 1998 and the outcome thereof.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made it known that it has taken certain measures, with the aid of OLAF, among others, and that it has set up certain action plans in a binding manner and taken the first steps towards implementing the European Development Fund, for example. Although the Court of Auditors had granted the Commission a statement of assurance (albeit restricted) for implementation, the Committee on Budgetary Control, and specifically the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, were not satisfied with this, instead they wanted and called for more steps to be taken to improve the outcome. I can say without hesitation that the action plan, which was not just drawn up at Parliament’s request, indeed we actually enlisted Parliament’s cooperation, will serve to increase the transparency and efficiency of external aid. I would particularly like to thank those who were themselves working on this issue at the time, for their cooperation, and to reaffirm the Commission’s promise to report every six months on the implementation of the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report on the implementation of the 1998 budget, the European Court of Auditors had granted the Commission a statement of assurance for the revenue side of the budget and also for the implementation of commitment appropriations, but not for the implementation of payments from the budget. The number of errors committed in the implementation of the budget is too high. The Commission, and particularly myself as Commissioner for the budget, are completely in agreement with the Court of Auditors and Parliament on this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission has already instigated, or rather, adopted, a number of measures to improve the implementation of the budget and reduce, in fact avoid, errors. Firstly we need error prevention measures, such as – to quote but one example – a measure to reduce the number of invitation to tender and award procedures for external aid – be it the PHARE, MEDA or other programmes – from the 80 different procedures we have had up until now (would you believe?) to 40. The reduction of errors also entails better monitoring, which is what the Commission’s administrative reforms are largely designed to achieve. In future, the individual administrations that actually spend European money will have more personnel at their disposal for monitoring purposes, and they will also be able to inspect the monitoring systems in the Member States more effectively..</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Reducing errors also involves taking effective punitive measures, making demands for the return of funds, and instigating the necessary disciplinary proceedings in the event of conscious violation of official regulations. I would remind you again that my colleague Mr Kinnock is to submit a draft on the reform of disciplinary proceedings before the summer recess.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The present report is critical of current financial control because ex-ante control is said not to have denied any requests for payment. However, that is no indication as to whether financial control does or does not work. I would again point out that even the Court of Auditors has said that the errors it uncovered could not have been detected ex-ante, and the Commission has taken this to mean that we must substantially reinforce ex-post control, by setting up an independent revision service, for example.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has other priorities besides improving financial management, avoiding errors and delays, for example, and improving the efficiency with which funds in short supply are employed, because it is also absolutely intent on fighting fraud.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This concerns the future and the past. I repeat: the Commission has nothing to hide, and so I will also address the questions the House has raised in connection with the Fléchard case. The Court of Auditors has reviewed the decision taken by the offices of the Commission in 1994, i.e. six years ago. The Commission set out to ensure that the report and the response from the Commission, which also details the sequence of events, would not be kept secret or confidential but would be officially available, and indeed they can now be called up on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, it is still a moot point in the debate between the Court of Auditors, as to whether the Commission is entitled, or perhaps even obliged, to apply the principle of proportionality when fixing financial penalties. The current Commission takes the view that it is entitled to do so. Whilst the Court of Auditors considers that only the courts can apply the principle of proportionality, we believe that this is a general administrative principle. The former Commission felt the same and I would like to quote what Mr Schmidhuber, the erstwhile Commissioner for the budget and financial control, had to say on the Fléchard case. He wrote: “In the opinion of the Financial Controller, this does not rule out reaching a negotiated solution with regard to the principle of proportionality”. Therefore, there is agreement on this point, and, at the same time, the Commission, for its part, suggested that it would have been worthwhile investigating in more detail at the time, why the exported butter was diverted from its destination in Russia and ended up being sold in Poland. As to whether we should have demanded the return of the money, I would again point out that this depended on legal proceedings before the Irish High Court. This culminated in a legally valid settlement, which is something the present Commission is also bound by of course.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must uphold the principles and rules of legality in the current fight against fraud and in the efforts being made to shed light on cases from previous years. The same applies to information issues. If OLAF is asked, in preliminary investigations taking place at Member State level, to pass on information for reasons of investigation secrecy, at an appointed time, then this is a binding legal basis for OLAF. This applies to the Director of OLAF as it does to the Commission. In this connection, I would again point out that OLAF is independent where investigations are concerned and it was this very House that insisted on this being so at the drafting of the corresponding legal basis. This means that OLAF is also independent with regard to reporting procedures and that we still need an answer to the question as to whether information belonging to OLAF can be published by the Director, in full implementation of his responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the question as to whether further contracts were concluded with the Fléchard firm, I have advised the committee that for its part, the Commission can say that there were further contracts in the sphere of invitation to tender procedures, and concerning the question as to whether export contracts were concluded at national level or whether export business was conducted, I would point out that the payment of individual recipients throughout the agricultural sector can only take place at Member State level. This follows from the fact that the payments offices are responsible for payments. The Commission can apply for access to the data pursuant to a regulation, and is able to investigate which payments go where.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel I should also point out that Regulation 2390/1999 states that the Commission safeguards the confidentiality and security of electronic data transmitted by the Member States. The Commission would be more than willing, with the committee’s approval, to ask the Member States to duly respond, that is, to grant the necessary permission for data to be passed on.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the principles to do with passing on information also feature in the agreement between Parliament and the Commission on the transfer of information. This agreement should provide a clear basis for this important aspect of relations between Parliament and the Commission, and consequently, it should also form a sound basis for the procedures pertaining to the discharge process. I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who have contributed enormously, not only to the report, but also to the results, the assessments, the observations, and, above all, to the many proposals for improvement and the challenges we have faced. The Commission will implement the concrete measures of the aforementioned action plan and the comprehensive steps of Commission reform, as well as set up an independent audit service and carry out the audit recommendation to the letter. It will be rigorous in reforming the disciplinary procedures, building OLAF up in staffing and operational terms and implementing the strategy for combating fraud with the aid of comprehensive legislation and stringent and reinforced cooperation with the Member States and other States, with the clear aim of restoring the confidence of the population in the sound management of European finances, first and foremost in conjunction with the European Parliament and the other institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He used his contribution as one of Parliament’s rapporteurs as an opportunity for polemics. Since I have no wish to involve myself in polemics, I most certainly would not wish to remind Mr Kuhne that his European party is happy for large numbers of staff to be funded by their own group. I do not wish to go any deeper into this, but he ought to have mentioned it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">All will become clear as to why I requested the floor. Mr President, I urge you to clarify, via the Bureau of the European Parliament, to what extent a rapporteur of this Parliament is allowed to include personal polemics in his or her report. I think this is irresponsible, and if we want to maintain a common style in this House, and eliminate abuses – which are also perpetrated within our groups – something I wholeheartedly embrace, then this must be done in a spirit of cooperation and not using polemics in the way that Mr Kuhne just has! I urge you to have the Bureau look into this matter. </p>

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I should like first of all to point out that there has been considerable development in relation to the report on which we are to give our opinion. Let me remind you that the basic position of the Committee on Foreign Affairs was that we should look resolutely to the future, give ourselves the resources for a practicable policy and, in any case, also give ourselves, i.e. Parliament, real resources to monitor the action undertaken on behalf of the Commission, particularly as regards expenditure of the type we discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">We noted that Mr Prodi’s statement was indeed very positive in this respect. He announced that collaboration with Parliament would be a fresh collaboration. As time has passed, we have observed that this collaboration is indeed in operation. Many Commissioners have had no trouble in appearing before our committees in order to answer questions, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We also thought it would be rather clumsy of the committee to hold the current Commission responsible for the attitudes of previous Commissions. On the other hand, it is also obvious that we are continuing to demand that the present Commissioners show the utmost transparency with regard to Parliament. I think this is essential and indeed I believe it is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to say that, in the context of this Commission, we feel that Parliament will have to take firm control of OLAF because this is in fact one of the key means that we are going to be able to develop for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the case, Mr President, I think that the salient conclusion that should be drawn from our work – and this view is shared by a good number of fellow Members of all political complexions – is that henceforth, firstly, we shall do our utmost to monitor what is going on and, secondly, we shall insist, as a basic requirement, that the Commission should be open with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the development budget, the cooperation between Mrs Rühle and ourselves was excellent. Initially, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Development and Cooperation kept themselves to themselves, according to their own focus. Later on, we joined forces and managed, in tandem with the Commission, to put certain things in order thanks to the action plan. This conceals, of course, a particularly grave situation, which cannot simply be attributed to one single person. In actual fact, we have a budget for the development fund and, in broader terms, the development sphere, where clear goals are lacking and where staffing levels are inadequate within the critical spheres, which need to be worked on. All of this sets the scene for enormous backlogs and for a control culture dominated by self-interest and fear, rather than actual results and a duty to achieve results and take action. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are on the brink of a cultural revolution, which will bring about this change. This means that the 2001 budget will make it possible to set clear goals within education and health care. Amounts will be made available which allow for sufficient personnel and which can subsequently be verified to see whether the plan actually worked. But this requires delegation, responsibility, and – in a word – a modern efficient budget coupled with a modern insight into how budgetary policy works within development policy. </p>
<p class="contents">This is how I see the action plan; this is how I see our joint action. I see it as a joint effort with the Commission. I am thrilled about the fact that we can, as it were, close off a chapter of fear and a culture of self-interest. I know there are many motivated officials within the Commission who will now be given the opportunity to perform within the sphere which we would all like to see do well, namely to give people who live in difficult circumstances – one in five still have no access to clean drinking water or primary education – a better chance of a decent life. We in Europe want to play a key role in establishing this with the necessary resources. But this means that we need to actually make this change within the next couple of months. </p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the more general comment I wanted to make. The whole discussion here today will eventually culminate in the 1998 discharge. For the Socialist group, this will also signify, more generally, the closing off of the chapter of fear and working towards the chapter in which we as Commission and European Parliament take joint responsibility. In this respect, the Kinnock reforms, or the general internal reforms, are essential. After all, if we do not succeed in building a new system of financial control and Activity-Based Budgeting, and if we fail to reallocate sufficient personnel to those areas where we need more people, then all we do is create more paperwork, shift more bits of paper with more control and fail to come up with the goods at the end. And this is, at the end of the day, what the European citizen judges you as Commission and us as Parliament on. It would mean a great deal to me if in the course of the forthcoming budget, we could, as it were, set our good intentions on a new course for 2001. I wish the Commission every success in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am going to confine my comments to the general Commission discharge for 1998, which has taken on a highly political and divisive tone right from the start of our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we have been through several rounds of a boxing match but ultimately the whole committee, including the rapporteur, said that discharge should be granted. Rather than stick with the hysterical, drum-beating report that the rapporteur produced, which, if truth be told, had little originality, no sense of direction and no suggestion on how to move ahead constructively, the committee decided back in March to postpone the discharge and to set out seventeen clear conditions which we expected the Commission to sign up to in the space of a couple of months. We were delighted that the rapporteur saw the error of her ways and supported our way of thinking. Round one to us, the anti-PPE alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur then tried a fast left hook with her headline-grabbing explanatory statement. She lost. Round two to the anti-PPE alliance. The Commission responded constructively to most of the points we set out in March. The next Stauner report was in the same hysterical tone as the first round but this time we were ready for her. Round three to the anti-PPE alliance. We thought the fight was over, but no, we were in for more with the new explanatory statement. We have yet to see the result of that round but we are confident about the final knock-out round and we confidently predict what will happen on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">The only real question that remains is why her name is still on the report. The truth is, we know that the Commission has a long way to go in getting its act together. The Court of Auditors was right in not giving its O.K. to the Commission expenditure in 1998, but we are willing now to give the Commission the benefit of the doubt. We think that this is a genuine attempt at reform and the Commission needs a certain amount of time to implement the necessary changes. We will keep an eye on the situation and make sure the Commission sticks to the promises it has made. For example, the promise to cut the number of errors is a major promise but it will not happen unless we have the commitment and the resources to go with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, can you assure us that particularly in the areas of high risk, agriculture, structural funds and research, we will see more checks rather than fewer, as happened in 1998? Will we see significantly more resources for auditing within the DGs in cooperation with the internal audit service? Can you give us these figures, please?</p>
<p class="contents">You know, Commissioner, that one area where we were dissatisfied with your answers was in response to lessons learned from Fléchard. We know from the Court of Auditors, unlike Mrs Stauner, that we cannot get the money back. Will you make a commitment though to cooperate fully with our internal inquiry committee and give us the information we request?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that in our committee, we will be able to stop fighting each other and get on with fighting fraud.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pomés Ruiz (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, thank you very much for your generosity, and thanks also to my fellow Member for his understanding and kindness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin, not with the most important report, but by replying to the comments of Mr Kuhne which I really consider to be unfortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the political groups – as you know – do not have a genuine regulation. My political group, and practically all the others, are complying with the existing regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Your political group has its way of organising its finances, as do all the others. Fifteen offices of this Parliament are devoted to the European Socialist Party, and a crowd of officials, who are paid from public funds, are dedicated exclusively to the work of one political party.</p>
<p class="contents">Other political groups prefer to have their offices outside Parliament, and have their own officials and adopt totally legal financing formulae.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, at a time when we are asking for a statute for the parties – because Europe needs not only European parliamentary groups, but also European political parties – at a time when there is a certain harmony amongst all the groups, I consider the references in his report to peculiar things to be unfortunate – as the chairman of our group, Mr Poettering, has correctly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kuhne, you know that that is not the case. We lack regulation. My political group, like all of them, is going to comply with the regulations and provide information when it is appropriate to do so. However, when free to do so, each group has managed its finances in the way they considered appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the work of Mrs Stauner in this extremely important report, but I would like to point out, briefly, that we are not trying to weaken the new Commission, on which we have placed so many hopes, as we have on the Commissioner responsible for the budget and for financial control, Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">We are analysing a financial year of the last Commission, and we have asked the current Commission to diligently manage issues which were pending from the previous Commission. The proof that we are fundamentally satisfied with its work lies in the fact that we are going to propose the discharge, obviously with reserves, of the accounts for 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Commission is taking its time. Logically, at the beginning it needs more time, but we hope that other decisions will be taken much more quickly. We also hope that the Interinstitutional Agreement which we have finally reached will improve our relations, so that we can provide each other with mutual support and build Europe more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We also understand that you are immersed in a process of administrative reform, which in my opinion and in the opinion of other MEPs, is not ambitious enough: decisions are lacking and there are matters which it is not dealing with. It is not your direct responsibility, but you already know that we believe that a lot of funds are wasted as a result of this passive attitude, the lack of motivation amongst officials and the failure to take responsibility, because people are too concerned with controlling errors or seeking their own promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">To end, I would like to say that we agree with the discharge of the accounts which the three reports refer to.</p>

I can assure her that this will continue to be the case for the next four or five years. All I can say is that so far, she has throughout the discussions shown herself to be a worthy opponent. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to comment on Mrs Stauner’s report on the resolution, which accompanies the discharge. With regard to the resolution, what matters most to the Liberal group is that so far, the Court of Auditors has failed to arrive at a positive statement of assurance. The error rate is still too high and I feel we need to clearly stick to the points made in the resolution: the Commission must ensure that a positive statement of assurance can be issued by 2003. Definite deadlines are needed and it would be useful if the Commission could clearly state, both internally and externally, which categories of the budget we want to reach a very low error rate in, where possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is that these days, documents have suddenly gone missing not only within the European Commission, but all over Europe. We have heard that the Commission will set up an archiving system by the end of the year which will ensure that mistakes which have been made in the past – I particularly refer to the butter export to the Soviet Union – will no longer occur. </p>
<p class="contents">As for those butter exports, the Commissioner has already commented on them in her response to the earlier interventions. There is a clear difference of opinion between the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors. It was evident from both the European Court of Auditors and the most recent report by the Committee of Wise Men that the Commission did not have the authority in terms of proportionality, retro-activity and such like, which it claims to have, or claims to have at least to a certain extent. It is up to Parliament to establish this and we will certainly do this. We expect constructive cooperation from the Commission on this score. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kuhne has already mentioned the salient points in his report: a neutral staff policy on merit within Parliament, public service contracts and better management of the inventory. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Mrs Rühle’s report, we could not agree more with the comments she made about the need for better coordination between the Member States and the European Commission. It is the Member States that foot the bill for the European Development Fund. If the Member States vote for a certain policy, which the Commission proposes within the European Development Committee, it seems only logical to me that, if they are in favour of this policy, they will pursue the same policy using their own bilateral resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In April, the power of the plenary meeting became evident. Against the Committee on Budgetary Control’s judgement, we rejected the European Parliament’s discharge, and we formulated five requests for the Secretary-General of this Parliament. This illustrated that we can be just as firm with Parliament as we can with other institutions, notably the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my personal and heartfelt thanks to Secretary-General Priestley and his staff for the efficient and bold manner in which he met this request and has provided us with the information required. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the 1998 discharge was a fascinating and at the same time useful exercise. And we can now grant this discharge with a clear conscience whilst taking into consideration the comments included in the Stauner, Kuhne and Rühle resolutions. But I am left with some concern, as if something bad could happen at any time. Indeed, the framework agreement between the European Commission and Parliament which is due to be voted on tomorrow is hanging over us like a sword of Damocles. I call on all MEPs, including the MEPs who are following this debate in their chambers, to study this framework agreement carefully and to examine how Parliament’s powers in respect of the grant of discharge are being whittled away. I would invite you to read Paragraph 17, which contravenes Article 276 of the Treaty of the European Union, and would also invite you to read Annex 3, which is clipping the wings of the individual MEPs and rapporteurs. I would call on you to fight the establishment of this Parliament, the establishment within your own groups and not to consent to this framework agreement tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to show my support for Mrs Stauner, despite the fact that the Social Democrats criticise her. This may be based on the fact that during the Fléchard case, when Delors was the President of the Commission, the Head of his Private Office was the present Commissioner Lamy. Under no circumstances can we accept that certain documents, which would shed some light on the use of funds, have vanished. I would also like to support Mr Kuhne in the assessments he makes in his report, which, for its part, was criticised by members of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. In my opinion, parliamentary rapporteurs have to speak and write what they think about the use of parliamentary funds, in which case the interests of no group can put up a barrier.

We are, however, able to give discharge for the European Development Fund. It is true that what happened in 1998 is not the responsibility of this Commission, but I think there has been insufficient willingness to assign responsibility for the mistakes of the past. Where the general budget is concerned, I just want to highlight two serious issues, the Fléchard case and the problems surrounding ECHO's humanitarian aid, and also to emphasise that the whole budgeting process is characterised by a lack of precision. This is what we normally view as the existence of unused appropriations. Budgeting is not just about coming up with a few figures. It is just as much about designing one’s administrative and production machinery in such a way that the objectives laid down in the budget can be achieved. Like the ECHO case, the Fléchard case is an example of the irresponsible use of European taxpayers’ money. It has not happened during the period of the present Commission, but in both cases I have just mentioned we see an insufficient willingness on the part of the Commission to hold high-ranking civil servants accountable. The Commission knows that there are criminal activities behind these cases. The Commission knows that certain illegal forces have made anonymous threats to our colleagues, Mrs Stauner and Mr Blak, and this ought to make the Commission realise that a much more vigorous approach is required if action is to be taken against the internal forces partly responsible for the fact that European taxpayers’ money can disappear into the pockets of criminals. </p>
<p class="contents">We now seem, of course, to have two spokespersons for the Commission: the official one, Commissioner Schreyer, and the unofficial one, Mrs Morgan. The latter’s statement here aptly illustrates why this Parliament is in no position to be more effective in cleaning up the administration. In the Danish Parliament, we have a saying about the Finance Committee. We ask, ‘Do you know what a cat is?’, and the reply is, ‘A cat is a tiger which has been to a consultation with the Finance Committee.’ That is not the case here. Mrs Schreyer can always come here sure in the knowledge that Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control will not hurt a hair of her head. Where Parliament’s 1998 accounts are concerned, I would note that the problem is the same as in other areas of the Union, namely an all too careless attitude to the way in which the money is used. On the subject of the Spinelli building, I would point out that it was acquired at too great an expense and in an unusual way, not easily seen through. I should like to add that this is not a criticism I am directing at the Secretary-General, for I do not believe there is any basis for such criticism. Rather, it is a criticism to be directed against the system itself, for this is not good enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have taken the discharge procedure most seriously and I should also like to thank the administration and the Secretary-General for their collaboration in this exercise. I think it was a good approach to clarify matters, look into them more carefully and solve some outstanding problems with a properly argued report enabling Parliament to have all the facts in order to grant discharge to the administration and the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is whom discharge is addressed to, even though it concerns the administration. I am pleased to see that discharge has been granted to Parliament. I think we have done an excellent job. Group finances are also going to be more transparent and more appropriate to the exercise we are making ready for if we wish to continue along the road of financing political parties. It was a useful exercise, properly carried out, and Mr Kuhne should be congratulated. I think we should be able to vote broadly in favour of his report the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say the same for Mrs Stauner’s report. I feel it is misguided to attempt to use the rapporteur’s role to one’s own ends: it is deceiving Parliament and deceiving oneself. This practice has been appalling. Right up to the very end, we shall have been witness to abuse of the procedure. More than 60% of the report voted upon consisted of amendments. Mr President, it is extremely rare for a report to be quite so turned around after the vote in committee. This clearly demonstrates that the rapporteur must interpret the committee’s opinion logically. If the rapporteur does not interpret the opinions expressed by the committee accurately then the report will be beset by amendments. The rapporteur is supposed to be the spokesperson for the parliamentary committee. I feel that a situation where 60% of the amendments are adopted is verging on the nonsensical, and indicates some deep-seated malaise. The practice of playing games with the explanatory statement must stop. It is not acceptable to attempt, as Mrs Stauner did, to include points in the explanatory statement which had not been accepted by the majority in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of some importance. This Parliament has no clear majority or minority. We have to rely to a certain extent on parliamentary fair play. If a clear majority emerges, then this majority feeling should be expressed in all the aspects of a report, without resorting to playing on words or abusing procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some of the pictures shown on television from Germany, involving extremely prominent people, suggest to me that one must look to one’s own backyard before preaching to Parliament and to Europe. We must ensure that private and public matters are not muddled. We shall therefore grant the discharge. We shall support this report which the rapporteur is clearly against. Rest assured, Mr President, that the TDI group will vote in favour of discharge, at least the radical wing of the group which I represent here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ombudsman is not entitled to receive full information; the Court of Auditors has complained that it is unable to obtain full information; in Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, it is a permanent topic on the agenda; and our President, Mrs Theato, has severely criticised the new draft agreement between Parliament and the Commission, for the draft agreement will not give us the documents we are requesting, either. Let us reject it tomorrow. My personal experience of the Commission is of encountering a good deal of beating about the bush whenever I ask for information which ought to be available. Those who vote in favour of the draft agreement do not know how many committees and committee meetings they are approving. Nor do they know if there are any problems regarding the competence of any of the participants. Indeed, as a rule we do not know everyone involved in day-to-day legislation and in the administration of the now 800 billion being used. Nor do we know how much is being paid out to, for example, Danisco. As long as the Commission is not making the information available that the Court of Auditors and elected representatives are requesting, my group can be relied upon to vote against approving the accounts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately though, the opposite still holds true, as borne out by cases such as Fléchard and the ECHO administration. The Commission is still denying Parliament access to information on these misdemeanours to this day, which on no account should we take lying down. Nor should we be surprised if European citizens continue to lose confidence in these administrative systems. Consequently, we Independents have no intention whatsoever of granting discharge to the report on the general budget. This ought to send out a clear signal that we are committed to creating efficient and economical administrative systems in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate Mrs Stauner on the courage which she has shown in getting her report – although not much of it is in its original form – through this Parliament. We need, in this debate, to associate the 1998 discharge with that of the framework agreement which we will be voting on tomorrow. Hopefully we will see signs of a more democratic Europe as a result of these last few months.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Parliament's role in the discharge has been shown to be one of extreme importance. The Council, by its absence today, shows its lack of interest in the way in which we, as a Parliament, have used our powers to begin the birth of a political Europe. Without the 1996 discharge there would have been no Wise Men's report, no Commission resignation and no real urgency for Commission reform.</p>
<p class="contents">But not all of us in this House have been heroes. We have found ourselves split between countries, within countries, within delegations, often with strongly held views. It was the Socialist leader, Mrs Green, who took the biscuit by voting for a motion of confidence on a motion of censure, which she did indeed get. Miss Morgan now continues this particular inheritance by asking for a depolitisation of the discharge process. Indeed, one or two of her amendments, like removing paragraphs 47 and 48 of the discharge report today show that some of these amendments look more Commission-born than in Parliament's interests.</p>
<p class="contents">But where to now? Monitoring is necessary to make sure that what we have gained as a Parliament is maintained. Mr Prodi needs to be supported in his reforms of the Commission. Last but not least, our most important role is to make sure we have greater accountability and more democracy and that it is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning for Parliament's rights in the European institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Poettering, this draft report by Mr Kuhne was adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control by a large majority. It is in the nature of budgetary control that there always has to be somebody who feels their toes have been trodden on. In this case, Mr Poettering, you are the one. Alternatively, it might be French MEPs, or sometimes it might be colleagues from another area. Mr Poettering, people are labouring under a misapprehension as far as budgetary control is concerned, not just in the Commission but also in this House. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling from Mr Poettering)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Please do not interrupt me, Mr Poettering, it cannot be translated. You are not speaking into the microphone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one of the problems we are facing, and I would add that Mr Dell'Alba’s attack on Mrs Stauner should be repudiated in just the same way. Some serious work has been done here and it is only natural that it should contain personal touches and reflect the writer’s own cultural background to some extent, but I repudiate determinedly, and with a sense of consternation, the fact that the integrity of rapporteurs is under attack here. It is hardly surprising that two Members of the Conference of Presidents should have a problem with the control and authority exercised by the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to endorse Mr Staes’ comment that the stipulations contained in this framework agreement on the transfer of documents are an affront, and no Parliamentarian worth his salt can do other than regard them as such and repudiate them accordingly.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I have a problem with your closing comments, Mrs Schreyer, in which you again presented the new Commission’s entire reform project, and would remind you of what President Prodi said in this House about Parliament’s access to documents, namely transparency and open access. What we have today are secret negotiations and countless dossiers, and I ask myself how, at the end of the day, we are supposed to come into our own as representatives of the European tax-payers?</p>

I would not wish to sink to the level that some of those present have opted for.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament postponed the discharge for the 1998 financial year in April, but with no intention whatsoever of provoking a trial of strength with the Commission or even working towards a refusal of discharge. There was a need for further clarification, which would take time and effort, and it was always my aim, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to complete the discharge process by the summer recess.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As these reports show, the past few weeks have been used to answer questions – albeit not all of them – and consequently, although our recommendation in respect of the outstanding discharges may not be unanimous, it is a positive one. I welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission is willing to work towards a reduction of errors in budgetary management, with a view to receiving a better statement of assurance as soon as possible. I detect a certain candour where the so-called old cases of suspected fraud are concerned. We have never held the new Commission responsible for these cases as such, but would still like to know that the right lessons have been drawn from the past through reappraisal, so that these cases do not come back to haunt us one day.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is something I would like to ask you in this connection, Mrs Schreyer. When are the legislative proposals for a comprehensive legal and judicial area for the protection of the Union’s financial interests to be submitted? We agreed, on the basis of my report in January, that they were to be submitted by 30 June. It is 4 July today.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If there is one thing all those involved should be clear about where the impending grant of discharge is concerned, then it is this: We are not talking about a certificate of non-objection here. In future, the institution must be more willing to cooperate and provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with the information it needs to do its work, promptly and without evasion. If we build up confidence, reduce the amount of bureaucracy and exercise democracy openly – and this applies to so many areas – then I believe we will get back to being able to grant discharge on time each April. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our granting discharge for 1998 is, in reality, a vote of confidence. We are giving the Commission a chance to prove that it is different from the old Commission. I would also take the opportunity to call for a cessation of hostilities here in Parliament. Let us unite all the forces that are in favour of the Commission’s developing into a modern, open and effective institution. The European project can only succeed if we show zero tolerance for fraud, nepotism and corruption. Otherwise, we shall never get the people on our side. Let us cut across party lines and national allegiances. Constructive criticism of the Commission must not go unheard due to Parliament’s internal bickering. There are more and more people who think that we should simply forget the past and concentrate on changing the general way in which things are done, but I disagree with that view. We need to clean up the legacy of the past, or matters will never improve. I do not think we have received enough in the way of admissions from the Commission when it comes to the events of the past. This applies both to the Fléchard and ECHO cases, and I can assure the Commission that these matters have not been buried away, just because we are now giving discharge for 1998. We shall not forget them until they have been resolved in a proper and dignified manner. I am, on the other hand, very satisfied with the new initiatives the Commission has taken to clean up the area of development aid, but these have also been overdue. Both Mr Patten and Mr Nielson have been very critical of the way in which development aid has been administered. Mr Patten has said it is embarrassing for the EU and the Commission and called it the worst way of providing development aid. For Mr Nielson, it was enough to call it a ‘a pizza service without delivery’. I am also very pleased that Mr Nielson has instituted an investigation into the extent to which the delegations are fulfilling their responsibilities in the high-risk countries. He has also promised that disciplinary action will be taken if they are not in fact fulfilling these, and I am very pleased about that development, but do not imagine that we shall forget you. Finally, I wish to say that I think it was a shameless attack which Mr Dell'Alba made on Mrs Stauner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has been criticised, particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, yet she has produced an outstanding piece of work, and I wished to make that point today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a few words regarding the speeches made by the Socialist Members. In all sincerity, without adding to the controversy, I feel that we have nothing to learn from the European Socialists regarding the use of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words on the Rühle report. We were all extremely shocked both by the massive misappropriation of European Development Fund resources and also by the Commission’s attitude, which was to carefully conceal its dealings from the Court of Auditors, the former UCLAF (unit for the coordination of fraud prevention) and the European Parliament. In spite of this particularly scandalous state of affairs, we have nonetheless adopted a positive attitude and have attempted, along with the new Commission, to provide valid and practical solutions to the underlying problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the agreements between the European Union and a good number of third world countries is to enable the latter to have balanced and sustainable development but, in order to do so, the funds allocated would actually have to get to the end-users and, as we have known for a long time, corruption and fraud are depriving entire regions of the greater part of these sums. To take just one example, the medical aid granted the Ivory Coast, particularly to combat AIDS, we are talking about some 38% of the aid being misappropriated, or almost EUR 30 million!</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Rühle’s report represents, then, the very last warning issued to the administration of the European Development Fund, who have until October to implement radical reforms in order to fulfil the expectations of Parliament, all the citizens of the European Union and, most especially, the populations of the countries concerned, who still have a vital need for European aid. So, until October, when we shall meet again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maybe this is due to the fact that the PPE-DE group is not one group, that the British Conservatives are allowed to run their own shop and that they keep their own accounts. It is they who must improve their books.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stauner had to be stopped for speaking too fast at the beginning of this debate. It is a telling metaphor for the work she did in committee. She ran ahead of the committee without the rest of us realising what was going on. She tried and condemned the Commission for not sharing the outlandish views she has of financial management and control. Even the Court of Auditors does not agree with her. The job of the Committee on Budgetary Control is not to hang the Commission out to dry for the duration of a parliament, but to ensure that Europe's citizens are served by an executive that implements its political priorities efficiently and effectively. Fortunately that view was shared by the majority of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the disastrous consequences of this whole standoff has been the proposal that is before us tomorrow for a framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission. This agreement will restrict the rights of individual MEPs, of rapporteurs, to ask for information from the Commission. It is a short-sighted proposal and if we do not postpone the debate until September then we should vote against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should just like to say, as we are about to listen to Mr Chirac and what he has to say about the French presidency, that I hope that he will also listen to what this Parliament has to say, and in particular to Parliament's view that it should be able to decide for itself where it meets, when it wants to meet, and that this should not be imposed by the governments of the Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has taken a long time for responsibility to be accepted and also acted on. The instructions and legislation in force today bear this out. I also want, and feel compelled, to express my admiration of our rapporteur, Gabriele Stauner. With her sharp legal mind, and the courage of her convictions, she concentrated on the facts of the matter, helped to shed light on errors and gave us all – and by that I mean all the EU institutions involved – time to reflect, at last opening the eyes of those who had persisted in their blindness.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Personnel were reorganised and many initially invisible doors were opened. I too had many discussions on behalf of the research sphere. The storm gradually died down. At first, we approached each other cautiously, but watchfully, then we began to work constructively together. In fact the media and the public should be made aware of this, because at the end of the day, we are all in the same boat. I would therefore like to thank all our opposite numbers, be they from the Commission, the Court of Auditors or the European Parliament. That said, I was disappointed at first, because some of my proposed amendments were defeated 10 to 10. But it was still a good outcome. Everyone should know by now what is going to matter most in the future. It is all about the credibility of the EU, and in my research area it is about the pure necessity of regarding research as a great asset which lends enormous European added value, and about dealing with it in a suitably careful manner in future, so that we are in a position to grant discharge to the Commission with a truly cheerful heart for once.

I should like to address you in the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stauner’s initial report on discharge for the year 1998 gave rise to a great many questions and criticisms, which were expressed, in particular, in the vote in favour of an amendment noting the discrepancies between the compromise resolution and the explanatory statement. In drawing up her second report, the rapporteur apparently did not take account of her fellow members’ general lack of satisfaction. Once again, we must deplore Mrs Stauner’s method. She kept on asking the Commission for more and more information, going beyond the recommendations made in the resolution adopted on 13 April. Today she is still asking questions which have already been explicitly answered. This attitude has led the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to make radical changes to the draft report. This is the reason why the text on which we are to vote during this part-session is substantially different from the initial draft.</p>
<p class="contents">This text does now afford us a more comprehensive overview of the Commission’s implementation of the 1998 budget, but at the price of a political conflict dominated by a feeling of frustration. We can only deplore the far from constructive attitude of the rapporteur both within the parliamentary committee and with regard to the European Commission. We cannot fail to note the same petty political excesses that some of us already condemned in the initial report on discharge for the year 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective must be to work in close collaboration with the Commission in the interest of our fellow citizens and of the implementation of our policies, and to make the discharge report a proper assessment of the implementation of the European Union budget in both quantitative and qualitative terms.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to say, just to correct something that Mrs Morgan said earlier, that I am very lucky in this debate, because my party declared in our manifesto – which helped so many of us on this side get elected – that we would not give discharge to any EU accounts until the Commission reform process had been successfully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot therefore follow the lead of our excellent rapporteur, who recommends granting discharge to the Commission, for the reasons I have already given and because many people outside this place have been wondering what actually improved between 1996 and 1998. Most people believe that things got worse within the Commission in that time rather than better. I only joined the Committee on Budgetary Control a couple of months ago, and to me the meetings and the reports of the last two months have raised probably more questions than they have answered.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to ask two of those questions. Firstly, can the Commission confirm whether Mr Fléchard is related in any way to Mr Delors and/or members of his cabinet? Secondly, can he confirm whether any of his or Commissioner Kinnock's cabinet have actively lobbied MEPs for support of the Socialist Group, and in particular for Mrs Morgan's amendments on the Stauner report?

Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998. I have carefully read the Court of Auditors' report on the accounts for that year, particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds. I have come to the conclusion, having had a lot of experience in Parliament and with European affairs, that things have been steadily improving and that 1998 was one of the best performances we had.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties which occurred – a 4% possible error in the area of agriculture and a little more in the area of Structural Funds – did not result from the failure of the European Commission to dispense those funds in an efficient way, but from a failure – and it was a small failure – to control the Member States and the European governments and to ensure that the Member States and their administrations had done the job in the way it should have been done.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my first point. The second point is in relation to Fléchard. I do not think it is reasonable to inform the people of Europe that there was a loss of EUR 14 million to the European budget arising out of this case. To say this is to use a sort of accountancy jargon that puts the whole issue beyond the understanding of the ordinary European citizen. The truth is that in the Fléchard case, Fléchard was suspected of fraud, the Irish government fined and punished them to the extent of EUR 17 million. Fléchard took the Irish government to court and won an injunction preventing the Irish government from taking the EUR 17 million. The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing you can say about that settlement is that it was made on a legal basis which was not in effect when the crime was committed, but was in effect while the case was still open. It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not, as in the past, interfere in their responsibilities, and that when the Commission takes national governments to task, it can rely on our support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament. I urge you to take suitable steps towards ensuring that Mr Dell'Alba avails himself of democratic manners like everyone else, even if – as I readily grant him – he obviously finds it difficult!</p>
