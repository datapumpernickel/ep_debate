In particular I should like to thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report and also for the good cooperation we have enjoyed over the past year on the dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been grateful for the support and ideas of the Committee on Regional Development and Parliament during this period on what is perhaps the most important and innovative part of the new cohesion policy for 2007-2013. Through the guidelines we are seeking to ensure that Community priorities are more fully integrated into national and regional development programmes supported by the Union. The guidelines seek to provide a clear and consistent approach in support of growth and jobs under the renewed Lisbon Strategy. I believe that the guidelines have benefited considerably from Parliament’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention to the recitals that have been added to the document since Parliament produced its report last May. These are important in the sense that they reveal the political orientation that lies behind the guidelines. The recitals draw heavily on the suggestions in the report drafted by Mrs Krehl. For example, they draw attention to the importance of partnership (recital 16), to the contribution of infrastructure to convergence (recital 11), to equality of opportunity and the fight against discrimination (recital 15), to the importance of development that is sustainable in environmental terms (recital 14), to territorial cohesion and to the urban dimension (recital 12).</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that in adopting these recitals the Council and the Member States are in effect writing a memo to themselves on how the next programmes should be run. This is clearly very important for us as we look forward to the programme negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the recitals, the text of the guidelines has been reinforced in key areas of importance to Parliament. In particular we have given more attention to territorial cohesion. This includes stronger wording on the urban question. We have also developed the text on the three initiatives – Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica – which you have supported strongly. This should, among other things, make a contribution to developing the use of public/private partnerships in our programmes, which is one of the recommendations of your report on the guidelines. There are many other areas where I think you will find that the Commission has tried to accommodate Parliament’s wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to summarise once again the content of the document, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to remind ourselves of the vision of the new cohesion policy, which the strategic guidelines can help us to achieve. This vision is centred around economic development, which is increasingly being driven by local and regional resources, be it innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, local human skills or academic institutions. This vision is about developing our unique system of multilevel governance by taking policy closer to the local and regional levels, closer to the people and closer to the place where growth and jobs are created.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of you expressed a wish to have more debate on strategic guidelines, so I am looking forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Constanze Angela Krehl (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote, Parliament is laying the keystone of two-and-a-half years’ work on preparing the legislative package on cohesion policy for the years 2007–2013. This is a cohesion policy that is to function with 25 – or 27 – Member States for the first time, the new Member States all being beneficiaries of the Cohesion Fund and set to draw great benefit from the future cohesion and structural policies. We should like tomorrow’s vote to clear the way for the conclusion, submission and approval by the Commission of the operational programmes in the regions, so as to ensure an early start to the projects in the less-favoured regions of the EU next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back, I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the cooperation I have received on the report on the strategic guidelines. The Commission proposal is good; it was a joint effort – with the Commission and the Council, that is – and I should like to mention explicitly here that we had a great deal of direct contact with the regions. The visits I was able to make to Lisbon, Madrid, Bratislava, Prague, Stockholm and Helsinki as rapporteur contributed considerably to the quality of the report that was subsequently adopted jointly in committee and plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the additional priorities Parliament wanted to introduce for the guidelines have indeed been largely reflected in the document on which the Council decided in August.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably the most important point is the clear statement that we want the EU to develop in a sustainable way, that we have more in view than short-term economic objectives, but instead are striving for sustainable improvements, including in living and working conditions, particularly in the less-favoured and underdeveloped regions of the EU. That is why it was so important to us that access to cohesion funding be free from discrimination. The final document now present spells out once more that disabled and elderly people and those with a migrant background have exactly the same access to funding as everyone else. This is an important signal to the public in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have attached importance to emphasising that the EU is striving to create not just any jobs, but better-quality, sustainable jobs. This is closely linked to an improvement in training and in the opportunities for setting up research organisations, and also to the opportunity of bringing the results produced by these research organisations to small and medium-sized enterprises more quickly and to a greater extent. We have anchored all of this even more strongly in the strategic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Very important to us – after a long, detailed debate – is the field of support for towns, cities and urban areas, as it is there that 80% of the European population lives. For this reason, we must concentrate resources on this field, not only on job creation, but also, for example, on the development of transport infrastructure or the improvement of the environmental situation in towns and cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have emphasised one point in particular, and that is the territorial cooperation that is more important than ever in an enlarged EU to enable us to learn from one another and develop projects together. Last week, a working-group visit to Hungary gave me the first opportunity to see for myself the kind of strategically intelligent visions and ideas that are being generated in the new Member States, too. Perhaps some of the regions that have been receiving EU cohesion funding for years could take a leaf out of the new Member States’ book. For this we need to promote territorial cooperation further, however.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point – about which I shall speak particularly in my role as coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – concerns the promotion of equal opportunities in the EU, particularly for women and young people. In the new aid period, the Community should further draw on the success it has achieved with EQUAL and continue to operate the networks. This has also been incorporated into the guidelines. On the whole, we, Parliament, can count the negotiation results as a great success, not only for Parliament, but also for the public.</p>
<p class="contents">No success or compromise can survive without a ‘but’. There is of course a ‘but’ with these guidelines, too. Parliament has attached great importance to enhancing cooperation with the social partners and civil society, and this has made its way into the guidelines, in the report finally adopted by the Council, but unfortunately only in significantly watered-down form. We, Parliament, shall be at pains to speak up again on the occasion of the mid-term review of the structural support period and revise these guidelines together. This will relate to the cooperation, and we shall also examine very carefully whether earmarking was really a good idea on the part of the Council, or whether it only serves to increase bureaucracy for those involved. If this is the case, we shall certainly press for its abolition, as Parliament has a responsibility and duty towards the public, a duty it intends to fulfil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament's report deals with the Community's strategic guidelines and is an excellent example of interinstitutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, through the work of its Committee on Regional Development, has tried to define its expectations during the course of the legislative process and today we can say that nearly all of these expectations have been taken into account. It is true that there is a discrepancy between the strategic guidelines as they are presented today and the previously published list detailing Lisbon Strategy spending, which was later included as an annex to the regulation. Nonetheless, the Members of this House believe that we should support the final version of the strategic guidelines, as they meet our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be said that, for the Member States, the strategic guidelines form an internally coherent basis for planning the implementation of cohesion policy. Having first adopted these guidelines by means of a Council directive, let us hope that the individual Member States will be prepared to implement them. An indicator of the resolve of the national governments will be, for example, the use they make of the guideline on strengthening the role of towns during the planning stage and when implementing integrated regeneration programmes. The strategic guidelines are indispensable for the creation of a framework for implementing cohesion policy between 2007 and 2013. That is why I think the House should support this proposal which takes account of the European Parliament's suggestions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could refer, in connection with the initial text, to the improved guidelines on the principle of sustainable development in Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund interventions, of equal treatment for men and women and of non-discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion or disability, with emphasis on the accessibility of people with disabilities to all stages of the preparation and implementation of programmes and works, of the emphasis on the urban dimension and of the linking of urban and rural areas and partnership in general.</p>
<p class="contents">One essential success factor for the programmes as far as we are concerned is the extent to which all the interested agencies – at regional and local level – will be included in their planning and implementation, especially the social partners and the local authorities. Achieving the objective of economic and social cohesion during the new programming period does indeed constitute a difficult challenge, at a time when inequalities in enlarged Europe are increasing and funds for applying cohesion policy are restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic guidelines are an important means in the direction of more efficient and targeted distribution of funds. At the same time, they strengthen the strategic content of the cohesion policy and create the framework for synergy between it and the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the start of a new era for the cohesion policy. In the new programming period and in light of the interim review, the cohesion policy will be called upon to prove – if I may say so – its raison d'être and the need for it to continue. All of the foregoing, together with other quality factors introduced by Parliament in either the regulations or the guidelines, will be what helps to achieve its objectives. The Member States and the regions must take them into account when preparing their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes. Proper application and supervision as regards their application are a matter for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean Marie Beaupuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I will join my fellow Members in thanking Mrs Krehl for the work she has done and in thanking you, Mrs Hübner, for the quality of the relations we have had with you and with all of your services throughout the months that have led us to tomorrow’s vote. No one will be surprised as to how my group votes because, of course, we shall adopt this text, and we shall do so for at least two reasons. Firstly, it takes account not only of the majority of the requests from our group, but also, I believe, of the requests from the majority of us. Secondly, this matter has gone on for far longer than was scheduled, and it is therefore important that we adopt this text.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make four comments. Firstly, I should like to point out to you – as my fellow Members have already done on several occasions – that, in Article 1 of the text that was adopted on 18 August by the Council, the words ‘to act as an indicative framework for the Member States’ are written in black and white, Commissioner. I am aware that, as things currently stand, it is considered bad form to want to impose on the 25 Heads of State or Government directives that come from the Commission or Parliament. I should, however, like to stress that we would have liked to have found some slightly more binding elements in this text. As some of my fellow Members, such as Mrs Krehl, have said, we will make sure, at mid-term, that we formulate the points of view that will be needed to change the wayward paths that may have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: I must emphasise the motivation for these strategic guidelines. The contacts that I currently have refer me to a Brussels ‘technostructure’ and to a Parliament that decides on strategic guidelines. All of that is very complicated. People forget too quickly, far too quickly, that it is in fact thanks to these Structural Funds and to these guidelines that, in previous years – with Portugal, Spain and Ireland – we have achieved important results, and this for the benefit of human beings who experience unfavourable circumstances in disadvantaged regions. They forget that our commitment to solidarity, which is being expressed today in this cohesion policy, is designed to allow all the communities and each and every inhabitant of the disadvantaged regions to have access to the same benefits as people in the more well-off regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to say how much I welcome the flexible approach announced at the very start of this text. It is an approach that, in taking account of the strengths and weaknesses of each region, should enable priority to be given to transport, to the environment and to energy, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like our fellow Members from the intergroup, who have already highlighted this point, we welcome the fact that this text emphasises the importance of cities. Having been in Germany myself a few days ago, I am in a position to say – and my German fellow Members will correct me if I am wrong – that 90% of the German population live in towns or cities with more than 2 000 inhabitants. In the text submitted to us, the importance of cities is emphasised. What I should like to say is that, aside from the words, aside from the financial amounts that are going to be dedicated to the Cohesion Fund, there will be the means to use the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in your communication on cohesion policy and the cities, you have reserved a special place for the integrated approach. I should like to say, at this stage in the debate, that we must remain extremely vigilant and ensure, above all, that the implementation of the integrated approaches does not only affect the cities in the strictest sense of the word, but also the communities surrounding the cities. We were talking about this matter with my fellow Member, Mrs Bourzai, who is present in this House, at lunch. It is not just the city that counts, it is all of the land that surrounds it, within a radius of 10, 20, 50 or 100 km, in which people live together on a daily basis. If people are to live together harmoniously, the various topics concerning transport, society and education must be linked together effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that the actors must also have good links with each other: actors at national, regional, local and other levels. Just as an orchestra, with its violins and its pianos, needs a conductor in order to play well, we will ensure that there is a good conductor for all of these arrangements, one who is capable of making a success of this Cohesion Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming so frequently to Parliament to discuss her proposals with us. I would like in particular to thank Mrs Krehl for her work to bring some improvements to the Commission’s original proposal, particularly in regard to partnership, the role of cities and their hinterlands, civil society, access for the disabled and the environment. I must, however, reiterate concerns that I have raised repeatedly about earmarking, which remains central to the Commission’s guidelines. It has been and will continue to be used at Member State level to downgrade much of what Parliament has sought to do and what people have spoken about here this evening. It champions Lisbon over Gothenburg and some elements of Lisbon over others.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland, at present, there is another concern, unrelated to the guidelines, which I take this opportunity to raise. Namely, that in the future ‘Peace Programme’ funding will be distributed in a way contrary to equality measures and equality provisions. I hope to speak to the Commissioner further about this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker continued in Irish)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need to remember the original reasons for these funds and programmes and to look at them again in the mid-term review. As Mr Beaupuy reminded us, we in Ireland, north and south, experienced great benefits and great strides with the help of those funds. We have to remember our solidarity and allow other areas to do the same in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, in the European Parliament, we have discussed Romania and Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union. In relation to that enlargement, I would like to highlight a statement contained in the introduction to the Council’s decision. It reads as follows: ‘The enlargement of the European Union to include 25 Member States is an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen both the economic competitiveness and the internal cohesion of the European Union.’</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we should also be fully aware that at the moment, significant divergences remain in relation to wealth and the rate of development in certain regions. However, barely 28 months after the accession to the European Union of 10 new Member States, we can already see that even the poorest regions are developing at a significantly faster rate and now have relatively high growth rates. I speak as a citizen of one of these areas, the Podkarpacie region in south-eastern Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The word cohesion does not mean homogeneity or uniformity, but rather it describes a state where a given structure remains an intrinsic whole without internal tensions or fissures. This is my understanding of the European Union’s cohesion policy. Activities undertaken in the framework of efforts to foster solidarity between countries and nations within our Community will attain faster and greater success if there is a greater level of macroeconomic stability and essential structural changes are implemented in a more effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to define the principles for cohesion for the entire European Union and correlate them with the strategic frames of reference created by individual countries. Accordingly, we should welcome the fact that between 2007 and 2013, cohesion policy will aim to provide financial support for the least developed areas while also focusing on fostering economic growth and increasing employment. I am pleased to see that the territorial dimension of cohesion policy has been emphasised, as it aims to create a balance between the development of urban and rural areas, as well as of regions with specific characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be extremely important to make sensible use of financial instruments, which is why the mid-term assessment will play such a significant role. We should take a long-term view of our activities in Europe. I therefore think that we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy. We need to encourage innovation in all possible fields, we need to base our economy on knowledge and education and we need to foster entrepreneurship, irrespective of the size of the companies in question. These are the approaches that will guarantee success. However, we must remember that all our actions should treat people as individuals, as family members, as members of local and regional communities, as nationals of specific countries and as citizens of the whole Community. This also applies to disabled people. It is therefore very important to take account of the demographic dimension of cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the question that arises is: is the legislation which we have voted through the best? I say not. In my view, it could have been much better. However, given the equilibriums which exist in this Union, of which our countries are Member States, this European Union of twenty-five states, I can say that it is the best possible legislation. Consequently, we now have before us the challenge of seeing not only and merely how the 308 billion cohesion budget will be taken up by the Member States and the regions, but also how they will make use of all this money. Within this framework, the strategic guidelines which we are discussing today are important, because they refer precisely to the content of cohesion policy: where the money will be directed and which the priority sectors will be. Of course, it is absolutely right for cohesion policy to be linked to the Lisbon Strategy and this is clearly expressed through the guidelines. It would perhaps be better if the link had been clearer or more specific or if the Lisbon Strategy had been given a narrower definition, in order to cover certain truly leading sectors for the economy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the time of responsibility has come. The time of responsibility for the Commission, the time of responsibility for the Member States, especially for the ten new Member States which need to learn fast lessons in order to see how the Community Support Framework operates, and for us as far as control is concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">It must be stressed, in fact, that the procedure has been slightly surprising. While, at Community level, we had not yet adopted the strategic guidelines, the Member States were already in the process of preparing to adapt nationally. Admittedly, the Member States were motivated by a legitimate desire to use the new Structural Funds from 2007, but this at the risk of a lack of overall consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the expansion and the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, something that clearly reoriented the objectives. The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy, competitiveness and entrepreneurism is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of the appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of the European Parliament. I also regret the fact that the territorial dimension of cohesion should not have been explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline, even though I have fully noted the developments in relation to urban policy.

<p class="contents">I should like to focus in particular on a factor that is decisive for the effectiveness of the cohesion policy: the quality of the partnership among all the local and regional actors involved in preparing and running the programmes. Strategies drawn up at the closest possible level to the citizens really must form an integral part of the efforts to promote growth and employment. The role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need to fill local skills shortages, the importance of groupings and the need for local innovation centres are so significant that a bottom-up approach is crucial in most cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Involvement concerns not only the economic agenda, but also the more direct involvement of citizens through partnerships and the mechanisms of governance at various levels, in the context of which the cohesion policy is managed, in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of growth and employment. Closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member States’ authorities is crucial for drawing up a cohesion strategy that addresses Community priorities in a national and regional context and also for it to have a useful effect on the ground through an operational programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to congratulate Mrs Krehl, who, with her usual competence, very skilfully stimulated debate on such an important topic as the subject of this recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note, Commissioner, that the strategic guidelines give due credit to the hard work done by Parliament over the last two years. It is a result that we consider to be highly significant and important. Indeed, they take into consideration important topics on which my fellow Members have focused and which have been examined in the relevant parliamentary committee and debated here in this Chamber.</p>

After all, it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning. Consequently, these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs, with the emphasis on knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship and employment. In other words, the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy, but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself, but rather – within the framework of cohesion policy – always with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan-European competitiveness. In so doing, these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy, which, unfortunately, is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines. I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent, efficient, targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal, but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level. Unfortunately, public–private partnerships are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds, particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues. We must now do our utmost, as quickly as possible, to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon, and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will allow us to enable the European regions to benefit as much as possible from the budgetary contribution allocated for that purpose, and we have proposed the bases for the national strategic frameworks, that is to say the search for a balance between growth and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that Europe is made up of a large number of regions which have great similarities but which also have many special characteristics of their own, and we must take these into account from the point of view of cohesion: the urban environment and the rural environment, where agriculture is the main activity, the outermost regions, islands and regions suffering depopulation. In short, the cohesion policy must be aimed at eliminating the specific difficulties faced by each of them, thereby guaranteeing equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the strategic guidelines, therefore, recommendations have been introduced which must be stressed: the creation of more and better jobs; innovation and the knowledge-based economy, which contribute to the elimination of the digital divide; environmental investments, which guarantee sustainability and the management of natural resources; transport infrastructures and accessibility, which allow equal opportunities to be offered to the people most in need of them, such as the elderly, the disabled and women. The incorporation of these elements has been crucial to the proper implementation of the cohesion policy, and they will ensure that the objectives initially set are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must point out that the principle of participation in the drawing up of European policy has been taken into account. We will have thereby created the bases for mobilising the economic growth potential of all of the regions, with a cohesion policy that improves the geographical balance of economic development, increases the growth of the Union as a whole and ultimately lays the foundations for a stronger, more cohesive and more cooperative Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, however, as everyone knows, quite late in the day to be talking about this, here and now. The drafting of the operational programmes is already well under way in most countries. Obviously, it is the result that interests us. What will the Union’s regional policy, which represents almost 40% of the Community budget, really be of use to: the Lisbon Strategy, territorial cohesion, or indeed both? We hope that it will be of use to both.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, at any rate, that the principle on which Parliament was not consulted – earmarking, which mainly concerns the old Member States – is one of the most technocratic and, in my modest opinion, undoubtedly one of the least intelligent ever thought up in Europe. It is the combination of two technocracies, that of the Commission, whose skill in this area is renowned, and that of the Member States, which is as varied as it is developed. What will come of this? We can still hope for the best. To do so, we shall have to wait for the Commission to examine the operational programmes submitted by the Member States, a process that will take months.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these programmes will respond first and foremost to the needs and to the will of the urban populations, and of the rural populations, to which they apply. We know that you are paying attention, Commissioner, to these well-founded concerns. Let us hope that you can convince your interlocutors and colleagues of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document outlines the main priorities for countries applying for cohesion fund aid between 2007 and 2013. The guidelines provide the basis each Member State needs in order to draw up a strategic frame of reference defining national development priorities. These guidelines will direct future cohesion policy measures towards improving competitiveness so as to foster economic and employment growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this objective, the European Union must primarily focus on knowledge, innovation and investment in human capital, as well as on work aimed at eradicating disparities between levels of development in particular regions. Making effective use of available funds is a key task and involves measures such as fostering public-private partnership programmes, especially at a local level. It is also extremely important to pay particular attention to the urban dimension, as it is in towns and conglomerations that problems such as crime, social exclusion, pollution or heavy traffic generally make themselves felt.</p>
<p class="contents">This House should be satisfied with the current version of the strategic guidelines. We can now only hope that the Member States will be able to effectively implement cohesion policy on the basis of these guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, on a very thoroughly prepared document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour of earmarking; we should be able to admit to this in this Chamber, and I am the first to do so. This also means, though, that we can eliminate the noncommittal dimension and fragmentation to the left and right in policy. In doing so, we can update the cohesion policy to include it in a new agenda: that of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis is shifting from less concrete and less asphalt to training our people in knowledge society. We will, in the next 20 years, need to focus on cut-throat competition at world level. Central will then be the role of Parliament in this new era, with an interim review in 2009-2010. What we can then look forward to is agriculture being weighed up against cohesion policy and against Europe’s external role in the world. The focus will then be even more on the policy’s added value. It is because of that role that in the committee, I pledged my support to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that looks to enhance Parliament’s role during reassessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also asking the Commissioner and the European Commission whether we will have sufficient information at our disposal in order to be able to hold a proper debate on the financial reprioritisation. I am asking you for information about what the nation states are now doing. I sense a reluctance among our Member States to report adequately, and I regard that as a real disgrace. They are given the instruments and should respond accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the new synthesis for the new era and the new financial proportions will require a significantly reassessed policy, as well as a permanent role for the regions and the towns in the cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategic guidelines make it clear that Europe needs to concentrate on meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, which are of course close to my heart, in terms of both fostering employment and growth, and encouraging innovation and a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In our quest to meet the challenges facing the EU on the world stage and in light of our new size and scale, we must always ensure that all parties are involved, be they social partners, NGOs, local authorities or regional authorities. We have become a giant with ambitions to match our size and we cannot afford to neglect any part of the territory; together, we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to prove that the classic, multi-level model of our society is sufficiently sound. Full employment, a qualified workforce, lifelong training and increased productivity are essential prerequisites if economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU is to be a success. For this to happen, these factors must be embraced by all of us in a spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives due prominence to the factors of investment in innovation and researchers by means of incentives to encourage such talented people to remain in Europe, and the setting up of centres of excellence; these are vital tools for economic development in the regions and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an increasing awareness of the need to decentralise knowledge hot-spots, away from the large population centres towards the less populated areas. Such areas may prove highly conducive to the establishment of centres of excellence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament has acted with the greatest possible speed in preparing the Community’s strategic guidelines, and now it is up to the Member States to draw up the best, most credible and most feasible national development plans possible, and to submit these to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to draw attention to a few aspects of the document which did not receive much emphasis earlier, and which therefore did not constitute the same sort of incentive when the Member States were drawing up their own development plans. I would like first to mention the part of the document which stresses the broad participation and involvement of the various civil and professional organisations, and urges giving equal say to all in the process of preparing Member States’ national development plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The perspective according to which health is considered an economic value and a motor of development represents a great advance in the document, which recommends the same approach in preparing national development plans. Today health no longer means simply improving the health care system or making it more accessible, but includes creating more and better jobs, the goals of sustainable development as well as the principle of equal opportunity already mentioned. The attention to improving the transparency and accountability of European Union support is a very important step forward, and thus strengthens trust among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know what an enormous job it is to prepare such a document. For my part, I can only thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Olbrycht, for their excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this in view, we should emphasise the actions that will have a long-term impact, such as those carried out not only within the transport and environment sectors, but also in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, regarding support for SMEs and the cross-border labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable, however, that, in this quest for balanced development, the border regions underpinning regional policy should sometimes be very different entities in terms of size and population and may have significant disparities linked to the statistical nomenclature. That can in fact result in unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds, and there is, then, a great risk that strengthening the competitiveness of these cross-border regions – one of the priorities of cooperation – might turn into a form of fierce competition among neighbouring regions. The inequalities in development that could result on both sides of the borders would be liable to harm the European Union’s cohesion policy, even though one of the aims of this policy is to mitigate the negative effect of having borders.</p>
<p class="contents">How, in this case, can we enable the citizens concerned to recognise the added value of the European Union? It is therefore imperative that we create the ideal conditions for balanced cross-border economic and social development and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving this cross-border cooperation.</p>

Like everybody else, I compliment the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl.</p>
<p class="contents">As an Irish Member of the European Parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in 15 years from the weakest in the EU to one of the strongest, I wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the ‘Celtic Tiger’. The EUR 308 billion for 2007-2013 will go largely to the new Member States. Ireland’s entitlement is reduced from EUR 3.7 billion for 2000-2006 to EUR 901 million, which is a barometer of our economic success. I have no problem with that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to ask my colleagues in the new Member States not to give their national governments the power to decide at central government level how and where the money is to be spent. They need regional structures with real development power, real decision-making powers for the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak from experience. I represent a constituency in Ireland known as the BMW region. It is one of the poorest regions, bordering the Atlantic Ocean and largely mountainous. It is still the only region in Ireland that retains Objective 1 status, though that, through national economic performance, ceases on 31 December 2006. Over the years, funds that flowed from the cohesion and structural funds and were intended for regions such as mine were channelled to Dublin, the east and the south of the country and co-financed national development plans. I do not exaggerate. EUR 680 million of co-financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin, the east and the south. Why? Because in Ireland there is no regional authority with real decision-making powers. Everything is decided in Dublin at central government level.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for the new Member States to ensure that they have real regional authorities – not just paper tigers – otherwise they may find that the Irish experience will be their experience tomorrow. Commissioner Hübner reiterated that this evening. I think it should happen, it must happen, and the Commission has a role here as well in insisting that it does happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report was a vital factor in the Council welcoming a number of Parliament's positions, on issues such as sustainable development, the urban dimension, equal opportunities and renewable energy sources. For this and other reasons, Mrs Krehl is justified in recommending that Parliament vote in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this Council decision has been adopted, the Member States will not have much time to submit their strategies for implementing the Structural Funds, incorporating these Community guidelines, to the Commission. It is regrettable that this tight schedule may adversely affect the implementation of the new cohesion policy as of January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that I endorse the proposed guidelines and priorities, and in particular the idea that cohesion policy is a vital tool for implementing the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, however, that the Lisbon Strategy is primarily based on the notion of promoting European competitiveness, as opposed to the notion of solidarity on which the cohesion policy is based. It will not always be easy to work with these two different approaches in tandem, but a balance needs to be struck.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I have serious doubts about the idea of obliging the old Member States to set aside high percentages of the funds for meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, and, at the same time, to promote an effective cohesion policy, not least in the area of territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust, therefore, that the national strategies to be submitted succeed in achieving the best possible balance between competitiveness and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic progress seen over recent years in the EU-15 Member States that enjoyed cohesion funding represents something of a model for what we can do when EU resources are properly targeted and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States, I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs, which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, we welcomed their membership for various reasons, not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy. We welcomed enlargement in the political sense. However, we also recognised that if enlargement was to work it would be necessary to provide adequate funding for the new Member States in order to boost their economies, thereby creating growth and jobs. I am pleased that we are using tried and tested mechanisms of structural and cohesion funding to achieve that important goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom Government announced last year that it would offer an extra EUR 8 billion over the 2007-2013 budget period to help the new Member States build their economies and societies. While my constituents in Northern Ireland recognised that enlargement would bring with it a financial burden on the richer Member States, they were also keen to ensure that funding is allocated in ways that will bring sustainable improvement throughout the entire European Union. We appreciate that the economic development of eastern Europe will in the longer term bring economic advantages for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone from Northern Ireland, I would just like to say that the people there were very envious of the cohesion funding received by the Republic of Ireland, because it certainly helped that country. It is an awful pity that Parliament, the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, the adoption of this document has been greatly postponed in comparison with the original timetable. National materials are now ready in most Member States and logically this document cannot be formally implemented while they are being drawn up. This will lead to further complications throughout the process. Concerning the implications for the preparation of operational programmes and their necessary adoption by the Commission, we should be aware that the programming will now be delayed, thereby postponing the prospect of risk-free draw-downs of financial resources from the Structural Funds for individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it must be said that these strategic principles take on board the great majority of our comments. I am especially pleased that the crucial role of local authorities in particular, that is to say the towns and cities, has not been overlooked in the process of improving competitiveness across the Community as a whole. I feel that this declaration will not merely gather dust, and that we will all strive to ensure that the principle of partnership between national administrations, regions, communities and other entities is fully honoured in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is still much work to be done on explaining certain aspects such as, for example, the programming method for the urban dimension. In future, the form of the integrated urban plans must be clarified, so that there is no miscommunication and so that the goalposts are not moved, as was the case with the release of aid aimed at improving municipally-owned waterworks infrastructure in the Czech Republic. I should like to conclude with a vote of thanks to Mrs Krehl. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is in spite of the fact that the new Member States actually have some of the highest rates of economic growth. With the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, whose GDP stands at a third of the current EU average, I believe that we now need the strategic guidelines on cohesion more than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">European solidarity is referred to in the preamble of the Treaty on the European Union, which specifies that the Community will strengthen its economic and social cohesion with a view, above all, to reducing differences in the level of development between different regions. The EU earmarks over a third of its budget to reducing differences in development between different regions, as well as inequalities in the standard of living. Through the fund, the EU is contributing towards the development of regions that are lagging behind, the restructuring of industrial regions and the revitalisation of neglected urban areas. The reform of cohesion policy should offer the opportunity for greater effectiveness, transparency and political accountability. In the next programming period, cohesion policy must be clearer and more coherent and I personally expect it to become more goal-orientated and focused. Concerning the countries in receipt of support from the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds, it is necessary to take account of enlargement and to distinguish between the various kinds of action supported by the funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking in particular of certain provisions that are now enshrined in the regulations and which cannot, by definition, be contradicted in the guidelines. Certainly earmarking is perhaps the principal example of such a provision which Parliament has tended to oppose, but let me emphasise very strongly that earmarking is not anti-cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a recognition that the world has changed and that we need to redirect efforts towards new priorities in order to achieve sustainable cohesion. At the same time, compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, the final list of earmark categories has been enlarged during the negotiations to include other expenditures, especially in the convergence regions, but not only those regions. In addition, the regulations now provide for the possibility, during the programme negotiations, for the national authorities and the Commission to agree to earmark other expenditure categories that do not appear on the final list, where these are held to be of national or regional importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now on the home strait with regard to the implementation of the EU cohesion policy. We have the regulations in place and by the beginning of October, assuming Parliament’s assent tomorrow, the guidelines will be adopted as a first phase in the programming exercise. While it is the home strait, we should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead in reaching the finishing line, but I can assure you that I will spare no efforts in persuading our partners in the Member States and regions to put in place ambitious and innovative programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The essence and the real achievement of the agreement, from the perspective of the regions, micro-regions and cities of the new Member States, is that their situation has convincingly improved. Sources can be used:</p>
<p class="contents">– with greater certainty (counting with greater certainty on a 2007 start, and planning on full operation)</p>
<p class="contents">– with greater ease (with much less individual effort and more favourable regulations)</p>
<p class="contents">– in a customised fashion (new specific goals such as home renovations, mass transit, road building).</p>
<p class="contents">Areas of development are expanding, there is greater freedom of choice in their uses and value – this significantly increases our chances for dynamic growth and cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of 27 countries, mine ranks second highest in the amount of cohesion/convergence support per head, out of which development worth at least 8 billion Ft can be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">In the regulations aimed at our cohesion and thus in the strategic guidelines as well, the majority of Hungary’s requests and proposed amendments formulated in the committees of Parliament and the Council received support, indeed we even received things we did not request or even hope for.</p>
<p class="contents">All the conditions are present for the regions of Europe that are still lagging behind to align themselves with the front line. Continued success depends on whether we manage to build our country with the kind of collaboration one finds in Brussels, and whether we will be able to deal with the real issues, so that instead of futile arguments, we will be able to raise Hungary and the other new Member States to the rank of Europe’s top players.
