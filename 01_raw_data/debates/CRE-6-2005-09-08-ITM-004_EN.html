<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commissioner.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted about the opportunity offered to us in this Chamber to debate the policy relating to the Northern Dimension and to do so in advance of the meeting of ministers on 21 November, which will be devoted to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension is an integrated policy of the European Union. Its purpose is to encourage dialogue and practical cooperation in the northern parts of Europe comprising the Baltic region and the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas of our continent. It is designed to ensure the general well-being of this vast region endowed with many natural resources and to do so by means of effective and long-lasting regional cooperation. It also makes it possible to overcome the divisions experienced within a region whose constituent parts have very many shared characteristics and which has to face common challenges on both sides of the borders of the states concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Northern Dimension policy has moved on considerably since its launch in 1999, when it was officially inaugurated by the Helsinki European Council. The Feira European Council of June 2000 then incorporated the initial action plan for the Northern Dimension, extending over the period 2000-2003, into the European Union’s external and cross-border policies. The Brussels European Council of October 2003 supported the second action plan in favour of the Northern Dimension, which entered into force on 1 January 2004 and covers the period 2004-2006. This second plan took account of the European Union’s enlargement, set for 1 May 2004. Since that date, eight of the nine Baltic Sea states have been members of the European Union. The ninth is the Russian Federation. Even before that, Northern Dimension policy had placed ever greater emphasis upon relations and cooperation with North-West Russia, an aspect that will certainly be reinforced in the years after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The second action plan relates to five areas deemed essential to the northern countries: the economic side of trade and infrastructure, the development of human resources – education, culture, research and health – the environment and nuclear safety, cross-border cooperation and, finally, justice and home affairs. Moreover, Kaliningrad and the Arctic are considered as cross-disciplinary themes to be integrated into the five priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan emphasises the notions of subsidiarity and of dynamic interplay between the various actors in the Northern Dimension. These two ideas guarantee full participation by all the parties in implementing the action plan, the parties concerned being, in particular, the partner states, the regional organisations, the regional and local authorities, the educational establishments and research institutes and, finally, civil society, not forgetting the EU itself. In particular, I should like to stress the importance of the role played by the CBSS (Council of Baltic Sea States) and the BEAC (Barents Euro-Arctic Council), as well as the councils’ activities and projects. The Commission is a member of these two organisations and remains fully involved with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning, the initiatives adopted within the framework of the Northern Dimension have been implemented thanks to the existing Community programmes or to the respective budgets of the parties concerned with this dimension, whether they be states or regional organisations. At present, the European Union’s financial instruments devoted to Northern Dimension policy are the TACIS programmes, the national and regional programmes, including what are known as the neighbourhood programmes, Interreg and, to a lesser degree, the other Community policies affecting the Northern Dimension indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension also benefits from the greater scope for loans granted to Russia by the European Investment Bank. The Commission has proposed that, as from 2007, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, that is to say one of the four new instruments for funding external actions, constitute the main source of Community funding for Russia and, hence, for Northern Dimension policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional framework put in place by the second action plan has operated as anticipated, with ministerial meetings organised every two years and, in between, meetings of senior officials. The first meeting of senior officials took place in Brussels on 21 October 2004 and brought the following together: all the states involved with the Northern Dimension, together with all the other Member States of the European Union; the four Northern region organisations, that is to say the Council of Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Arctic Council; the international financial institutions operating in Northern Europe; and representatives of the European Union institutions. Canada and the United States have also taken part as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2005 ministerial meeting, which will be held on 21 November in Brussels on the initiative of the British Presidency, will be important as its purpose will be to approve the guidelines for preparing a political statement and a framework document for implementing the policy to be considered in the years following 2006, that is to say upon expiry of the second action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, the main objective must be to make Northern Dimension policy a policy common to all the parties concerned, notably the Russian Federation. If this new Northern Dimension policy is to be a success, all the parties, and Russia in particular, need to feel fully involved. That also presupposes an unqualified commitment to the objectives and structures concerned with this dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Once all the parties have demonstrated this commitment, we could envisage new partnerships in the Northern region, inspired by the successful model provided by the environmental partnership in the Northern Dimension, for which the European Union is the main provider of funds and which illustrates the very fruitful cooperation established between the four international financial institutions concerned, Russia and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission’s point of view, the new Northern Dimension must be considered as the form of regional expression to the north of the Common Spaces agreed at the summit on 10 May between the European Union and the Russian Federation – regional expression that would be enhanced by full participation on the part of Norway and Iceland. It should also continue to include a number of additional objectives related to the specific characteristics of the North, in particular its fragile environment and the issue of native populations, as well as issues of health and social well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is at present preparing the basic documents concerning the new Northern Dimension. These should consist of a common political statement and a strategic framework setting out the objectives and listing the measures required for achieving them. These documents should be approved during the second half of 2006 following a very extensive process of consultation involving everyone concerned with this dimension, in particular the four northern region organisations, the international financial institutions operating in this same region, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The documents should enter into force in 2007 upon expiry of the second action plan. The political statement and strategic framework related to the new dimension should be permanent in character, replacing the current model of three-year action plans while necessarily remaining subject to regular review. By way of facilitating these periodic reviews, the idea is also that, in future, everyone involved in the Northern Dimension should present assessments at the Northern Dimension ministerial meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultations on the new strategy have begun, and I am delighted at the opportunity they offer me to exchange views with Parliament. The Commission will gladly listen to any new idea or suggestion from Parliament about the development of this strategy and will also keep Parliament fully informed of this development. As for the Commission, it will continue to prepare annual reports. The information system concerning the Northern Dimension is also available on the Relex DG web site.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by expressing the hope that the discussions we are currently conducting with Russia will lead to Russia committing itself unreservedly to the new phase on which the Northern Dimension strategy will embark in 2007. I also wish to emphasise that the Commission is fully determined to go on working to make this strategy succeed, both by implementing the second action plan and by developing the strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you look at the list of speakers, however, you notice one substantial problem associated with this concept: up till now the Northern Dimension has been the concern of far too few people. Too few in Parliament and the EU Member States feel it has to do with them. The programme has not yet produced the results that were hoped for, and many people still know very little about it. This major initiative of the Finnish Presidency in 1999 is far too worthwhile a project to be lost simply because of a lack of political clout. The Northern Dimension must be made more viable, and I am grateful that a Member of the Commission should have the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from attracting very little attention, the Northern Dimension has been given very little money. Not having its own budget line, it has remained theoretical. If sums are compared with the financing which the EU has provided for the Mediterranean, they obviously amount to just a fraction of that, but I am delighted to hear about new financial instruments. The Northern Dimension has suffered from a certain lack of identity, and so far has been unable to create a clear profile for itself that distinguishes it from other programmes. We should be realistic: only a strategy with a clear financial framework and a budget line will succeed in establishing its status. This is one reason why some of us representatives of the Nordic countries have recently been looking in the direction of the Baltic Sea and the countries on its coastline. The Baltic Sea is unquestionably part of the Northern Dimension. With the eastward enlargement of the EU, the Baltic became almost completely an internal sea of the European Union, and it should be accorded the importance it deserves. It is our sea: <span class="italic">mare nostrum</span>. Surrounding it are new Member States of the EU which are highly motivated to strengthen cooperation in the Baltic region so that all the important elements of the Northern Dimension are reinforced and new political muscle is used for regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension has been a tool of external relations, but the separate elements of its sphere of operation have not benefited sufficiently from factors that would unite it. It now needs a new approach that would unify the region. This is where Baltic Sea conservation and development of the Baltic Sea economic region are important. When we first joined the EU it might have been enough if we were able to have an impact on verbal reality and at least some people repeated the words and ideas we expressed. That is no longer enough; as the Union expands and as, at the same time, the need is great, I want the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea strategy to become a research project that will benefit the people who live in the region and one of environmental conservation.</p>

The enlarged European Union needs visibility in its various geographical regions. It is widely recognised in the European Union that there has to be visible action in the Mediterranean region to maintain people’s security and welfare and our continent’s steady and sustainable development. The Northern Dimension is a later arrival in the sphere of EU activity. It has been a part of Union policy, as decided by the Council, since the German Presidency in 1999. As has been said here, however, commitment to this policy on the part of the Commission and the Member States has been very unsatisfactory, and it was very interesting and satisfying to hear the Commissioner’s assurance that there is to be a change with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s most recent round of enlargement also raises the matter of the need for a new Eastern Dimension. The Northern Dimension is an umbrella arrangement designed to try to give attention not only to the Union’s northern regions but also to its northern neighbouring regions, in the form, for example, of practical cooperation with the northwestern part of Russia and the Arctic regions. The practical work of the Northern Dimension is based on partnerships in which the European Union and Russia, Norway and Iceland are participants. Canada, too, is involved in many projects. The practical work of the Northern dimension is based on partnerships, and the best example of this is the realisation of environmental partnerships and the way these have come about could serve as an example to all the other EU regional projects. In short, the contribution of EUR 75 million by the partnership countries and the EU has meant we have been able to start or we have planned environmental projects worth EUR 2 billion. This autumn a sewage works southwest of St Petersburg will be completed. It will have considerable importance for reducing the waste load in the Baltic Sea. In the future we will have to develop a Northern Dimension policy, get new bodies and agencies involved in it, and provide support for the work of earlier partners. As the Commissioner said, the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Regional Council are all important players in the Northern Dimension. Most important of all, however, is the Commission’s own commitment and that of the Member States. The Northern Dimension must be made a reality so that it can genuinely become a part of our common policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about the future – what comes after 2006 – that there is much concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last six years, I have had the privilege to represent this Parliament on a number of parliamentary bodies in the Arctic, Barents and Baltic region. It is quite clear that our parliamentary colleagues on those bodies look to this Parliament and the European Union to provide a robust and functioning Northern Dimension policy. It is somewhat ironic that this is a policy that is normally played out at a regional level and it is therefore absolutely essential that it involves elected Members and all other stakeholders, as the Commissioner has said.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is a policy that tends to be set at the biannual ministerial meetings. Therefore this Parliament has sometimes suggested that some form of Northern Dimension forum, bringing in all the stakeholders and elected representatives, would be a good idea for the future. We must give this policy bottom-up motion so that it is really working and dynamic and represents the wishes of the area it is there to serve. Also, the original Northern Dimension had a wide vision of a policy from the Urals to Greenland, encompassing the Arctic and the subarctic region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that we concentrate much effort on our relationship with Russia, and there is much that can be done there. If we have a dynamic St Petersburg, then the Baltic itself will be dynamic and that even reflects on trade in the area I know best – the north-east coast of the United Kingdom. So it can benefit all of us and we must take an interest. However, it must be a shared policy in partnership with Russia, not a covert way of directing some EU policy towards Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, we must also bring in our other partners, Norway and Iceland. The Norwegian Government has recently produced a very full policy document for discussion on the High North. It wants European Union involvement. We should respond to that. This fragile area of our world gives us the opportunity to cooperate with many partners and even to have dialogue with the US on climate change. We should seize that opportunity within a wider Northern Dimension policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Baltic Sea is a part of the Northern Dimension which is connected with both. As has already been said, since enlargement it has become almost entirely an internal sea of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic is one of the most vulnerable areas of sea in the world, and at present it is in very poor shape. None of this is visible from the surface, however. The often repeated depressing fact is that the largest stretch of wasteland in Europe lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. It is actually a vast zone devoid of oxygen, where the basic living organisms have died. The Baltic is fairly large in area but it is shallow. The average depth is only 58 metres, while that of the Mediterranean, for example, is several kilometres. The pollution load reaching the Baltic, however, is high. Approximately 0.5% of the world’s people live in its catchment area, although around 10% of the world’s sea traffic passes through it. The number of oil consignments from ports in Russia in particular is increasing very rapidly. We know that a major oil tanker accident is a catastrophe wherever it may occur. In the Baltic Sea, however, the consequences would be vastly more disastrous and longer-term than in the Atlantic. Eutrophication in the Baltic is visible in the summer, for example, in the form of blue-green algae. The greatest cause of this is agriculture. Environmental toxicity levels are high: for example, levels of contamination in seals and white-tailed eagles are approximately five times greater than in the Atlantic. Some of these problems can only be solved in collaboration with Russia, but some, such as agricultural emissions, are matters the resolution of which is in the hands of the European Union and its Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Winds blow into its sails from every direction, not least from where our partners are in the Northern Dimension: Russia, Norway and Iceland. This is sometimes forgotten by our southern friends in the Mediterranean region. Russia is a rich country, where there are a lot of poor people. The country has drifted into a state of chaos, in a way which we humanists cannot behold with indifference: there are street children and prostitutes, criminals and terrorists, and there are huge environmental problems. Russia’s state of health is reflected in the fact that the country’s population is falling by a million a year. It would be good if the Commissioner put on headphones, as I do not suppose he understands Finnish.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to help this neighbour state of the EU solve its problems with funding, for example, under TACIS and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership programmes, under the umbrella of the Northern Dimension. We need a new and better Northern Dimension action programme, which must be drafted together with Russia. Now that the good Commissioner is listening, I will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension must not, however, be merely a matter of helping Russia: it needs to be a means of cooperation. There needs to be a belief in good intentions on either side. The Northern Dimension must also cover cooperation with oil-rich Norway and energy-rich Iceland. Its action plan should extend into the northern region to include Greenland and Alaska, to say nothing of the Barents Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, there should be closer cooperation with the regional councils. The fact that the EU does not always take part in the meetings of the Arctic Council, the Barents Council or the Barents Euro-Arctic Council says something about its indifferent approach to external relations in the development of the Northern Dimension. The Commission should take seriously the desire of the EU’s northern Member States to develop Europe’s northern regions alongside the Mediterranean region, and the Commissioner should listen to the debate through his headphones if he does not understand the language. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are to vote on many such objectionable proposals later today. When it comes to the Northern Dimension, it is therefore, in my view, very important for us to concentrate on results-oriented activity and not on everything under heaven and earth that is north of the fiftieth degree of latitude.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is important in the Northern Dimension over the next ten or fifteen years? Generally speaking, I agree entirely with all the previous speakers that the answer is the Baltic Sea. What is more, I would add that the nuclear plants outside Saint Petersburg give rise to one of those topical issues that are genuinely of extreme importance. It should be noted that, in both cases, Russia has a crucial role to play. It is a matter, therefore, of cultivating the contact we have with Russia and developing it in both these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic is an absolutely unique inland sea. There is no comparison with the Mediterranean or, indeed, any other sea in the world. The Baltic consists of brackish water, meaning that flora and fauna that are actually suited to salty sea water or fresh water are in constant danger. The salt content goes up or down depending on how the water flows through the Sound. That makes the Baltic incredibly sensitive because, as quite a few speakers have pointed out, it is a shallow sea. The Baltic cannot cope with pollution, yet around the Baltic there is now intensive economic activity and intensive agriculture with a host of discharges. This means that our efforts should be directed at, for example, rescuing flora and fauna, cleaning up after discharges, monitoring marine transport and closing down the Saint Petersburg nuclear plants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? In spite of the fact that it is welcome that the Northern Dimension is applied to the Baltic Sea region with the aim of developing cooperation both within the region and also in the border region from the Baltic Sea towards the east, and that efforts are being made to involve Russia, which is nurturing its understanding of western values, it is time to take a good look at how seriously Russia has taken the Northern Dimension itself and factors connected with it into account so far. It is quite obvious that in the wider context of the region Russia thinks predominantly of its own interests. This is proven by its inability to free itself of imperial thinking, based on Tsar Peter I’s approach to Europe, in the 17th century, of forcing a breach, continuing right up to its inability to accept the independence regained by the Baltic states and their equal membership of the Baltic Sea region within the context of development and security. As a result, the facilities developed in the Baltic Sea are completely inadequate in terms of meeting the Northern Dimension’s goals: for example, the transport and energy systems and the new ports at St Petersburg, which not only complicate the environmental situation, but make it more expensive for European Union consumers to obtain natural resources in the northern region. As a result, ships and tankers’ routes are lengthening, traffic in the Baltic Sea is continuing to increase and in the near future will double or treble, the cost of raw materials is increasing and there are growing risks of shipping collisions in the Baltic Sea. All this should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to place particular emphasis on the fact that Russia has a special need to foster democracy, since, unfortunately, it is absolutely clear that the current Russian regime is ignoring this extremely important objective. Only once Russia has managed to solve these problems will we be able to hope that the Northern Dimension will achieve its technical and economic objectives in relation to Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are talking about the <span class="italic">Northern</span> Dimension, not the <span class="italic">Nordic</span> Dimension. There is a rather substantial difference. There are four Nordic countries; the Northern Dimension encompasses the whole north of Europe. It is important to remember that when drawing up the agenda next time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Northern Dimension stands at a crossroads. It has two options. One is that it withers away under the Russian road map and becomes just a part of it. The second is that we start refocusing it, for instance towards the Baltic Sea. I happen to have a preference for the second option.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy that the Commission is dealing with the matter today and that we are able to discuss it. I am also very happy to see that there are other non-Finns in the Chamber besides Mrs Wallis, who was the only non-Finn to speak about the subject in November 2003. So the concept is moving forward and that is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three observations. Firstly, I think that the Northern Dimension should have its own budget line. I firmly believe that it needs it. If it is put under the neighbourhood policy I think it will only get crumbs from the general budget. So give it its own budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think we need to rejuvenate the Northern Dimension, give it more content than before. The ideas that Commissioner Michel put forward are a step in the right direction. However, I fully agree with, for example, Mrs Korhola and Mrs Hassi, who said that we should refocus it on the Baltic Sea, because that probably is the sickest sea we have in Europe today. To all the people sitting in the Parliament for the first time today, just remember that the Baltic Sea has an average depth of 59 metres compared to the two to three kilometres of the Mediterranean. If there were to be an oil accident, that would be the end of the Baltic Sea, and I am sure no one would like to see that happen. So let us get more focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to start coordinating the institutions that are dealing with the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea region. We need more coordination between the Nordic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Baltic Sea Council. They need to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commissioner one final question. Do you not think it would be a good idea to have a Northern Dimension as the overarching concept, but a Baltic Sea strategy as an underlying theme working within the Northern Dimension? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a considerable importance for this sort of cooperation between people and various organisations, and it has importance specifically for regional security, welfare and stability. The Northern Dimension should be included in all the EU’s policies and not remain a separate heading. It was good to hear that the Commissioner agrees. Whether it is a matter of the environment, health or culture, everything also has its northern dimension in the same way the EU’s policy on the Mediterranean does.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s northeastern border is at least as crucially important as its border in the southern Mediterranean. The standard-of-living gap in the north is the widest in Europe. On the Russian side, the economic and health statistics are on a par with Africa. HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, drugs and alcoholism have lowered life expectancy in males to levels in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the hundreds of projects, those which stand out most clearly are the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership and the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being. The aim of the latest programme is the control of these infectious diseases and the prevention of various dangers to society in our neighbouring areas: which will be no minor feat in the future either. Mr President, the EU’s best investments in the environment and in health are still being made behind Finland’s eastern border, and it is on that border that the interests of the whole of the EU are being watched over above all by the Finns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially gratifying is the fact that Russia’s attitude towards it is becoming more positive than what it was before. In order to develop the Northern Dimension’s importance in the Union’s external relations the Commission should be given two tasks. Firstly, not only Russia but also our northern European Economic Area partners, Iceland and Norway, should be strongly encouraged to be involved in cooperation in the northern regions and, for example, the new EU Neighbourhood Policy. Secondly, the Commission should participate more dynamically in the work of the councils that operate in the northernmost region of the earth: the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Arctic Council.</p>
<p class="contents">My main message, however, is connected with what is missing from the Commission’s report entirely: cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. Until spring of last year, the Baltic countries and Poland were our neighbours and partners in external relations. Now they have joined the Union the development of the Baltic Sea region is essentially based on mutual cooperation between the Member States and the Union’s internal policy. The Commission needs to take this into account when shaping the guidelines for the Northern Dimension. Now that our Northern Dimension partners have gone from just being neighbours to being members, a comprehensive strategy for developing the Baltic Sea region should be drawn up, within the framework of which the Member States and the Commission can collaborate on projects such as improving environmental conservation and the energy economy in the region as well as its internal communications. Baltic Sea cooperation will establish the Northern Dimension in the Union’s internal policies, but cooperation with Russia will obviously still be conducted as part of the Northern Dimension of external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Baltic Sea cooperation will finally contribute some real substance to those views of the Council which have emphasised the importance of the Northern Dimension generally and also in the internal development of the Union. There should be some reorganisation in the Commission so that it is not only the External Relations Directorate-General that deals with questions relating to the Northern Dimension but other Directorate-Generals as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also join with others in saluting the initiative taken by the Finnish Government. It is also good to remark, as colleagues have said, that this debate is attended by French, German, Austrian, Belgian, British and other colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is timely, as has been said, that we extend the work of the Northern Dimension to encompass a Baltic Sea strategy, which is a true reflection of today's reality, the Baltic bordered by eight EU Member States and the Russian Federation. In this Parliament there is a Baltic Europe intergroup, which meets every month in Strasbourg and which I have the honour to chair. It encompasses members not only from each political group but also representing the great majority of Member States. We have been working to produce a Baltic Sea strategy. Yesterday we had the honour to meet with President-in-Office and Minister for Europe Mr Alexander. We are extremely grateful for his enthusiasm and interest in the project leading up to the ministerial meeting on 21 November on the Northern dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel, I would urge you – perhaps in your reply – just to confirm that the Commission, you and your colleagues will be working extremely closely with the British Presidency to ensure the successful initiation and implementation of the Baltic Sea strategy, which will be seen as a natural extension – a complement – to the work of the Northern Dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholly agree with others, that we shall have a discreet budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy to match and balance the very successful work that we do through the Euromed policy, which – obviously – historically predates the work in the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of this work cannot be underestimated: its importance ranks in the very highest policy that the EU should now be developing. What we are talking about is nothing less than offsetting and overcoming half a century of Soviet occupation, oppression, misrule and marginalisation. We are pledged to restore the economic harmony, security, prosperity and cultural vibrancy of the Baltic region. To ensure the success of this work, it is absolutely vital that the British, German, Polish, French and Italian Governments and the whole of the EU administration lend their support to this great work. We want to see a truly successful enlarged European Union. That will not happen unless we have a successful Baltic Sea strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> Last year’s enlargement of the EU has a very great effect upon the Northern Dimension. The Baltic Sea region, which comprises all of eight Member States, now forms the very heart of the Northern Dimension. It is a region with great potential for economic development and urgent challenges in, for example, the area of environmental policy, which must become part of the agenda for the whole of the EU. The people there expect a policy that makes it possible to make full use of the region’s potential, a factor that must also be taken into account in the EU’s policy on Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Parliament set up what are known as its intergroups, the group that was to deal with the Baltic region as a whole was one of the most popular, which is a sign of just how much demand there is for such cooperation. That being said, there is a lack of shared awareness and, consequently, of solidarity and a common sense of identity in the region. We must now take steps to heal this wound following the division of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic must become a matter for the whole of the EU. A flourishing EU needs a flourishing Baltic region, and the region needs the EU in order to be able to solve a range of problems, environmental as well as social and economic.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for Russia to get involved in the cooperation taking place under the banner of the Northern Dimension. It would be of symbolic importance to support Saint Petersburg so that, in future, all the waste water from the city might be cleaned up, so benefiting everyone living in the Baltic region. The population of that region expects such obvious problems to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the Northern Dimension has often been seen as an issue internal to Finland. It is also regrettable that Baltic cooperation, which is important, has in a way fallen outside the Northern Dimension, in spite of the fact that Baltic cooperation is an essential part of that dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the Commission to succeed now in properly strengthening the Baltic side of the Northern Dimension. It must be possible to do a better job of coordinating research in the region and directing it at issues of common concern. Important infrastructure projects can bind the region together. We also need an extensive exchange of students and labour. Energy supplies must become more diverse. My message to the Commissioner is this: incorporate the Baltic as an important part of the Northern Dimension. Draw up a bold strategy for the region, and be more daring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, the Northern dimension was an ambitious initiative when it was proposed by the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, eight years ago. Under the first Finnish Presidency it succeeded in turning the EU's attention towards north-eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Baltic Sea has become an internal sea of the EU, uniting an extremely promising region of 85 million inhabitants with immense economic potential. I should like to make three observations.</p>
<p class="contents">My first concern is related to the highly alarming ecological situation of the Baltic Sea, where environmental and toxic hazards are often up to five times higher than in the North Sea area. These growing risks and challenges need to be addressed by more cohesive and long-term policies, using the resources of the EU as a whole. It is high time, therefore, to widen the concept of the Northern dimension beyond cooperation projects with Russia's north-west regions, to cover the whole area of the Baltic Sea including the Kaliningrad area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, within the Northern dimension, we should have a special Baltic Sea strategy, just as there is an EU strategy for the Mediterranean. The time has come to draw practical conclusions from the enlargement of the EU to the east and north-east. Clearly, we need a much more creative and balanced approach to these areas, including the creation of concrete financial instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, one of the core elements of the Northern dimension is cooperation with Russia. The efficiency and reliability of the EU common foreign policy are being particularly tested in this region. Despite the European Parliament's May resolution on Russia, which called on Member States to resist Russia's attempts to differentiate between old and new Members, unfortunately the date of 8 September stands as a symbol of the separate relations between Russia and some larger Member States. The so-called Schröder-Putin agreement will officially start the building of a new under-sea gas pipeline between Germany and Russia, solidifying the special relationship between those two countries. The side effect of that project would be to expose Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine to the Russian practice of using economic pressure to advance its foreign policy aims.</p>
<p class="contents">If its long-term cooperation with Russia is to be successful, the EU needs to start sending a clear and coherent signal to Moscow. Our first priority must be to convince Russian policy-makers that we take our own common foreign policy seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Purchasing power has not only advantages but also disadvantages, and so we have to consider in what areas we want to include this new dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw particular attention to energy policy. I regard the Baltic region in particular as a region with a future, and as one that is of the utmost importance to us. Countries such as Norway, with its reserves of crude oil and natural gas, and Iceland, with its renewable geothermal energy, are examples for us to follow in this respect and present us with an immense opportunity to develop common strategies for energy policy in this area; I believe that the current state of energy prices – for both oil and gas – means that this will be one of the most important issues in the future. Not only in that respect, but also as regards the security of our energy supply, this area will, in future, have a special part to play.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say that the infrastructure, too, presents us with a vitally important challenge, I am referring not only to the energy infrastructure, but also to such things as telecommunications. Tasks such as developing broadband technology and ensuring access to information on the Internet by a wider cross-section of society will in future have an important part to play in the future, particularly in remote regions.</p>
<p class="contents">A primary concern in cross-border cooperation is economic in nature – to bring together small and medium-sized businesses. The need to create jobs and to attempt to raise the standard of living in these regions make it particularly important that our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and of cooperation above all, should take no account of borders.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me on to a really fundamental issue, that of the WTO and Russia. I believe it to be crucial to the Hong Kong talks in particular that we should join together with Russia in considering a common strategy as regards global lawmaking. I regard this dimension as being of particular importance to us in terms of our trade relations, and the importance to Europe of the further development of the WTO structures will be consistent with this. A very interesting debate is currently going on in this region about how we can join together in adapting to the new situations in the global context, and that I see as being the real challenge for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the speakers who, overall, reacted very positively to the statement I made on behalf of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner. I should like to point out that it is she who deserves the credit because I was speaking on her behalf, and I shall be sure to convey this general feeling of support to her. I shall also pass on all the suggestions and reflections expressed that do not necessarily relate to the statement, in particular those concerning the place and role of Russia and cooperation with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian economy shows encouraging growth, so it is likely that European Union budgets will not increase in this area. However, the Commission does not dismiss the possibility of new partnerships if Russia commits itself formally to the Northern Dimension. I would just add that, in my view, the comparison with the Mediterranean is not entirely appropriate, given the different characteristics of the two regions, particularly with regard to economic indicators, the populations concerned and the number of countries involved etc.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to Russia, the Commission is receptive to that country’s proposals and contributions. Russia needs to be present at the ministerial meeting about the Northern Dimension, to be held on 21 November 2005, and then to participate fully in the entire range of the Northern Dimension’s activities. Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, as witnessed to by the positive conclusions of the summit of 10 May and by the adoption of the road maps for the four Common Spaces. Our objective consists of devising a joint European Union-Russia policy on the Northern Dimension, also involving Norway and Iceland. This policy should be in keeping with the Common Spaces, with which it should be aligned in terms of the Northern region, and it should have a number of specific characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now say something about specific funding. I think that the European Community should continue to support the Northern Dimension within the framework of the programmes at present being implemented, that is to say TACIS and the European Neighbourhood Policy, and of those to be implemented in the future within the framework of the draft European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. It should also be noted that what will also be useful in terms of infrastructure is the fact that the opportunities for loans by the European Investment Bank to Russia and the western NIS (newly independent states) have recently been increased. Thanks to the practical support from<span class="bold"> </span>a wide range of donors, the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership<span class="bold"> </span>is showing how useful it is for meeting very specific and urgent needs. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that these results could be reproduced in other areas, but that would require a similar level of commitment from all those providing funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Because it is important, I need to reply to a question I was asked several times, namely that concerning a Baltic strategy within the Northern Dimension. That option obviously has its merits. However, I think that we should, for all that, point out that the Commission is active around the Baltic Sea through the EU’s internal policies. The fact is that, as I mentioned earlier, eight of the nine countries bordering the Baltic are Member States, benefiting from the EU’s internal policies and programmes. There can be no forgetting the far North with its specific characteristics: relatively unpopulated, but with a very large native culture and environmental problems peculiar to itself. I am thinking, for example, of the former Russian nuclear bases on the Kola Peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">Those, then, are the replies we intended giving today. Obviously, though, I shall be very particular in conveying the feelings, reflections and very strong commitment of the MEPs who spoke in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have much to contribute from our own experience, and much to learn as a West-Nordic nation.
