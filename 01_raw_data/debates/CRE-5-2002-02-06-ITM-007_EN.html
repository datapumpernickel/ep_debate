<p class="contents">In our case, within the European Union, we have had the parallel boost of the Council of Europe itself, as well as the standard that we set ourselves, both at national level and at European Union level, in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are recent examples demonstrating this concern, which is part of our own identity, such as the European Charter of Human Rights, the recent Commission communications on the work of the European Union to promote human rights in third countries, the extremely important work undertaken by the European Parliament in this field and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 25 June last year, which state that genuine concern to defend human rights must always be present in the Union’s external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind you of the guidelines, both on torture and on the use of the death penalty, which are constantly taken into account in the drafting of our external policy and in our relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other issues that are also always present in our <span class="italic">acquis</span> and our culture and which are linked to the general trend of respect for human rights in any action or initiative in external policy. These are the principle of non-discrimination against women and the rights of the child and their effective protection.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these concepts do, of course, underpin the work of the European Union during the sessions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and these are the principles that will inform our action in the forthcoming session, which will be held between 18 March and 26 April this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission on Human Rights is, without a doubt, the greatest challenge that the European Union will have to face in the forthcoming months in the field of human rights. This Commission, which – as everyone knows – is a body attached to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, meets every year in Geneva and is a forum for intense debate on all aspects of international current affairs that have some connection or relationship with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, then, an annual exercise, which is mandatory for us and which involves complex preparations and requires the European Union, year after year, to make a constant effort to undertake in the international context something that international society expects of the European Union, which it considers to be the bastion of the defence of these rights and that is the effective and increasingly universal protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that the European Union plays a very active part in the Commission on Human Rights and that a large number of Member States of the European Union are members of the Commission (currently, Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Germany and Sweden). Taking account of our quota in what is known as the ‘Western European Group’, the European Union has, without any doubt, the largest allocation of places.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the enormous complexity of the exercise we are discussing, it is difficult at this time to fix definitive European Union positions with regard to the Commission on Human Rights. These positions are always based on our system of values. This does not mean giving way on any of our principles, but often the positions within the Commission are the product of prior coordination to obtain tangible results, and there are some issues which, because of their sensitivity and the attention they are given by the media, warrant special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, our objective, as in previous years, is to present a series of draft resolutions and statements by the presidency of the Commission on Human Rights, that cover the events to have taken place in the last year, from the close of the 57th session of that body, which was held in April 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the European Union feels that it is necessary to make speeches on highly sensitive issues in which our stance must be reflected in some way. This year, these speeches, which have been prepared with the cooperation of our partners, will focus fundamentally on the following areas: racism, the right to development, the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world, economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights and the rights of women to be fully integrated as well as the gender perspective, children’s rights, human rights lawyers and advice services, and technical cooperation in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The list is extensive, but not exhaustive. It illustrates the broad range of issues that we will have to address in the Commission on Human Rights, where the defence of these rights must be comprehensive and, naturally, is universal.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason, the activity generated by the Commission on Human Rights is linked to many other issues which, in one way or another, impact on the work of the European Union. Firstly, reference must be made to the conventional way in which the Commission on Human Rights has performed and continues to perform its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the exercises to which the European Union will be attaching great priority are the discussions already under way on the drafting of various optional protocols: the protocol on the economic, social and cultural rights pact and the protocol on the Convention against torture, the drawing up of which has made progress at session after session, and which is quite close to being concluded. In both cases, the European Union must undertake serious work on drawing up the drafts and on cooperating with the working parties preceding the Commission meeting, with the aim of facilitating the adoption of these protocols.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as everyone can imagine, we are facing many challenges of a social and humanitarian nature, which we are determined to confront, together with our partners: all the issues of refugees and asylum-seekers, emigration and all its consequences in the cultural, educational and social spheres, the problem of discrimination against indigenous populations, the genuine progress and practical equality of women in all areas, and so many sectors, individual and collective, that are under scrutiny by the<span class="italic"> </span>international community<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In<span class="italic"> </span>the<span class="italic"> </span>Council, we intend to make a very special effort to ensure that our participation is as active and constructive as possible, both at the General Assembly Special Session on Children – which was due to have taken place in September, but which was affected by the events of 11 September, and has been rescheduled, although without a specific date as yet – and at the World Assembly on Ageing, to take place in April of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is worth bearing in mind the debate, which has already begun, on how to improve the highly praiseworthy work of the various committees of independent experts, the so-called ‘Treaty bodies’, which monitor and oversee proper compliance with many of the conventions to which I referred a moment ago. These committees must be given the resources they need to perform their work to their best ability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should also like to mention two issues which, because of their complexity, will affect our work in the Commission on Human Rights: on the one hand, the fight against racism and racial discrimination. As you all know, last September a major world conference was held in Durban (South Africa), whose preparations and workings were not without controversy but at which, ultimately and fortunately, consensus was maintained, following long discussions and, to a large extent, as a result of the perseverance of the European Union delegation as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now exercise special vigilance to ensure that the wounds inflicted in Durban are not reopened and that the consensus that was reached develops genuinely and pragmatically, with the ongoing assistance of the appropriate bodies in the United Nations Secretariat-General.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue is the abolition or restriction of the use of the death penalty. We are all aware that, despite the firm conviction in Europe that the death penalty should be totally eradicated and abolished, some countries belonging to cultural and religious tendencies other than our own continue to uphold and apply it. For our part, we will continue, in a basically humanitarian undertaking, to attempt to extend the scope of its abolition, by strengthening situations of moratoria and the effective non-application of the penalty, even if this exists in a country’s legislation, and by urging the authorities – in very specific cases, of minors, pregnant women and the mentally handicapped – for executions not to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the lines of action we intend to follow, at the right time, in the European Union, by means of approved guidelines on the matter, and which we will continue referring to as often as necessary, especially in the resolution on the death penalty, traditionally presented by the European Union at the Commission on Human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude, Mr President, by offering a thought on the new situation that has arisen from 11 September. I am echoing concerns that I have heard in this Parliament this very morning. In the Presidency and in the Council we are very aware that in many countries a certain climate of concern has evolved over whether, in the quest to strengthen security and the fight against terrorist organisations, the protection of human rights might be substantially damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, and the Council at its head, are convinced that this does not have to happen; that there is absolutely no incompatibility between security and the freedom of our fellow citizens, and that as far as we are concerned, there will be no cutback of fundamental freedoms nor of daily democratic coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the attacks of 11 September were an all-out attack on this system of values and freedoms, of which we are so proud, and which we all have an obligation to defend. The Commission on Human rights will, without doubt, be an ideal setting in which to demonstrate our commitment to respect and protect human rights, to extend this commitment to every country in the world, without allowing the fight against terrorism to be used as a pretext for violating these rights, and to reaffirm that the protection of human rights continues to be as solid a principle as it always has been in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this debate provides the opportunity for an exchange of views prior to the deliberations of the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Contact Group has already brought together representatives of non-governmental organisations, Members of Parliament, civil servants from the EU institutions and others to discuss key concerns for Geneva. The broader the input, the more confident the EU can be in the approach which it adopts at the UN Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As ever, when you invite the Commission to these annual debates, it comes at a time when the EU has not definitively decided upon the initiatives which it will take at the UNCHR and their final form will only be determined after negotiations on the ground in Geneva. Regrettably, there is all too much choice when looking around the world for examples of human rights violations. That is why the EU must adopt a coherent approach when determining the best way to promote respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our communication on human rights of last May, and the subsequent conclusions by the General Affairs Council, set out a strategy for such an approach by an EU that would actively engage with the world in the promotion of human rights through, for example, the human rights clause which forms a regular feature of Community agreements and which finds its most advanced expression in the Cotonou Agreement; through the dialogue which we have undertaken to conduct in contacts with all third countries, as reinforced in the guidelines on human rights dialogues which were adopted by the Council last December; through our engagement with NGOs, including the extensive funding for human rights projects channelled through the European initiative for democratisation and human rights and mainstream programmes and through our cooperation with the UN and other organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors should be taken into account by those who point to the inevitable element of selectivity in the countries and themes which are the subject of EU initiatives at the UNCHR. They are not the sum total of the EU’s human rights policy necessarily, just an element of it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several issues which will feature throughout this year’s UN Commission. First, the highly regrettable failure by the US to secure re-election to the Commission and the participation of several states whose human rights records are – to put it very politely – less than acceptable. This means that the EU will have to work extra hard to ensure that core human rights values are reflected in the decisions taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the fight against terrorism, which has rightly permeated every corner of the political debate since 11 September. Human rights considerations are involved here at several levels. We must guard against any muddling of concepts. The EU maintains the important distinction that states are the perpetrators of human rights violations, whilst terrorists are particularly abhorrent criminals. And it is right that actions by states – whether at a legislative, judicial or penal level – are subject to international law and proper scrutiny. In fighting terrorism, we and our allies must uphold the values of respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The international community must also be alert to opportunistic attempts by states to justify domestic repression and crackdowns by claiming that they are "fighting terrorism". Zimbabwe is the most clear example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against racism will also be given due prominence at the 58th session of the UN Commission, and the EU may present a statement on the issue as in previous years. After a rather bumpy journey from Durban, we now have a solid declaration and programme of action – a welcome development which we must now put to good use. Combating racism, xenophobia and discrimination against minorities is one of the four priorities under the European initiative for democracy and human rights for the period 2002 to 2004. EUR 17 million per year have been set aside in order to support NGOs and other organisations in the promotion of rights and awareness-raising as a concrete follow-up to the World Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on two countries of particular interest, both to me and to this Parliament. First, China. This is the only country with which the EU has a dedicated human rights dialogue. The human rights situation in China rightly gives rise to a great deal of concern – from the extensive application of the death penalty to the suppression of religious and cultural rights in Tibet, Xinjiang and elsewhere and restrictions on the freedom of expression as evidenced in the recent measures on the use of the Internet. In this difficult context, the EU dialogue and seminars – the last of which, in December 2001 brought together European and Chinese experts to discuss the prevention of torture and the right to education – are one conduit for encouragement, cooperation and criticism. As the General Affairs Council has underscored, progress on the ground is a necessary corollary of the dialogue and that is why we evaluate the dialogue annually.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, in Iran, some progress in reform is offset by continuing serious human rights concerns. The UN Special Representative on Iran highlighted this at the Third Committee last year, referring in particular to the sharp increase in public hangings and floggings. The EU is engaging with Iran in an effort to secure improvement. The positive outcome for the EU resolution at the Third Committee shows that the international community shares our concerns. The acceptance of a visit by the Special Representative would be a further step in the right direction. The mandate for an EC trade and cooperation agreement is currently under discussion in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure honourable Members that human rights considerations will play an important part in any future negotiations.</p>

However, that does not detract from the fact that an increasing number of questions arise surrounding this annual high mass in Geneva. The human rights organisation summed the situation up as follows: it is the foxes that are having to watch over the chicken’s eggs. It is indeed suspicious that countries such as Kenya, Sudan, Togo and Congo, which do not have particularly good track records when it comes to respecting human rights, should chair this committee and help determine the standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the composition of the committee, the procedure – notably the system of majority voting – also raises questions. Governments that are the focus of investigation by NGOs often stick together in order to defend their own common interests, apparently under the motto: if we spare others, we do not run the risk of being condemned ourselves. That is why I support what Commissioner Nielson said a moment ago. Now that the US no longer forms part of this Committee, the European Union should take over the helm more than ever before. Europe must adopt a more assertive and consistent role when defending human rights. It must support more resolutions, also with regard to large countries, such as China and Russia. Some European Member States all too easily swallow their principles if economic interests are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Union must insist on the committee’s recommendations actually being followed up. A great deal of money is being spent on early warning, but the experts’ reports on this matter are systematically overlooked. The credibility of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva, and of human rights policy full stop, is at stake today, and I believe that, in this connection, the European Union bears a very heavy responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council said that we boast a long tradition in Europe on human rights, but it must be recognised that sometimes we hesitate in condemning the human rights abuses carried out by our so-called friendly states. I would urge that we must never hesitate; we must apply the same rules and standards regardless. Double standards undermine our highest ethics and our aspirations for a world free from human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree absolutely with everything the Commission has said. However, in relation to the Cotonou and Association Agreements, I would say that we must enact the human rights and democracy clauses when human rights abuses occur. Anything else will be seen as a pitiful endorsement of such abuses. We cannot, and must not, look the other way, for one day people will look the other way when it happens to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The young people and the others who look down on the Chamber today wonder what we talk about. We talk about a world where we can celebrate difference, where there is no persecution because someone's colour, creed, belief or sexuality is different from another's.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to finish, regardless of any prepared speech, on what is absolutely essential and vital to remember. Pastor Niemöller said: "When they came for the communists, I did not speak out because I was not a communist. When they came for the Jews, I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. When they came for me – there was no one left to speak out." We must ensure that we are never hypocritical in the defence of human rights, and 11 September must teach us surely that the same rules must be applied regardless of whether a country is our enemy or our friend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a responsibility, or moral duty, always to pay attention to human rights abuses wherever they occur. We therefore support the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva. It is an important forum for promoting these issues to the global arena.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more countries are signing fine declarations and international conventions, but these are often not complied with. Even though more and more countries are officially democracies, we know that – every second of every day, throughout the world – horrific treatment is meted out to human rights campaigners, campaigners for democracy and a variety of leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the focus is very much upon terrorism and the campaign against terrorism. You too have talked about this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. These matters are obviously important, but they are extremely closely linked to human rights. It is a human right <span class="italic">not to be affected </span>by terrorism. Terrorism is also born out of oppression and the lack of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. I hope that the meeting in Geneva will be characterised by discussion of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a broad agenda of issues that the EU must tackle in Geneva: violence against women, the situation of children, torture and the death penalty. Declarations are needed in these areas. A lot of countries give considerable cause for concern. Allow me to mention three areas. First of all, China, which holds the very dubious world record for the number of executions carried out there. Every day, there are reports of torture, the imprisonment of dissidents and the oppression of the people of Tibet, of the Falun Gong movement and of all those who are fighting for democracy. <span class="italic">Year after year</span>, we appeal for a resolution on China. Every year the same thing happens, namely that there is no such resolution. Let there be a resolution this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Zimbabwe. Every day, we can observe the vicious spiral of murder and persecution through which this country is sinking ever more deeply and completely into the abyss. We must show that our patience is at an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Tunisia. Somewhat away from the main headlines, extremely serious human rights abuses occur there too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While we are now once again steering our EU vessel into these waters we must avoid the sort of recklessness Odysseus showed when he sailed past the Pillars of Hercules out to the open sea. Although the EU has no coherent policy or strategy on human rights, with certain exceptions such as torture and the death penalty – in other words it lacks the assurance afforded by a compass and the firm guidance offered by nautical charts – we must steer our course at least with the help of bright stars and reference points.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States having failed to join the Commission last year, the EU is now the flagship of the Western European Group in Geneva. For that reason it is especially important that the Union should have an integrated policy based on clear geographical and thematic priorities, which does not grope about in the dark so much as it once did. President Cox last stressed the major significance of human rights in the EU and the work of this Parliament this morning. This should not be allowed to become just a rhetorical commitment. Undisturbed by commercial considerations and the songs of other such sirens, the EU must be able to allow its celebratory commitments to become a practical reality, and adopt an active position on difficult questions, such as China’s human rights violations with particular reference to the situation in Mongolia and in Tibet, or Russia’s behaviour, especially in Chechnya. In this connection neither can we allow the fight against terrorism in any way to jeopardise human rights and the principle of the Rule of Law, or tolerate their abuse as just an excuse for perhaps otherwise questionable intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are of course countries not mentioned here, and I would call for these not to be forgotten at this meeting. I would also especially call upon the Council not to forget Turkey, which still holds political prisoners in solitary confinement, when combating torture is discussed. I would urge that the prisoners in Camp X-Ray, who are being held there in defiance of the Geneva Convention, should not be forgotten. I would also urge that, when political and social rights are discussed, there should be no forgetting Turkey again, which is now in the process of banning the HADEP party because it is close to winning the minimum 10% of the votes it needs to be represented in the Turkish Parliament. I would also again call for the United States and China to be remembered when the death penalty is discussed and for its not to be overlooked that the United States has still not approved the International Criminal Court by ratifying the Statute of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say to the Commission that I very much approve of these agreements which we draw up in relation to third countries and which have human rights clauses attached. I just do not understand why observance of the agreements is not rather more strictly enforced, and I am thinking particularly in this context of Israel which has an agreement with the EU that is quite clearly not observed. I do not understand why such breaches have no repercussions and why the agreement is not cancelled immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we can be absolutely sure, that we can bet one hundred to one, that there will be no resolution on China, no resolution on Tibet, that there will be no support given to the European Union for resolutions on the situation of women in Saudi Arabia, that there will be no resolution or support from the Union for a resolution on Tunisia. There will not be anything – like last year, although it is true that, last year, the European Union even came to an arrangement so that it would not have the United States to deal with this year. I shall not even mention Chechnya. Commissioner Nielson is still trying to find Chechnya on the world map. Even within Parliament, Mr Oostlander and his accomplice, Mr Sakellariou – but this will not come a surprise to anyone – have even sabotaged an initiative to organise a meeting between two negotiators, one Chechen and one Russian. This is how the situation of human rights really stands. I do not think that we can turn a blind eye to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A lot has changed this year. The USA was not re-elected to membership of the Human Rights Convention and now has only observer status. The EU can no longer, then, hide behind the Americans. The misery of the Tibetans, the stifling of their religious and cultural life, the merciless persecutions and arrests that have gone on for decades are not forgotten. Because these people refrain from every kind of terrorism, they are not permanently on the front pages of newspapers, and yet they are very much present with us.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as one and a half years ago, Parliament called for the Tibetan government-in-exile to be recognised in the event of the UN-sponsored Sino-Tibetan negotiations not leading to Tibet's autonomy. An EU Special Envoy for Tibet was able to assume important coordination roles.</p>
<p class="contents">In his great October speech to this House, the Dalai Lama again expounded his concept of the middle way and urged Peking to take part in direct negotiations without preconditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, high time that the European Union itself got involved in Geneva, in order to bring in a resolution and win the support of responsible members of the Convention. The Chinese must not deceive themselves. We welcome their membership of the WTO and their contributions to the international coalition against terrorism. Nothing, though, can justify the brutal treatment they mete out to religious and ethnic minorities in Tibet as well as in Inner Mongolia and in Eastern Turkestan.

<p class="contents">We have known for quite a while now that suffering, poverty, human rights violations, persecution on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, religion, culture or race are global phenomena. Millions of human beings have to suffer these affronts every single day. 11 September reminded us that the breakdown of security is also a global phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">This latest conference in Geneva, the first since that fateful day, should not, therefore, cause us to lose sight of our aims. We have to continue working to defend citizens’ rights: the right to life, to democracy, to breathe clean air and to live in an environment in which economic and social rights are respected as an inseparable element of human rights. We must not forget that the balance between security and freedom is not only a demand that is coherent with our shared history, but that it is the only thing that can guarantee stability and, therefore, democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must play a leading role in this conference. We have to be capable of defending a common position. Now, more than ever before, human rights must effectively be the backbone of EU policy. If we want to achieve this goal we need to have more political ambition and a single, forceful and radical voice against those who violate human rights. A voice that will be heard in Geneva and which makes us proud to be European.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this seems to be a Utopian vision, and appears difficult to achieve, and it is, but, as Guy Verhofstadt reminded us when he took office as President-in-Office of the Council under the Belgian Presidency: ‘he who does not believe in Utopia does not deserve to be called European’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By then hand-wringing resolutions deploring human rights abuses by a re-elected Mugabe government would be no more meaningful than were the protests of the then League of Nations following Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has issued deadlines and ultimata. We must now gather support from the international community for those measures. We should thank President Mbeki and other African leaders for their work behind the scenes, but now is the time for them to speak out publicly and firmly against Mugabe's oppressive regime. We must make sure that the conditions of our ultimata are met in full. We must be sure that Mugabe will allow an EU team to observe the election process and the EU must be allowed to choose the make-up of that team, which should include British Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Our observers must be free to move where they wish and free to report back. A genuine free press must be restored and recent media laws must be repealed. Above all, the murder, maiming and intimidation of political opponents must stop now. It is time for the world to judge Mugabe by his actions, not by his promises. By the same token, the world will judge the EU by its effectiveness, not by its rhetoric. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am the first to recognise that the Human Rights Commission, being an international body in which compromises have to be made, is not exactly a forum in which the European Union can impose its principles and criteria; we have to reach agreement with others in order to pass effective resolutions, because we do not have a large enough majority to get approval for resolutions on all points, particularly on those we want approved. Although I recognise that many of the resolutions made by the Human Rights Commission leave much to be desired, I do not totally agree with Mr Dupuis’ chaotic and pessimistic view; I share, instead, the optimistic, positive, idealistic and utopian vision that Mrs Rosa Díez is encouraging the Council to pursue in the defence of these values, which are our own and which Parliament advocates on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues have been mentioned, all of them extremely problematic: China, Tunisia, Zimbabwe and Turkey. All of these issues are on the agenda. We deal with them every day and significant progress has, of course, been made over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the Human Rights Commission gets results every year, even though these may not be as far-reaching as our own ambitions and aspirations. However, there can be no doubt that the European Union should always be inspired by the desire to keep alive the flame of the fight for its basic principles and the defence of these, which I described in my opening speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council feels encouraged and supported by Parliament in knowing that this is the true home of the desire to uphold these principles which are inseparable from our project, the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to make one specific comment to Mr Stockton with regard to Zimbabwe. Naturally, what takes place in the Human Rights Commission is important for Zimbabwe, but I would like to remind you that the General Affairs Council took decisions last Monday, which we are going to implement in Zimbabwe, to declare, through our actions and not through our words or aspirations, our policy, which has Parliament’s full support and which has been decided unanimously by the Council of Ministers of the European Union, as regards not permitting or tolerating the anti-democratic behaviour of Mr Mugabe’s government. And, consequently, all of the measures agreed upon by the Council will be implemented jointly by the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure you, Mr President, that the Council is fully committed to the defence of the values and principles that are inherent to our culture, civilisation and to the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The European Union and all of its countries that have a place on the Human Rights Commission are the bastion, the vanguard of the defence of these rights. This is our interpretation. I would only ask Parliament to give us the necessary room for manoeuvre and confidence to defend these interests, which are our own, those of our culture and civilisation, and to do so as forcefully as possible, so that this can be made a reality in international society, which is, of course, very complex and which, unfortunately, the European Union cannot manage completely on its own. It goes without saying that our contribution and our determination will never falter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moving forward on the human rights agenda is basically no different from any other activity in international politics. This has to be understood. What can be done in a given situation in a given case is part of the broader political progress or lack of progress made at any given time. The reality is that we do not have a separate entity in international society in which we can discuss human rights only on their own merit. Politics never goes away. It is always part of this discussion, especially when we talk about it internationally. For that reason we have to equip ourselves with something one might call robust pragmatism in order to be strong enough to stay on course and pragmatic enough to know whether or not we can make headway in a given case.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Zimbabwe, I can inform Parliament that we are now positioning the first electoral observers. We already have people in Harare who are being groomed to act as electoral observers. We will thus have ten to fifteen people who will form the long-term team of observers. I am also pleased to inform Parliament that Mr Pierre Schori will head the observation team for Europe during the election in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not take it for granted that we will be able to carry out effective electoral observation. We are giving priority to positioning ourselves so that we can do this as well as possible and with as broad a representation as possible from Europe in our team as a whole. But the main priority is to actually do our work and not be marginalised by some tactical or political manoeuvre. Without this observation work the basis for us to give a final judgment will not be satisfactory. Nothing about Zimbabwe is easy. I am not in a position to express optimism or pessimism, but so far we are doing our utmost to ensure that we will be there with an effective team to observe the elections next month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
