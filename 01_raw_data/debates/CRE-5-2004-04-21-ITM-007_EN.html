<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  <span class="bold"></span> I now turn to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report on the freedom of expression, which I was invited to address earlier today. I shall point out a number of elements that have been drawn to my attention.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 338 amendments. I referred a request to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to consider the amendments under Rule 130a. I have received a report back from the committee. All the amendments tabled have received favourable votes from at least one-tenth of the members of the committee and so, under the Rules of Procedure, the amendments are entitled to stand.</p>
<p class="contents">I had received a letter from Mr Podestà requesting that the report be declared inadmissible. I replied to Mr Podestà and I sent a copy of our correspondence to the Civil Liberties Committee. I felt that, under the Rules, certain parts of the text could be reviewed, possibly involving the publication of a corrigendum; but that the report, as such, was admissible.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the debate yesterday, I received a request from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, to apply Rule 143 on the inadmissibility of the matter. The Vice-President in the Chair at the time ruled out this request because no notification had been given 24 hours in advance and because I, as President, had already decided that the report was admissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have since received a letter from Mr Poettering requesting a review of the decision not to refer the report back to committee. In his letter, Mr Poettering asks me once again to review the possibility of referral back, using the prerogatives and powers of the Presidency. In sticking to my decision, I am encouraged by the comments I have received from the chairman of the Civil Liberties Committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, who pointed out that the political groups shared my evaluation on the issue of admissibility in terms of the report overall. I thus intend to hold to the view that the report is indeed admissible in its totality, although some corrections may be required.</p>
<p class="contents">I am prepared to take a vote on the referral back before the start of the vote on the report. This is in accordance with the Rules, it is not a question of personal preference. The House can do this at any time and we need to respect that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">So, why are we not voting right now? Here we begin a rather sorry story. Yesterday the services received 51 pages of requests for roll-call, split and separate votes for the Boogerd-Quaak report on the freedom of expression and information. This would amount to a total of 1 200 single votes, in addition to the 338 amendments, resulting in a vote that could last for four hours or more.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, under these conditions, it was physically impossible for the services to prepare the vote overnight in time for voting today. At the end of the debate last night, the Vice-President in the Chair therefore announced that the report would be voted on Thursday. I have been looking into the matter – not just because it was raised today, but also because of its complexity – on the basis of the powers conferred on me, as President, by our Rules, especially the interpretation of Rule 19(1), which confers on the President 'the power to put texts to the vote in an order other than that set out in the document to be voted on', and also Rule 130 concerning the order of voting on amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fully recognise the rights of groups to table requests under our Rules. On this basis I wish to propose to you the following package. First, the vote would take place tomorrow at noon. Second, I shall allow a normal vote on all amendments, but no split votes and no roll-call votes on them. I shall also allow all requests for split votes concerning the original paragraphs of the motion for a resolution, but I shall allow only one roll-call vote per paragraph, according to indications supplied by Groups. This, I regret to inform you, would still give a total of 600 votes and a voting time that could last for two hours. It would, however, mean that this suggestion would rule out 1000 split votes on the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In making this proposal to you I am trying to strike a balance between the rights of different Groups in the House and the preferences of one or another to try to conduct our business in a reasonably orderly fashion. I am prepared to put my proposal to you in accordance with Rule 19. If the House rejects the proposal I shall decide on the basis of Rule 130(3) to put to the vote first the original text of the report, paragraph by paragraph, and to vote on that alone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my proposal. I am prepared to hear one speaker from each Group, to vote and then make a ruling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I must say firstly that it was I who proposed the content of that report, which was supported by a majority in the Conference of Presidents, and it deals with freedom of expression and information in the European Union – particularly in Italy, but in the European Union as a whole – and Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s excellent report refers to the majority of countries in the European Union, including my own, and I therefore believe that it is a good piece of work which does credit to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like firstly to make a political criticism, because I believe it is very positive that during this last plenary session of this legislature we should hold an in-depth political debate, and this relates to the case of filibustering which has arisen in relation to this report. You have mentioned a series of incidents which have taken place during the negotiation of the report. I can add some more information: for example, documents have disappeared in the committee, something which is entirely inexplicable. We are facing an obstacle course. And since you yourself have mentioned a letter which was written to you by Vice-President Podestà, I am aware of an article Mr Podestà has written today in the well-known Italian newspaper <span class="italic">Corriere della Sera</span>, in which he makes a series of serious accusations with regard to the European Parliament’s behaviour. He says – and I quote in Italian: <span class="italic">il Regolamento del Parlamento Europeo è stato aggirato, consentendo di dare un corso inarrestabile alla discussione in aula</span>, [the Rules of Procedure have been flouted, by allowing the debate in Parliament to run on indefinitely] and further on it says that <span class="italic">nella commissione per le Libertà Pubbliche, di maggioranza di centrosinistra ... </span>[in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is dominated by the centre-left …] Well, I did not know that we were so dominant in Parliament and I do not know if Mr Poettering will agree with this.</p>
<p class="contents">He then refers to the letter which he wrote to you and says that President Cox, in his reply, <span class="italic">ha dovuto ammettere che sostanzialmente avevo diverse ragioni </span>[had to admit that I was to a large extent right].</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make it clear that I believe that we in the so-called centre-left coalition have strictly observed the Rules of Procedure; we have had the patience of Job in the face of systematic manoeuvring involving blocking and filibustering. However, if we look at the issue in political terms, I accept that there are two groups in the House – and I am coming to an end, Mr President – who indulge in filibustering, because it is they who have tabled all the amendments but four, and I understand why they would defend Mr Berlusconi, who is currently the leader of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I accept that as well, but they should say so clearly, because ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... because I would remind you of an old Roman Law principle which said – and this was what made Rome great – that one cannot legislate for the benefit of just one person. We must legislate for all the citizens, and that is what is at stake here. And I will therefore end, Mr President ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... I will end with a proposal, Mr President: the so-called centre-left coalition has four amendments. You have 350. We accept that they be voted on en bloc and, if not, we accept that the President’s proposal should be voted on paragraph by paragraph.</p>

You asked a question and Mr Barón Crespo provided an explanation, but he failed to arrive at any conclusion. That is why I have risen in order to say that I will gladly endorse your proposal to hold the vote tomorrow. We are in a difficult situation with 338 amendments which are multiplying as a result of procedural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, to underline this point, and I make it calmly and objectively. We have already discussed this issue this morning when the sitting opened at 9 a.m. The Chairman of one of the groups claimed that the amendments come from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I would like to point out that there are 338 amendments, and that not all of these amendments come from our group. We have tabled 157, which means that 181 amendments come from other people. I would ask for this fact to be noted.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refrain from commenting on the quality of the report at this point as I do not wish to exacerbate the situation, but I would ask everyone to work together to achieve some kind of resolution to this difficult issue. Mr President, we know you to be a fair and objective President of this House, and if you propose that we vote on the report tomorrow at 12 noon in accordance with the procedure that you suggest, you have our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, I feel we could accept Mrs Frassoni’s invitation to re-examine some amendments to see whether it is possible to group them together or cut any out. I am certainly in favour of having the vote tomorrow, if that is more convenient for everybody, but, Mr President, I am absolutely against any possibility of having all the amendments and all the calls for secret ballots rescinded, because it is unthinkable that all the secret ballots could simply be wiped out like that. I recall that many Members from other groups have tabled 30 or 40 proposals for secret ballots on documents that interest them without causing any outcry at all in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with what certain Members have said, I remind Mr Barón Crespo – who criticised an article by Mr Podestà – that this mysterious, as he puts it, centre-left coalition has already published a pamphlet taking the approval of this report in this House as a certainty and making a whole series of remarks, even though the report has not yet even been put to the vote. Publishing wicked comments or lies is certainly not a mark of goodwill in a political group.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other Member who spoke of ‘Mr Berlusconi’s friends’, I can assure him on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that our amendments are on behalf of the whole group; the whole group is united; none of us has private friendships or enmities; but we claim the right as Members of this Parliament to carry out our mandate to the full, doing what the Rules of Procedure allow and not just standing by listening to the constant provocations made even in committee.</p>

I ask everybody to maintain a respectful attitude towards this House. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I have always respected the positions of others: I therefore ask you to respect them in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Barón Crespo, first of all I had already asked to speak before now, my dear sir, but I was not given the floor. I have to say that I fully endorse what I wrote, because in effect, in fact, one only needs to take a precise look at the numbers to see what the situation is. Then, with regard to Mr Cox’s letter in reply, I have also had to write back to him indicating the points in his letter where he recognised that there were serious shortcomings and defects in the report itself. I therefore respect the President’s decision but, I beg you, do not hide behind a problem that does not exist and which, in any case, is not yours, just because you do not want to respond to a specific request by Mr Hernández Mollar.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point, Mr President: once again I accept the vote of this House, the vote that you, Mr President, have had taken here today. If, however, we read the Rules of Procedure, it is not up to the House to decide when or how a particular vote should be taken: it is your direct responsibility. As far as I am concerned, then, you asked for advice and then decided independently. It is not the House that can decide on such matters. You should all, please, read the Rules of Procedure and study them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo, the Rules of Procedure are not something from which you can pick and choose; therefore let the person who has the floor and is democratically elected and represents here the citizens of this …</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think there is always someone amongst us who has discovered democracy too late and who perhaps, therefore, is not familiar either with its rules or with its deeper meaning.</p>

That is what is giving rise to this fair, legitimate and inevitable reaction to the abuse on the part of the majority of this House, who invoke the Treaties in order to breach them and the Charter of Fundamental Rights similarly to contravene some of its rules.

The majority would decide that. Failing a referral back, we will vote in the manner indicated earlier. Mr Podestà was correct when he said that it is my choice, but that choice is now informed by your wisdom.</p>
