<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, air pollution continues to be a serious problem in Europe. An oral question tabled for this part-session, which I replied to before the dinner break, illustrates the point by quoting from the World Health Organization study on the number of cases of premature deaths or serious illness caused by air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we have made considerable progress in reducing concentrations of some pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide or lead, other pollutants continue to pose a threat. That is why the Commission is continuing to pursue a vigorous policy against air pollution. We have under way a large programme called Clean Air for Europe to prepare for the thematic strategy on air pollution due to be adopted next year. This programme focuses especially on some of the most widespread problems, such as particulate matter and ground-level ozone.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also looking at other types of pollution, which also have important consequences for human health. Among these are the pollutants which are the subject of the proposed directive being discussed today, the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium and nickel, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and mercury. They are, in fact, the last in the list of pollutants mentioned in the Air Quality Framework Directive of 1996 as requiring specific action. Three daughter directives have been adopted so far, pursuant to that directive, covering all the other pollutants on the list. The directive being discussed today thus forms the last in a series of legislation provided for under the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">An important aspect of the proposed directive concerns monitoring. Currently, we do not have enough information on how widespread these pollutants are and we urgently need more data. For the heavy metals we have decided not to propose any limits or target value, since the main problems occur in the immediate vicinity of certain industrial installations, and levels that can be easily achieved elsewhere would not be achievable in these areas without taking disproportionate measures, even leading to shutting down the installations.</p>
<p class="contents">But that does not mean that nothing can, or will, be done to reduce the levels of pollution. These installations are covered by the IPPC Directive and best available techniques will therefore have to be applied to reduce emissions by 2007. By ensuring adequate monitoring of concentrations near these sources and making results available to the public, this directive will help to ensure that the operators of these installations take the necessary measures to keep emissions as low as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">For polyaromatic hydrocarbons the problem is not limited to such a small number of sources, so we have proposed a target value obliging Member States to take all necessary measures to reach the required level, as long as they do not entail excessive costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that there is a wish to go further than we have in setting binding limit values for some of these pollutants and I fully sympathise with the desire to protect human health that this reflects. At the same time, it seems highly doubtful that there would be any real advantage in setting binding limit values that will simply be unachievable and would therefore need to be the subject of derogations or exemptions in the very places where the main problem occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view I welcome the decision to postpone the vote on this subject to allow for alternative possibilities to be explored. In any case, by ensuring a high level of monitoring in the worst affected areas and setting a target value for polyaromatic hydrocarbons where the sources are more widespread, the directive as proposed will make an important contribution to reducing this type of pollution, raising public awareness and making Europe's air safer to breathe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kronberger (NI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE) </span>Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are dealing with here is the fourth daughter directive to the Air Quality Framework Directive, which already has three adopted daughters, the first on sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and lead, the second on benzene and carbon monoxide and the third on ozone. In the first two cases, limit values were sought and were duly enshrined in the directives. The so-called mother directive, in other words the overarching framework legislation, also calls for limit values in respect of arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This is the basic requirement. In the case of ozone, the framework directive only provides for a target value, and the third daughter directive set the target accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present discussion on this fourth daughter directive, there are three positions: the Commission has adopted the position that monitoring is enough and sets a proposed target value for benzopyrenes. This, in my view, is contrary to the framework directive, and I know of earlier Commission drafts in which limit values were set. The Commission, then, has already deliberated on this point. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted by a very narrow majority of 26 to 24 for limit values. These limits did not come from me, because I was pretty poor at chemistry in my schooldays, but from experts from the Commission, international experts and a committee of people with a sound scientific grounding. In short, these limit values are feasible from the Commission’s point of view, which, in this case, we have endorsed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very many indications from industry too that these target and limit values can be achieved. We also voted in the Committee on the Environment for the omission of the original requirement for a time limit for industrial areas where these values are difficult to achieve. In other words, we were very responsive to the needs of industry, telling them that, where damage had been done to their environment in the past, where there was a history of pollution, they were not actually expected to achieve the targets within a very short period. In addition, the Committee on the Environment commissioned a study from the Institute for European Environmental Policy. The study likewise confirms the feasibility of limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">The third position is that of the Council, with which we have already conducted preliminary negotiations and maintained contacts and dialogue. In the view of the Council, or a potential majority of the Council, target values are also conceivable. This point will undoubtedly be the focus of future discussions too.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly must be clearly aware of the significance of these heavy metals. They are genotoxic human carcinogens, which, even in minimal doses, effect a change in DNA – in people’s genetic make-up. There is definitely a need to appreciate fully what is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">The line of argument adopted in the Commission document, namely that it is all a matter of cost-benefit analysis, of weighing the cost of filters or technical measures against potential savings from a reduction in the number of people dying from cancer, is, to my mind, extremely cynical. The second step, namely an assessment of the secondary benefits in terms of a lower incidence of disease, has not been taken at all, because such benefits are difficult to quantify. Such a cynical line of argument will not wash with the bulk of the European population.</p>
<p class="contents">We have postponed tomorrow’s vote with the intention of trying to reach an agreement with the Council before the end of the present legislative term. I am pleased that the Commissioner shares my view that we can perhaps use these remaining weeks to reach a compromise that will ultimately enable us to look one another straight in the eye. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this instance, the rapporteur Mr Kronberger with, as he admits, slim support by two votes from the members of the committee, is proposing to change non-mandatory target values to mandatory limit values for arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzopyrene.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy informally sought – and this was the first time it was carried out – a cost-benefit analysis. There is no mechanism yet within Parliament for this. The trouble is that it is inevitably incomplete, given the time pressures within which we had to operate. It concludes, and Mr Kronberger has drawn comfort from this, that some of the proposed limit values are achievable – 'feasible' in his words. That is a technical assessment. When the study comes to look at the costs of reaching the target, as the Commissioner said, things are not so rosy. In the study drawn up for Parliament, the precise costs of reaching the limit values that Mr Kronberger wants are not analysed in any systematic way. The study itself says that, for arsenic, some plants might be able to comply but some could not and that 'a more detailed analysis of the reasons why compliance by the other plants will be impossible seems to be justified'. The rapporteur, faced with the impossible, prefers to ignore this stark verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the application of limit values to cadmium, the study again draws attention to the lack of detailed information on the impact of what Mr Kronberger proposes. In the case of limit values for nickel, the study notes that applying limit values on the Kronberger lines would require investments beyond best available techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Kronberger now has to demonstrate is how far what the Commission proposes constitutes a proven danger to human health, how this danger is inadequately dealt with through the provisions of the IPPC Directive and why therefore it is worth pursuing his idea for mandatory limit values irrespective of the cost. In my view, he has completely failed to demonstrate that and all we have is the bald observation in his explanatory statement that 'no limit value can be set below which these substances constitute no risk to human health'. There is no way in which he is capable of going in the direction of what the Commission is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament is unwise enough, in a first reading compromise or in a second reading – which might be a long way ahead – to endorse what Mr Kronberger wants, then it will only have itself to blame if the Council, or perhaps the Commission, carries out the real, extensive cost-benefit analysis that Mr Kronberger does not have. Arriving at a point where cost-benefit analyses are on our agenda is not a sign of obstructionism, it is a sign that Parliament is at long last moving from seeing itself as a pressure group for the environment and evolving into a responsible part of the legislative process. But with the Kronberger report as it is, we clearly have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kronberger and the Commissioner have mentioned the possibility of a first reading agreement. I cannot see how on earth there can be a first reading agreement between Mr Kronberger's approach and that which, I imagine, the Council has endorsed. I would like to think we could have a first reading agreement, but somebody has got to move and I hope it is Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it goes without saying that the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also a negotiating position, as my honourable colleague Mrs Jackson knows from her own political experience. We want a clearer definition of the aim we are trying to pursue, and rightly so. To that extent, Commissioner, however much I normally value your work, I am not entirely happy with the proposal, because it essentially offers nothing more than a system which will result in new sets of measurements – and let me say in passing to Mrs Jackson, who normally attaches great importance to the cost factor, that these measurements will be expensive, creating costs for the local authorities, regions or national governments that have to fund these measuring stations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are aware of the dangerous nature of these heavy metals. In this respect, merely saying that we intend to take measurements is not the right approach, nor is it the most cost-effective. We must clearly indicate the direction in which we intend to proceed. As I said, the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is, quite evidently, a negotiating position too. When we negotiate with the Council, positions will naturally shift. That is perfectly obvious, and for this reason I advocated postponement of the vote, precisely to have this time for negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim, though, is to make it clear what direction we intend to take in this area of our policy on air quality. I am not such a dogmatist that I would absolutely insist on enshrining particular target values and regarding them as non-negotiable, but we must make clear statements about the ultimate aim if we are to prevent the emission of hazardous substances into the environment, into the air we breathe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the ways in which most of these hazardous substances, such as cadmium, chromium or nickel, enter the atmosphere, we find that they are generally emitted in areas with high population densities. This is why I have received letters from many local authorities asking us to set binding limit values so that they can deal better with their situation on the ground. But I do not see that as a solution. We must take full advantage of all the possibilities offered by technological progress to reduce emissions. For this reason, we need target values, coupled with clear statements as to how and when they can be achieved. In this respect I am confident, Mrs Jackson, that we can reach an agreement in our negotiations with the Council at the first reading, an agreement which clearly conveys the message that we wish to avoid emissions of these heavy metals altogether wherever possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These substances do not belong in the ambient air. In my opinion, the impact studies do not contribute a great deal in this respect. These studies cost a lot of money and leave us politicians with as much uncertainty. I take the view that we should make every effort to remove those harmful substances from our ambient air as much as possible. The Commission has opted only to monitor pollution. This is, I think, too restricted, and I fundamentally object to this approach. The quality of ambient air is not improved merely by mapping out pollution. As the other daughter directives <span class="italic">do</span> include binding limit values, I fail to understand why this was not done in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I also realise, though, that we must have our feet firmly on the ground; it may be that the limit values from the previous daughter directives were too strict. However, this does not mean that we should decide now on non-binding target values. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I backed the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Kronberger. He is currently negotiating with the Council about an agreement at first reading. This is a noble pursuit, in my view. Since the outcome of these negotiations is not yet known, it is impossible for me to take a stand in this. I would, however, like to say to Mr Kronberger that we should obviously not prescribe any binding limit values that fall below background concentration levels.</p>
<p class="contents">I am expressly pleading in favour of realistic limit values. It is, for example, known that emissions are, to a large extent, caused by diffuse sources, for example by the heating of houses and transport, which it is extremely difficult to deal with. Results can, however, be achieved in various sectors in industry; the metal industry springs to mind, as do power plants, waste incineration plants and the waste recycling sector. In the case of waste incineration, a considerable amount of heavy metals are released. The exact amount is unknown because the obligations for measuring emissions are very basic. Binding limit values should therefore also be introduced for the benefit of various sectors in industry, as well as the obligation to measure emission levels. I hope that we can reach agreement with the Council on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The framework directive lists the air pollutants for which limit values, target values and, where necessary, alert thresholds must be laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy accepted 60 amendments to the Commission’s proposal and in this way it, as well as other issues, were brought more in line with the three earlier directives on the quality of ambient air.</p>
<p class="contents">This integrated package on the quality of ambient air now being finalised will be an effective way of preventing air pollution in the EU, except in one important area: small particles. At the present time it is difficult to measure the tiniest particles of all and for that reason it is in practice impossible. It is the human body, however, that is most defenceless against these smallest particles. Whilst larger particles get trapped at different points in our respiratory organs, the smaller ones get straight into our lungs, and there they remain. The risk to health is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s technical working groups are, in my opinion, the right place to assess the risk of particles and the possibility of measuring them. The experts in different areas in these working groups should formulate opinions on individual pollutants, based on current knowledge, and so present data that proposals for directives can be based on. As the package of four directives on ambient air quality is now being finalised, the working groups should be given the task of dealing with the problems relating to small particles with the aim of establishing common methods and assessment criteria in the Member States. This would be an essential addition to the list of Community objectives to improve air quality and promote public health in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should perhaps be more moderate in my views tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">He may be quite passionate in his opinions but frankly they are misjudged. He might be quite earnest in the conclusions he arrives at but frankly they are erroneous. He must now face the reality that if he wants to regulate emissions of this kind from the industrial installations we are talking about, setting emission values just does not work. The impact on those installations of trying to impose such standards would be unbearable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have one or two kind things to say about his report. Like the curate's egg in English parlance, it is good in parts. If you look at mercury and arsenic, for example, there may be a case for trying to set emission values in this sector, but certainly not in others. Take for example nickel. Nickel is one of the most important elements used in the production of stainless steel. The most common type of stainless steel contains 18% of nickel, but it can contain up to 30%. The nonsense of this proposal is that it assumes the measures used to control gaseous emissions of nickel can be applied to the situation in steel plants where nickel is emitted as a fine dust during the production process. In reality, the vast amounts of dust in the production area contain only a very small amount of nickel and the emissions from steel plants are relatively small. To try nevertheless to reach emission values in such a situation would be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Again in the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the kind of measure proposed by Mr Kronberger will inevitably lead to the closure or end of use of coal-fired power stations, to the end of coal burning being used, to a loss of jobs and, across the whole of Europe, to an even greater reliance on imported gas and other supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">However well-meaning, these proposals are unrealistic, ill-considered and would undermine Europe's reputation for taking a responsible approach. I would urge him to think again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Limit values are needed, for example for arsenic. This is a real problem in my country. The town of Coevorden near the German border has made the decision to incinerate virtually all the old railway sleepers in Europe, thus releasing the arsenic from them into the ambient air. That is completely wrong and that is why we need strict limit values. If these cannot be put in place straight away because the political majority is not in favour, that is extremely regrettable, but these heavy metals are carcinogenic and their use has to be curbed. If that is to be done via target values as a short-term measure, then that receives my reluctant agreement. However, in the longer term, limit values definitely have to be introduced on the basis of one extra cancer case in one million cases. We adopted exactly the same guiding principle for the drinking water directive, which was accepted by the Commission, the body that had proposed the principle, the Council and Parliament. Why do we not do the same in the case of arsenic, cadmium, mercury and nickel? That would be the way forward towards a possible compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one, as has already been said here many times, that concerns carcinogenic heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), quite small amounts of many of which damage the genotype of cells. The objective is to prevent and reduce the harmful effects of air pollutants on human health and the environment. It has also already been said here that this directive differs from the earlier daughter directives in that this one does not propose binding limit values. This has been justified by the fact that it is not possible in the short term to find cost-effective measures.</p>
<p class="contents">One might also argue that, if limit values were set, they would then lead to cost-effective measures having to be found. We have many examples of situations where technical solutions have also been found once clear targets have been set and there is enough incentive to meet them. Monitoring and measuring together are an important element in this directive, and greater attention will have to be paid to the comparability of measuring techniques and results both nationally and at Community level. Effective monitoring will mean it will be possible to set new binding limit values as new technical applications are established. The measurements must, however, be carried out cost-effectively, taking different circumstances into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I do not believe that the proposed amendments would have the desired effect. In reality, limit values would have to be accompanied either by exemptions for certain areas or by provisions allowing Member States to apply for derogations in cases where the limit values cannot be met. The proposed amendments envisaged the latter solution, but either way we can be sure that derogations will be granted in precisely the areas where the problems occur. It is difficult to see how this would result in public health being better protected. Similarly, there is little point in setting long-term objectives without having a clear idea of how such objectives can be met. For these reasons, the Commission cannot, at this stage, accept any of the amendments that seek to introduce binding limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission could accept the reintroduction of the concept of upper and lower assessment thresholds foreseen in the framework directive, which is the subject of six of the amendments tabled. Although this concept is usually linked with the limit values, the concept has some advantages, even in the absence of limit values, since it provides a flexible regime where the degree of monitoring requirements depends on the level of observed concentrations.</p>
