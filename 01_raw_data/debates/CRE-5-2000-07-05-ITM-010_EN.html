The Community Eco-management and Audit Scheme is not exactly the most popular of the environmental issues but, nevertheless, it is a fantastic instrument for making progress in the field of integrating economic activities and the preservation of the environment. By adopting a system of environmental management, companies – whether they be industrial or service companies – learn to integrate environmental considerations into the normal management of the company, discovering the many and significant advantages, not only environmental but also economic, which this offers them, amongst other things, because they improve their competitive position. It therefore seems to me very significant that this regulation is currently being reviewed and that new elements are being incorporated into it which are extremely useful for the environmental improvement of processes, services and products.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of more incentives for European companies to have access to the system, the participation of interested parties – especially workers –, the strengthening of reliability vis-à-vis third parties and an increase in the transparency of information are the main objectives of the amendments which I took up on first reading in Parliament and which were approved unanimously in the Environment Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the committee also approved certain amendments which were contrary to the opinion of the rapporteur, and I have continued to disagree with them. In this respect, I wish to refer to Amendments Nos 5, 6, 10 and 17, on the controversial issue of the use of the best available technology, as an instrument for environmental improvement, being obligatory for countries which wish to be included in the EMAS register. Let us remember that EMAS is a voluntary market instrument. Let us remember also that one of the main objectives of the current revision of the regulations is to make the system more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses and also the service sector. Let us add that until now the initiative has been relatively successful when compared to the other alternative formula, the ISO 14.001 standard, which is more flexible in many ways than EMAS. Let us bear in mind that the best available technology, as defined by the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, is only applicable to large industrial plants and not to the service sector or to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, I believe that you will agree with me when I say that, although I am absolutely in favour of development and progress with regard to the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), this is not the time, and EMAS is not the right instrument, to demand that companies who want to join the scheme adopt the best available technologies. In fact, the large plants, as stipulated in the IPPC Directive, will continue to be obliged to be included in the EMAS register, since they will have to abide by the environmental legislation in force – Amendment No 12 – which obviously includes compliance with the IPPC Directive in the cases where companies are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to insist on Amendments Nos 41 and 50, which my Group would be prepared to accept as long as it is made clear that the word ‘representatives’ refers to people chosen as such within each company and in no event to organisations, whose participation would hinder and delay the process of adopting the system. I hope that tomorrow other groups will offer oral amendments in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other amendments which I would like to comment on: Amendment No 19, for which I have requested a separate vote up to the paragraph which reads “public structures and public contracts”, up to this point leaving the Commission’s text intact. I believe that the Commission is preparing – and in this sense I would be grateful for a comment from Mrs Wallström – a proposal on the inclusion of the environmental principle as a necessary consideration when awarding public contracts, and I therefore think it appropriate to await the approval of that proposal. With regard to Amendment No 22, on the incorporation of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, within a period of four years, into the EMAS system, I have consulted the Commission in writing and I would like the Commissioner to reply to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Amendment No 25 refers to the harmonisation of EMAS with the ISO standard, which is very important to the dissemination of each instrument, and we are very happy with the harmonisation agreement relating to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Germany and Austria a great number of businesses have taken part in it, whereas the uptake from businesses in other Member States has been very low. The aim of the present revision must therefore be to make the eco-audit scheme more attractive. For that reason it is important that there should be scope to involve companies from the service sector and to support small and medium-sized enterprises. All that, however, is not enough, in my view. More needs to be done, particularly in terms of reducing the administrative burden and establishing ways of projecting the public profile of the service. </p>
<p class="contents">From discussions at various company headquarters it has emerged that EMAS has an internal impact and that workforces are playing a far greater part in protecting the environment, but the time has now come to improve the external impact of the system. In all the reflections on how to improve EMAS, one thing has to be remembered, namely that EMAS is a voluntary system which companies can join. It must not therefore be encumbered with concepts such as best available technology. These are binding specifications which set excessively difficult targets. All we shall achieve by adopting them is to make businesses quit the system. That surely serves no purpose at all. The system has proved useful so far, and we should build on the valuable experience that has been amassed. If we cherish certain environmental ideals, I am certainly willing to pursue them too, but that will take us down the road of directives and regulations. We cannot realise such ideals by opting for a voluntary system like EMAS.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point that seems important to me if the eco-audit is to be a practicable mechanism is the frequency of its validation. The proposal envisages renewal of the validation at yearly intervals. That, to my mind, is far too frequent. Companies have to spend nine months on the preparation of an environmental report. They cannot do that if annual validation is required. I therefore propose an interval of two to three years, and I hope you will support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do believe, however, that the examples of Austria and Germany to which the previous speaker, Mr Schnellhardt, has already referred, show that it is no coincidence that the countries where participation levels are highest are among the proponents of the tabled position, in which adherence to the existing environmental provisions and the use of the best available technology are seen as key instruments for improving companies' efficiency in the use of natural resources and their protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I should like to give my wholehearted support to those amendments that call for the use of the best available technology as well as to canvass your support for Amendment No 12, which lays special emphasis on compliance with existing environmental provisions. I am well aware, of course, that there must be incentives to encourage wider participation in this scheme. For all that, I believe that the credibility of this eco-audit scheme can only be guaranteed if we set our own high standards rather than pursuing the opposite strategy of alignment with the ISO standard. </p>
<p class="contents">My Group also attaches particular importance to the participation of employees and their representatives. I accept the rapporteur's proposal – we came to an agreement on this today – that an oral amendment be moved tomorrow in order to make it clear that we also accept the compromise on the involvement of employees and their representatives, in other words the reduction of such involvement to the works level. In my view, this will represent a major step forward in the implementation of EMAS, not only in terms of its democratic credentials but also from a managerial point of view.</p>

Seven years after its creation, however, EMAS is a success only in some countries. There is still a long way to go, and today we need to identify the reason for this limited result.</p>
<p class="contents">EMAS is complex, too complex. The regulation imposes heavy constraints on those companies which do agree, voluntarily, to participate. This complexity is such as to discourage SMEs, which, as we all know, are bending under the weight of bureaucracy. Yet they are the engine of Europe’s economy. We should be making them our number one priority, hence the importance of the incentives our rapporteur was just talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, I would also say that some amendments are in danger of erring through excess of ambition. I mean Amendments Nos 5, 10 and 17 on the best available technologies, the BATs. A requirement like that would mean sometimes insoluble problems for SMEs, which cannot always adapt to these BATs. In any case their very definition is already a problem for some economic sectors. </p>
<p class="contents">So the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be voting against. On the other hand, in the spirit of compromise, we are ready to support Amendments Nos 43, 44 and 45, which link these best available technologies, from the environmental viewpoint, with conditions that are economically and technically viable for businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of workers’ participation, which we naturally value highly and which the common position entirely authorises. On the other hand, we reject Amendments Nos 41 and 50, because more restrictive measures here again threaten to discourage a large number of candidate firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will simply say that quantity must not drive out quality. The system is voluntary, so it must be attractive in order to survive. Otherwise EMAS will be no more than a litany of good intentions likely to be impracticable for businesses and therefore completely useless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot understand the reluctance to accept this. It really is an essential instrument. If we are genuine about wanting to encourage firms to improve environmental policy and environmental performance, then it is necessary that the best available technology should be encouraged. It makes no sense to me whatsoever to be reluctant to promote that. If the best available technology is there, then the firm should be encouraged to use it. We are never going to make any advances otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a voluntary scheme, but if firms genuinely want to improve their environmental policy and their environmental performance then any encouragement in that direction should be welcomed. So far as the arguments against the best available technology are concerned, they do not stand up to scrutiny. It is essential that this element, and the amendments in relation to best available technology, be supported by Parliament. I would urge the Commission, too, to take this on board. If we are serious about trying to encourage firms in the right direction then we have to encourage the best available technology.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that extent, it is only right and fitting that we should try to guarantee the manageability of the system, which is why we have taken pains to reach the present agreement between the two major groups, Mrs Scheele, so that the validation is not limited to one year but can be organised in a pragmatic manner, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. It goes without saying that they cannot be expected to do a validation every year – that would be absurd. We must find an effective and manageable solution to that problem. But I also believe that we need a rational approach to the question of the best available technology, because it is surely unacceptable that two companies producing at entirely different levels – one to a low technological standard and the other to a high standard – should both be able to operate the eco-management and audit system and should both be certificated. That is patently absurd and will ultimately mislead those who are liable to buy products advertised as EMAS-compliant. For that reason we need to set a standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the amendments we adopted in the Environment Committee go too far. For that reason I am pleased that Amendments 43, 44 and 45 have been proposed as a means of covering the available forms of technology in a similar way to another directive and of limiting the initial scope of the regulation to industrial activity, since it is undoubtedly far harder to legislate for the service sector in this domain. Accordingly, I would suggest that if we can reach agreement on the frequency of validation, we ought perhaps to be able to reach agreement on this aspect as well. So the first thing to do is to establish the verification procedure; the application of that procedure will perhaps reveal various ways in which the system can be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be made clear that EMAS accreditation is intended as a reward for those companies which are the real engines of ecological progress. BAT – the best available technology – is the fundamental prerequisite of EMAS, because it would be downright absurd for a company to be regarded as an environmental trailblazer if it did not use the best available technology, and it is surely plain to see that anything else boils down to ISO 14000, in other words to our simply selling EMAS down the river, because it would then be ISO in another guise. In that case we could forget the directive altogether, because it would correspond to ISO. For that reason I fail to understand the misgivings that have been voiced, particularly with regard to small and medium-sized businesses, because it is precisely those firms which have the least onerous obligations in this respect. Conversely, we have seen time and again that many small and medium-sized enterprises are far more innovative than their larger counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">EMAS is an important voluntary instrument for companies, but paramount importance attaches to its coordination with environmental programmes. Studies in Germany have shown that, unfortunately, EMAS organisations have not yet recognised protection of the climate, for example, as a major goal. From that point of view I believe that we should not sell ourselves short here by putting EMAS on a par with ISO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, for her work on the Commission’s proposal concerning EMAS.</p>
<p class="contents">Before discussing the individual amendments, I want to touch upon three key issues, namely best available technology, the frequency with which the environmental statement is to be validated and the link between participation in EMAS and compliance with the requirements of compulsory environmental legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">The changes proposed by the European Parliament where best available technology is concerned should mean that all organisations which participate in EMAS should be forced to apply best available technology. The Commission agrees with the principle that all organisations registered to EMAS ought to try to apply best practice within their areas of activity and work as effectively as possible on issues of technology, materials and organisation. The concept of best available technology, which is expressly defined in the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution, is nonetheless only relevant to industry. This has also been noted by the European Parliament in some of its amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that EMAS is now being opened to all economic sectors, the requirement that best available technology must be used is likely to mean in practice that many sectors will be prevented from participating in EMAS. For example, the European Parliament itself would not be able to participate because best available technology is not a concept which can be applied to public institutions. A requirement of this kind would also be a major obstacle for small and medium-sized companies, which are not covered by the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution. If the attempt were made to circumvent this derogation by means of EMAS, which is a voluntary system, this would probably mean that small and medium-sized companies would refrain from participating in EMAS.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to those amendments in which best available technology is confined to the area of application of the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution, it ought to be pointed out that it is not EMAS’s task to be an alternative way of ensuring that compulsory legislation is applied. </p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that it is important for organisations to comply with that environmental legislation which affects them. It might be said that it is a minimum requirement that environmental legislation should be respected. The purpose of EMAS is to help organisations to perform better and to exceed that minimum. The objective is not, however, to provide supervisory authorities with absolute proofs that an organisation which is EMAS-registered is complying with all current legislation in all situations. In view of EMAS’s systematic structure, organisations will clearly be well placed to comply with the environmental legislation. EMAS is, however, a voluntary system. If the European Parliament maintains its amendments, the basis of which is that compliance with environmental legislation must be guaranteed, EMAS’s role will be in danger of changing. EMAS will instead become a replacement for environmental verifications carried out by the Member States’ competent authorities. I am convinced that that is not the European Parliament’s intention. </p>
<p class="contents">How frequently is the environmental statement to be validated? The environmental statement is, of course, the visible public result of EMAS being implemented within an organisation. That report must therefore correspond to the expectations of those in the surrounding area. One such expectation is that the environmental statement should be reliable. The simplest way of building up confidence in the conclusions of the statement is to carry out regular, impartial verifications. An annual verification of the statement would therefore be more appropriate than a verification every third year, as in the majority of cases. I would emphasise that the common position is flexible in this respect. Account can, therefore, already be taken of special cases or special problems. I am therefore afraid that, by dispensing with the principle of annual reporting in its amendments, the European Parliament may damage EMAS’s credibility, which is a prerequisite if the new EMAS is to be successful. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to turn now to the individual amendments. The Commission has carefully examined the 50 amendments which have been tabled and is able to approve 11 of these. How credible EMAS is and how attractive it is to companies are two crucial considerations if EMAS is to function. The Commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve Amendments 1, 2 and 19 (3). </p>
<p class="contents">Another important question of which the Commission is also aware is that of how it may be ensured that EMAS is rolled out in the candidate States at an early stage. The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 3 in principle, provided that the wording is made clearer. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also very pleased to be able to approve Amendment 4 in principle, because it will help ensure that employees are more involved, something which has already been taken into account in the review of EMAS. The wording ought, however, to be changed to avoid extra demands being placed upon companies, particularly upon small and medium-sized companies. </p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be a general concern about small and medium-sized companies, which also manifests itself in EMAS. The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 19 (4) in principle, provided that it does not lead to the EMAS rules’ being watered down for small and medium-sized companies. </p>
<p class="contents">Because EMAS is a voluntary system, it is important that there should be information about it. The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 16 in principle, if it is extended to include all information and not only data. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased to see that the European Parliament itself is committed to applying EMAS and urges the other European institutions to do the same. However, EMAS’s area of application extends to include more than physical assets, something which must be clearly shown in Amendment 22, which the Commission is able to approve in principle. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 25 will contribute considerably to making the EMAS requirements clearer, and the Commission approves this change. A small addendum is required, however, so that the Commission is able, in a legally correct manner, to comply with the contractual conditions in the agreement that has been entered into with the European Standardisation Organisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Unanimity and openness are also important principles for EMAS. The Commission is able to approve Amendments 30 (1 and 3), 32 and 33 (2).</p>
<p class="contents">Where the other changes are concerned, I want briefly to explain why the Commission was unable to approve them. An important aspect of the proposal is the extension of EMAS’s area of application to include all sectors of trade and industry. Those amendments which relate only to the industrial sector cannot, therefore, be approved. These are Amendments 5, 6, 10, 17, 43, 44 and 45, according to which organisations must apply best available technology. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers it important that EMAS should be logically structured, easy to understand and sufficiently flexible to be able to be adapted for the various sectors affected. The Commission cannot, therefore, approve Amendments 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33 (1), 34, 35, 37, 41, 42, 47, 48, 49 and 50.</p>
<p class="contents">The additional benefits to the environment entailed by EMAS, compared with ISO14001, are a crucial aspect of the proposal. The Commission is unable, therefore, to support Amendments 13, 30 (2), 36, 38 and 46. Due to the introduction of longer intervals between verifications of the statements, these amendments would make it more difficult to obtain sight of, and to verify, the information concerning environmental performance. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor can the Commission accept Amendments 39 and 40, because the EMAS logo must be a sign of excellence for organisations, at the same time as it must not lead to confusion on the part of the public. </p>
<p class="contents">Given the way the directives relating to public purchasing look today, Amendment 19 (1) cannot be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased to supply information to the European Parliament upon request, but is unable to approve Amendments 18 and 20 because there is a lack of resources for this purpose. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is unable to approve Amendment 24 relating to committee procedures because of the legal changes implemented following the decision on committee procedures, according to which a prescriptive committee is required. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that the European Parliament’s amendments have, in both readings, contributed greatly to this review and increased EMAS’s potential for helping improve the environmental performance of trade and industry throughout the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
