<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important time for sport in Europe because it is now firmly on the agenda. This has come about quite simply because sport is a popular phenomenon. Europe is responsible for its people and must therefore look after and preserve what is good in sport and try to solve the problems which arise. You may remember that, in Mr Prodi’s inaugural speech to this House, he spoke of the new Commission’s desire to be on close terms with the people and, in this context, he emphasised the importance of fighting the scourge of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is now being achieved. The first stone has been laid today of a structure which will be built to ensure that fair play once again becomes an integral part of sport. The anti-doping campaign will be in two stages. Firstly, the Commission has helped to set up the World Anti-Doping Agency. This was not easy, to say the least. In fact, it was very complicated, but we fought hard and finally achieved this goal. I have been appointed by the Commission to negotiate with the Council and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Samaranch, to ensure that this new anti-doping agency is established on a sound basis.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this basis? Firstly, it must be transparent and independent. Secondly, it must equally represent the worlds of sport and government. Thirdly, all its members worldwide must make solemn the commitment to implement the decisions taken by the agency in their own area. Finally, this agency clearly must be responsible for drawing up the list of banned products, monitoring the laboratories, setting up control systems, establishing out-of-competition tests and enforcing the law. This last item involves combating the gangs which sell banned products. The agency must also be responsible for prevention so that young people dissociate themselves psychologically and actively from the scourge of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I can inform you that the decision makers of the IOC have listened to both the Council and the Commission. Europe’s demands have been entered word for word in the statutes of the new agency and, on 10 November, these statutes were signed. In future we will have two representatives on the board of this agency, as will the Council of Europe. Furthermore, the latter asked us to negotiate on its behalf, so we negotiated not just for the European Union but also for the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is due to the actions of Europe that this agency has come into being. Whether or not it succeeds in its mission no longer depends on us, as we will be but two of thirty to forty partners. We must take the fight forward together and jointly establish the foundations for an anti-doping campaign. We have done our best in this first step and the next steps must be taken together with our worldwide partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have total freedom of movement to make this world agency succeed although we will do everything in our power to ensure this happens, but the other partners must be in agreement. We have therefore decided at the same time to draw up a European plan of action against doping in which we will be totally free to meet our obligations. This plan of action was decided upon this morning by the Commission, bringing together several Commissioners, each responsible for their own area. The Research Commissioner will use the basic or applied research programmes of the Fifth Framework Research programme, as well as other options, in the anti-doping campaign in order to reinforce the means available to this campaign. The Education and Youth Commissioner will allow the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth programmes to be used for providing training and establishing cooperation between young people so that the anti-doping campaign becomes something that is sought after by European youth. The Health Commissioner will ensure that the existing directives, for example, on labelling of medicines for human use, are also developed in terms of anti-doping. He has also promised to submit a recommendation covering all the issues of public health, health of young sportspeople and health of sportspeople in general for wide-ranging and concerted action by the Member States in the campaign against doping. On the enforcement side, the Commissioner responsible for third pillar issues, namely internal policies, will use existing plans and programmes to make the forces of law and order aware of this anti-doping campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you know that from next year, at both world and European level, we are going to make the anti-doping campaign a spearhead of our sports policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a second plan. During the Vienna Summit, the governments asked us to submit for the Helsinki Summit a document on sport as an element of society, or social sport. This House, on 17 December last year I believe, adopted a resolution on this same subject. We are about to fulfil our mandate because the Commission has decided to submit a plan concerning a communication on preserving current sports structures and the social function of sports in the Community framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Commission and the EU have no legal basis for starting to lay down regulations. We will not do this, because we do not have the power to do this. However, in all the political areas where we do have a legal basis we will use the existing means to work for sport. I can give you a very specific example. In the Structural Funds, a significant part of the money can be allocated to projects in favour of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a new approach with regard to the people of Europe. The Commission does not want to appear to be shut off in its ivory tower devising regulations to impose on the good people. Absolutely not. We believe that our role is to find a consensus between those who, in the Member States, have political responsibility and those who, in the world of sport, have responsibility for organising sport. We are all going to get round a table to discuss, listen and find out what is not working and propose solutions which respect the independence of sports federations and the subsidiarity implemented in our fifteen Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Before then we will start to look at the benefits and obstacles to sport in European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, some practices have nothing to do with the rules on competition. Therefore, the fact that a football team has eleven players has nothing to do with competition. This aspect is completely outside the area of competition. There are also practices which are, in principle, prohibited under the rules on competition. For example, if, during a major championship, tickets are sold only to nationals and sales to non-nationals or other European citizens are refused, this contravenes the rules on competition and positive action must be taken against this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, where there is an apparent conflict with the rules on competition but the sports federations undertake in their actions to use the funds raised to bring education and social action to sport, some practices are then likely to be exempted from the rules on competition. I can give you a specific example of this. Some federations have up to now collectively sold audiovisual rights. If this monopoly action only benefits the business world, it is clear that this comes under business. However, if the money raised is distributed to the clubs which provide education and training to youngsters, this action is in the collective interest and an exemption from the rules on competition is allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have briefly explained how we will act in the future with regard to the new sports policy to be introduced. From next year, a wide-ranging dialogue will be held with all the federations, large or small, and the politicians in our Member States so that together we can decide how to ‘regulate’. The aim will not be to draw up new rules but to establish barriers and safeguards so that everything is clear. We must work together in the interests of our young people, fair play and the commitment of sport to society in its fight against racism and xenophobia. Sport must be positive and accessible. This is something we all want but which is rarely the case at the moment.</p>

In order to combat doping, there is one thing which we must do as a European Union. This is to fight against the over-commercialisation of sport which has led to a threefold increase in competitions. This is the reason for all the doping. While the Tour de France and the Giro d’Italia are as long as they are, and there are three matches per week for professional football teams, drugs will be used. While sport and the number of competitions are left unregulated, drugs will be used. If we do not do our duty by preparing a European directive on the protection of sportspeople, including professionals, we will not be tackling the root causes of doping.</p>

I have discussed this with many professional sportspeople and the main reason they give for being virtually forced to take drugs is exactly the reason given by Mr Cohn-Bendit. However, he should know that, without a legal basis to prepare a directive on sport, we cannot act in the way he wishes. The only thing we can do, in this round table with the federations, is ask them to bring good sense into play and to re-establish the prestige of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the equal representation of the worlds of sport and government in the World Anti-Doping Agency and given all those who will sit on the board of this agency – all the federations and all the National Olympic Committees – who have all undertaken to implement, in their own area, the decisions taken by the agency, there is real hope. If the agency were to adopt a directive, for example, so that sporting events could be returned to a scale which was humanly possible for sportspeople, this would be a major step forward, but I cannot go further than I am authorised. It will be up to the agency to act in this respect. However, I can tell the honourable Member that the European authorities will work in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must not be forgotten that sport in Europe was born of the oldest known truce, namely the sacred truce which gave rise to the Olympics. This means that it also has a political value of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Hundreds of thousands of young people, both male and female, start and develop their education through sport. I have a question concerning the last comment made by the Commissioner. In addition to being a social and training activity, sport is currently part of the world of big business and is actually one of the most important business activities. My question is as follows: Does the Commission intend the policy which must be developed on sport, particularly in view of the concentration of power which is occurring in the audiovisual media, to lead to a joint action between her Directorate-General and the one responsible for defending competition? I believe that this is one of the key questions for Europe and the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are keen to see order restored and balance re-established in sport and to ensure that sport as fair play and true competition regains its prestige. This will not be easy as this is an enormous task, but I believe that, with the help of politicians and through public assistance and pressure, we can achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very clear that we can act on sport only in its social and educational aspects. When sport becomes a purely business matter, there can be no exceptions. Sport will, at this point, be dealt with like any other business activity. That is plain and clear. It is only when sport fulfils an important social function that we can give it a helping hand in order to restore order. Sport as a business will be regarded and dealt with like any other business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only hope that you will make some proper headway with the people who always make out that they would fight doping. I think we are on the right track and I wish you luck.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to come back to what my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit said. We cannot legislate because, as you said, there is no legal basis in the Treaty. As you know, in my 1996 report, I called, on behalf of Parliament, for sport to be included in the Treaty at long last. We wanted it to have its own line in Article 128 – under culture. But we failed. There is something like a declaration attached to the Treaty, but it is not enough to prevent our having to ask ourselves every year when we debate the budget, should we or should we not fund sport? I think that if what you have said, if what you submit to the Council in Helsinki is to make sense, then we must conclude that the European Parliament is not confined to making statements on Bosman judgements or competition issues in sport, but can give sport a true value by paying more than mere lip service to it in the Treaty. Only then will we be able to do what my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit said, only then will we be able to use the budget to give constructive support to cross-border sporting events.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you from the bottom of my heart to persuade your colleagues at the Commission to take a real step forward with the Council in Helsinki by including a sub-section on sport in the Treaty. Only then will we be able to make any real progress on this issue!</p>

Unfortunately, she is right. My life would be far easier if I were able to construct a sports policy on the basis of an article in the Treaty. But, unfortunately, I have no such facility. Only the Intergovernmental Conference could give me this facility if they were to sit down and include an article on sport in the Treaty. Could, if etc. etc. Will it happen? I hope so, I pray so, I dream so. But, as things stand, I can only say that most governments are against an article on sport in the Treaty, although there are governments which want to move in this direction. I would like to see Parliament extend its lobbying activities on sport by helping and convincing the various governments to vote for a legal basis for sport in the Treaty similar to, and this would be most satisfactory for the purposes of subsidiarity, the legal basis for culture. That would make our life much easier, but it is just wishful thinking and pie in the sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She answered Mr Cohn-Bendit’s question by saying that she has no legal basis to act against this over-professionalisation of sport. Yet, in answer to the question of Mr Barón Crespo, she said that she intends to act when it is a matter of business.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Treaty gives the Commission very few means of proposing directives, but it is clear that organisations such as the Tour de France, the Giro d’Italia, the Tennis Masters and many others are pure business. These are profit-making activities and, seen from this perspective, the Commission could therefore at least try to regulate the sector and its working conditions to a certain extent. As Mr Cohn-Bendit very rightly said, if sportspeople take drugs, it is because the competitions require this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I never said that I will not act when sport becomes commercial, in fact I said the contrary. I said that when sport is a purely economic and business activity, this is when the rules on competition will fully apply to prevent any deviations in sport. I will indeed act when sport, as a social activity, is threatened by the rules on competition. This is when the Commission will be ready to introduce corrective measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that sport is being blown off course on account of its business aspect. This is why we must help sport at the level which is of interest to all the people of Europe, not just as entertainment, but also as an educational activity, promoting solidarity between people, both young and old, and also between the various nations. At this point we can do something. When sport is a business, it must be regarded like any other business in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you have just said, sport has a very important place in daily life in Europe and must therefore be afforded this same status in the European Parliament, as Mr Prodi said in his inaugural speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations are also in order for your work in setting up the World Anti-Doping Agency. However, as a sportswoman, I must also ask that, as well as taking the positive step of imposing strict rules on athletes with regard to doping, we should listen to them and put their interests above economic and business interests. This has not always been the case to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it seems that the Council wants to eliminate the budget heading on sport at second reading. As a sportswoman, a European citizen and a Member of this House, I must very firmly indicate my disagreement with this Council proposal. Also, what steps is the Commission intending to take to ensure that sport has a budget in the European Union, so that we can work from here for European sport? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, if we have some great champions in this House, which we do, I thank them in advance for giving me a hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand the frustration at not being able to do more. Believe me, I am the first to be frustrated because, if I had a legal basis, I could demand a budget. I could, together with this House, press forward and develop programmes for our youngsters and for our sportspeople. Unfortunately, I have no legal basis. Without this, I will have no budget heading. I am therefore forced to be creative, to innovate and to find sources other than direct sources. This is why our anti-doping plan intends to use all the policies which, in one way or another, can help to fight this scourge, such as research, health, education and the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like nothing more than to escape from this impasse. So if this House can persuade the governments of the Fifteen, during the Intergovernmental Conference, to introduce an article into the EC Treaty allowing us to establish a proper sports policy, I will be the first to cheer and applaud.</p>
