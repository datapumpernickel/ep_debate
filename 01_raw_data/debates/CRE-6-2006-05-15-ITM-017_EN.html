<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. Mr President, I welcome Parliament’s report on the Commission’s proposal concerning eels and would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for his good work.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that Parliament has taken very seriously the grave threat to the European eel population. Parliament has made a number of helpful and practical suggestions to improve the proposal. I can support many of the amendments as they stand. A number of others I can support in principle, but not their inclusion in the proposal, because they should be dealt with in another way. A small number of other issues require further scientific analysis before they can be implemented practically.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 21, 22, 23, 27 and 29. I agree that Member States should be able to choose their own closed seasons to reduce fishing effort by 50% and that the timescale of the proposal should be lengthened so that Member States can better develop management plans and have more flexibility in defining the areas to which eel management plans should apply. I also accept that Member States should be able to move forwards individually if difficulties arise in developing management plans in cooperation between several states.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several amendments proposed to which I am sympathetic in principle, but which concern issues that I believe should be addressed differently. Amendments 4, 8 and 11 concern implementation and further research on the way aquaculture could be involved in improving the stocking of European waters with eels. Research needs cannot be addressed directly in a Council regulation of this type. Funding through the framework programmes and consultation of advisory bodies, such as the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, are more appropriate ways to further research. I will ensure that these more appropriate methods for commissioning research are used. Until the results of the research requested in Amendment 4 are available, it would be premature to proceed with implementation as requested in Amendments 8 and 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 5 and 25 concern exports of glass eels. This is a trade issue. Once the Community has developed internal conservation measures for eels, the Community could then develop export restrictions that would favour and protect the use of eels for populating Community inland waters. My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, is aware of this issue and he will begin preparing export measures for glass eels once the Council has taken a decision on eel conservation. In order to ensure compatibility with the World Trade Organization rules, conservation measures within our own waters must be the first step.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 9 expresses a good idea: migration of glass eels should not be obstructed. However, I consider it would be more in the spirit of the developed approach adopted in this proposed regulation that Member States should make such choices themselves in the context of eel management measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 16 is no longer necessary, because I have accepted that Member States can have flexibility in the definition of eel river basins, as requested in Amendment 13.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the principle expressed in Amendment 17, but the possibility for several Member States to prepare a joint management plan is already covered in Article 8. Amendments 18 and 28 concern the targets and implementing methods to achieve eel stock recovery. Here I refer to the latest advice of the STECF. This advice tells us that it is extremely difficult to measure eel escapement and that it is preferable to focus on directly applicable measures such as a 50% reduction in the impact on eels due to fishing and a similar reduction in the effect on eels of fixed installations such as turbines and pumps. I believe we should proceed on this basis at present, but Member States should improve and refine data collection concerning eels in order to improve management targets and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 19 and 20 concern financial aid for restocking and for constructing passes for eels. I support these ideas so long as restocking results in improved silver eel escapement, but as these ideas are to be included in the new European Fisheries Fund regulation, this piece of legislation is not the right place for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept that the burden caused by the need for reports should be lightened, as proposed in Amendment 26, but this could take place through less frequent reports. It is still necessary for Member States to improve substantially the collection of data, so a requirement to improve the scientific basis for eel management is an important part of my proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 24 suggests extending eel management plans to coastal waters and, in particular, to the Baltic Sea. I agree that management of eel fisheries in coastal areas is important, but it would not be technically feasible at present to apply an escapement target to sea fisheries, because this cannot be measured. Indeed, I will support the inclusion of marine fisheries for eels as fisheries that should be subject to a 50% reduction of general fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for their very positive cooperation in the preparation of this report. I sincerely hope that, by making a significant and substantial effort in the near future, it will be possible to improve considerably the situation of eel stocks in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will return in due course to a number observations pertaining to amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">First, though, I should like to consider the object of this debate. After all, this debate about the regulation for the recovery of eel stocks shows that the European Parliament can lay down legislation, even in areas where it only has advisory powers. Although fishing in inland waters is strictly speaking a matter for the Member States and not for the European Union, in close cooperation with my fellow MEPs and Mr Borg, the European Commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs, we have managed quite literally to give eels a helping hand.</p>
<p class="contents">What is so special about eel is that it is both a freshwater and salt water fish. While the regulation for fisheries is a matter for the EU, inland waterways fall within the remit of the Member States. As such, the eel has been overlooked for years. Since there was no legislation at European or national level, the eel slipped, time after time, through the legislator’s nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Eel stocks have now declined dramatically. Over the past 50 years, stocks of young eel at sea, so-called glass eel, have declined by more than 95%. With only 25% of adult eel left, they have not fared much better. It is therefore high time we sprung into action to save the European eel, and a broad and comprehensive approach is desperately needed. For that reason, I would also thank Commissioner Borg for the swiftness with which he has translated Parliament’s own-initiative report into a proposal for a regulation. After all, only a unanimous stance of all those involved, including professional fisheries, recreational fisheries, regional and national authorities, environmental and nature organisations, can bring about a U-turn. It is therefore unique that the new initiative to rescue eel should be supported by all those parties in the manner I will describe to you now.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to get eel stocks to recover, it has been decided to reduce eel-fishing by half. Member States can, however, instead of this reduction by half – which, in practice would often lead to closure – also draft a management plan for the recovery of eel. They can do so for the entire territory, a region or for a river basin. This management plan could become the ultimate form of cooperation between all parties involved. This does not require any action from on high – from Brussels or the Member States’ capitals – but from the bottom up, involving citizens and people on the job.</p>
<p class="contents">This method can regulate the exports of glass eel and is eminently usable for European rivers, canals and lakes. Also, this recovery plan hugely promotes technical measures, such as hydro-electric power stations, sluices and dikes, thus making unhindered fish migration possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad, north-to-south, support in Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries is the key to successful decision-making in the European Fisheries Council. If the European Commission adopts the adjustments proposed by Parliament, as the Commissioner indicated with regard to a large number of points, successful decision-making can be guaranteed with a wide support base – from Sweden to Spain – of fishermen, recreational fishermen and environmental organisations alike. That also means that the Commission and Council should not let this unique opportunity slip.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for adopting a large number of the amendments. I am also indebted to him for the initiatives he has taken with Mr Mandelson, particularly with regard to international trade policy, in order to better regulate not only the catch of glass eel but also the exports in this area. This offers prospects for glass eel as a venture, in European waters as well as elsewhere, which also makes it possible to work towards sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner was right to observe that Parliament has deleted a specific sustainability criterion from an amendment and has indicated that he, in tandem with technical experts, would like to find out how an objective measuring method can be arrived at after all. I welcome this, for this also reflects the mood in Parliament. The specific number 40%, however, did cause problems here and there, and perhaps regional differences can also be taken into consideration in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, I am pleased that the Commissioner has accepted a large number of amendments. As for trade policy and a number of other areas, I am convinced that we will now manage to achieve much better eel stocks in the European Union in five or ten years’ time. This is something that will benefit everyone, not only the public, but also fisheries, recreational fishermen and everyone who cares about eel. I would thank the fellow Members once again for the excellent teamwork during the preparation of this report and I am looking forward to the debate that will follow and also the vote on my report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rigidity of the Commission’s proposal, its obfuscation in ignoring the biological behaviour of eels, whose capture is closely linked to lunar phases, and the injustice of seeing fishing as the only cause of the reduction in the eel population, have been replaced by a compromise by the rapporteur. We must thank him for his flexibility and his sensitivity in listening to the different fleets fishing eel during all of the phases of their lives and in habitats and river basins that vary enormously throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal was rejected by the sector in all of the countries of the Union, by national administrations and by this Parliament. Mr Maat’s report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries and has restored calm. The Commission must therefore take good note.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the urgent need to recover eel stocks and the proposal is therefore to reduce the fishing effort by half. Nevertheless, a reasonable way to do so is being proposed, replacing the Commission’s absurd proposal that fishing be halted from the first to the fifteenth day of each month.</p>
<p class="contents">The obligation for future national plans to guarantee a 40% escape rate for eels, something that is practically impossible to calculate, is also removed and replaced by measures that guarantee a high escape rate for adult eel and, to this end, it is requested that account be taken not just of fishing, but of all human activities along rivers that hinder or prevent the return of eel to the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the report by Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries is a balanced and measured consensus report and, in line with what the Commissioner has said, I hope that both he and the Council will take good note of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tradition is now threatened, not only in Denmark but throughout the Community, as a result of the critical state of the eel stock. The European eel is now so overfished that the stock is only around 1% of what it was in the past. This is not only a precarious situation, it is also a great challenge for the common fisheries policy. In the end, one may add, it is also the last chance.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of this report is for each Member State to produce a national Eel Management Plan for each and every river basin, and precisely the fact that the report covers each and every river basin is very important. These plans are intended to make it highly probable that a high percentage of the biomass of adult eels will be able to escape back to sea. Under the Commission’s original proposal, there was to be a sea-return rate of around 40%. This, in my opinion, was a positive feature and, in fact, I would also have preferred us to have retained it.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that I am very happy about – and another thing that Mr Maat was involved in – is that we will now be having special measures to ensure that the restocking of fry can continue. It is absolutely critical that we have fry, because, if we do not, then we have no possibility of rebuilding our stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that, through his report, Mr Maat has produced some good work, and I would very much like to thank him for that. I believe that we now have before us something that can be made use of and that has great significance for all of us, and I hope that both Parliament’s contribution and the debate to take place amongst the fisheries ministers in the Council will result in the development of an action plan that will lead to the rebuilding of the eel stock. As I said at the beginning, we are now at the stage where the situation is such that, if an effective effort is not made on the part of each and every Member State, eels within the Community, as such, will be a thing of the past. We have an obligation to safeguard the stock of eels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With a view to tackling this situation, the Commission is presenting us with a proposal for a Regulation containing measures which reflect good intentions but which, in my humble opinion, could be improved. In the Basque Country, which I represent here, we are not just well acquainted with the adult eel, but also its young – the elver – which has historically been an ingredient in one of the most succulent and highly-prized dishes in our cuisine.</p>
<p class="contents">For this historical reason, we are aware that the life cycle of our eel is very long, that it is a migratory species and that the females, before dying, travel for a year to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where they lay up to 20 million leaf-shaped eggs which float freely in ball-shaped groups and are carried by sea currents, taking a year to reach the North American coasts and up to three years to reach European coasts. When they reach our rivers they have undergone a metamorphosis: they have become elvers and they carry on growing until they mature into eels.</p>
<p class="contents">Since their fishing depends on the lunar cycle, the ban on their fishing from the first to the fifteenth day of each month could lead either to the almost complete closure of that fishing or, quite the opposite, it may have no effect on it, depending on the phase of the moon during that fortnight. It would be more effective to reduce the fishing season in such a way as to reduce the fishing effort by half.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposed timetable does not appear viable, since the plans require coordination amongst different regions and Member States, and that takes time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since the current knowledge for calculating escape rate is not sufficient and the models currently being investigated within the SLIME project will not be available in the immediate future, the best option is to delay until 2008 the authorisation to fish eel during seasonal bans, as an exception based on a particular management plan. We know that many people live from eel fishing and we cannot destroy the sector, but rather we must find a balance which guarantees the survival of resources at the same time.</p>

They converge in the Sargasso Sea from throughout Europe in order to meet each other and produce offspring, irrespective of national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last 40 years, however, eel stocks have declined by more than 75%. The most rapid decline has taken place over the last 20 years. It takes eels 20 years or more to reach sexual maturity, and it will be many years before we are able to fish for those eels being born today. This also means that it will be many years before we get to see the results of the measures, so it is time for all countries to help each other. Eels have already taken more of a beating than they can tolerate. Given that eels are a symbol of cross-border cooperation, it would be a symbolic failure for the whole of the EU and in terms of the whole future of the EU if we did not succeed in saving the eel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So there is a question as to whether aspects of this proposal are <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Northern Ireland we have the largest commercial wild-eel fishery in Europe, centred on Lough Neagh and the lower River Bann. It supplies quality eels to much of Europe, particularly northern Europe. Efficiently run, it has been meeting its ecological obligations by already ensuring sufficient escapement of mature eels for spawning, and, at its own cost, funding restocking with junior eels. It would be absurd if it were now to be subjected to punitive restrictions because the greed and practices of others elsewhere in Europe have radically diminished European stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cause of stock reduction is the export of elvers to the Far East. Last year, France alone exported eight tonnes of elvers. I therefore welcome the report’s attempts to curb this exporting of the future of the European eel industry. I also welcome moves to insist that eel farms should guarantee a percentage escapement of mature eels. All have a part to play in the recovery of the biomass, but particularly those who have to date squandered our resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the rejection of a 15-day closure per month and I favour eel management plans that are specific to each individual river basin, rather than established on a national basis. I believe that will enable areas such as mine, which have looked after their product well and properly, to continue and to avoid draconian and unnecessary restrictions. That self-regulation and control should be an example to others.</p>

In many rivers, eels migrating upstream for spawning have fallen by over 95%. We are heading for an ecological disaster. Everyone recognised earlier – and we all agree on this – that we need to take measures to deal with this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The target has been set: the escapement of adult eels must be at least 40%. However, we propose the following: the measures taken must not be fragmentary; they must be scientifically proven and must be taken in cooperation with fishermen. We need the fishermen, because they know the subject better than anyone and, at the same time, we need their consent and their cooperation to ensure the measures are more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard with a great deal of pleasure – as many others acknowledged – that it is not just fishermen who are to blame for the present situation. Pollution is to blame, various technical works are to blame and many other factors are to blame. However, what is important is the final finding on the matter in question. Account also needs to be taken of the peculiarities of each Member State and of the differences between free and controlled fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would emphasise that we need to consider how we are to combat copious uncontrolled exports to third countries, because if we leave them free, with the trend described today, we shall empty our waters of eels and we shall not have any to send to the Orient anyway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Communication proposed actions such as the prohibition of fishing gear intended for the capture of silver eels in certain areas, measures to facilitate their emigration downstream and also, finally, additional proposals intended to improve the survival rate during other phases of their life cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission justified this sequence with the premise that the advantages resulting from a reduction in the fishing of young eel are still uncertain and it stressed its belief that the evolution of the population depended on factors other than fishing, the pollution of riverbeds, the disappearance of habitats, the non-maintenance of ecological values and obstacles to upstream and downstream migrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with this approach – with which I agree – we ended up with a proposed Regulation which points to fishing as solely responsible for the European eel population falling outside of the biological safety limits. The proposal also includes an arbitrary fifteen-day ban that lacks any biological justification. a ban on fishing, landing or conserving eels from the first to the fifteenth day of each month.</p>
<p class="contents">These are drastic, erroneous and supplemented measures with an objective that is very difficult to define or monitor – the escape to the sea of 40% of the biomass of adult eel.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the report by the Committee on Fisheries and the work by the rapporteur, Mr Maat, corrects these two serious problems and they will naturally have our support. I would also like to address the People’s Party and our rapporteur, Mr Maat, to ask them not to start fires and then end up having to put them out, and I am talking specifically about the proposal for a ban on elvers, which would have extremely serious consequences for certain regions in my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the species migrates three times over - in the Atlantic, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, for example, and from the sea to the river - the fate of eels clearly serves to remind us that the world is interdependent, especially when the sudden rise in demand from the East encourages fishing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, the everyday reality for eels is one of being caught by locals, for example in pools on the edge of the Mediterranean in the South of France. There, hundreds of fishermen make their living from that activity. To ban them from fishing for two weeks a month, while booms, cormorants, power stations and oceanic disturbances place a strain on the life cycle of eels, is unjust and ineffective, and that is where subsidiarity must come into play. Let us leave it to the fishermens’ <span class="italic">prud'homies</span> - the professional organisations - to look into the fate of eels more closely. The survival of eels does not depend on Community federalism, but on the action of local professional organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Global demand for European eels is estimated at approximately 200 tonnes. In recent years, however, the catch of glass eels has been decreasing. In 2004 barely 130 tonnes were caught and in 2005 the figure fell to 75 tonnes. As a result, the price of glass eels rose rapidly: from EUR 300-400 in the mid-1990s to EUR 1200 in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Eel production has basically ceased to be viable in Europe. A particularly difficult situation is faced by those countries that have a very limited access to free sources of glass eel stocks. This includes the majority of the Baltic States. As we know, this situation is the result of the decline in the number of glass eels migrating from marine waters to inland waters. In turn, the low level of glass eel stocks forces these countries to import fish rearing material. However, they are facing a growing number of financial restrictions resulting from the rising price of glass eels in Europe. The new Member States from the Baltic region are being burdened with the very high prices for glass eel exports to Asian countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this situation in mind, a system needs to be created that is based on ensuring that the costs of protecting glass eel stocks are fairly distributed among all interested parties. This, of course, also includes exporters and importers of glass eels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The biggest problem is the fishing of elvers. The problem is that they are so valuable, probably as valuable as gold, and for this reason people collect them. If we could reduce the number of elvers being taken, then we would build up the eel population.</p>
<p class="contents">On my own farm, people sometimes fish illegally by letting fresh water out into the salt water to attract the elvers and then catch them. It is not always easy to catch the people who are catching the elvers. We need to control the quantity of elvers sold in each Member State. These elvers are collected in tanks in local towns and villages and it should not be too difficult for the authorities to clamp down on where they are being sold.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good idea to rejuvenate stocks and give money for this purpose. However, it is much more sensible to allow the wild elvers coming back from the sea to swim up the rivers and develop into large eels. Then we can either catch them and eat them as whole eels or use them to replenish the stocks. The problem is not the lack of eels but the fact that we catch them when they are very small.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report, because it is time that we took action. Otherwise we will be talking here for so long that by the time we have finished there will be no eels – either elvers or mature eels – left for us to catch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this measure will produce the desired results and that it is not too late.</p>
<p class="contents">If one looks at the figures, the situation is almost catastrophic. Mr Gklavakis mentioned that stocks of eels are about 90 to 95% less than historic levels, which has been confirmed by the scientific research into levels of stocks of eels and silver eels in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree more that it is a bottom-up approach, not a top-down approach, and that the Commission would like to have more of this. That is why we are trying to involve the sector more and more, by setting up regional advisory councils and by listening to the European Parliament, which is always very close to the grass roots of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had an open approach and came up with a proposal, for want of a more appropriate and specific approach, because when we talked to the sector we did not, at that juncture, find a more appropriate solution than the 15-day closure in the original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission is willing to accept the proposal Parliament presented to it, since that would work towards replenishing eel stocks in a way that would produce results without too much difficulty for the sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mrs Miguélez Ramos mentioned that the Commission proposal was rejected by the sector. That is true, but the proposal at least served to launch the debate in order to try to find the most appropriate solution for the whole question of eel management. With Parliament’s amendments, which the Commission has accepted, we can now speak of a measure that can move towards producing results and has a reasonable prospect of success.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kristensen mentioned that the Commission proposal underlines the need for management plans by Member States at national or regional level, and with the amendment proposed by Parliament we can move ahead with reasonable prospects of success at those levels.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, on the points made by Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Martinez, closure for the first 15 days of the month was proposed for want of a better proposal. The amendment before us has been accepted and even the extension of the implementation period has been accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the comments by Mr Schlyter, Mrs de Brún and Mr Parish and I have taken note of the points raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Allister raised the question of <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>. The Commission’s view is that conservation measures are not <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>. If a country or region manages stock of eels or other inland fisheries properly, certainly no intervention would be solicited or required and therefore self-regulation and control would continue. However, where the situation requires intervention for conservation purposes, the Commission would have the right to intervene on behalf of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Export measures will be undertaken separately, but we must first set our own house in order, because, at the end of the day, if we go to international fora presenting measures that would curtail exports, they would be immediately attacked if we have not introduced measures to rectify our own situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the point raised by Mr Chmielewski, I have taken note of the points he raised and we will look into them, especially in conjunction with possible funding under the European Fisheries Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My country, Estonia, is surrounded by sea on two sides, and on the third by a large lake. Fish have played an important role in our economy and culture for centuries, and we know well how complicated and sensitive a topic this is.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifty-year-long Cold War and arms race also took place in the area of fisheries. Their legacy is enormous fishing capacities and fish stocks that cannot be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to restore the natural cycle, fishing must be reduced by as much as 60% in some places. Former fishermen are unable to find other work, and fishing boats purchased with European Union aid are now being made into scrap metal with European Union aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The replenishment of eel stocks will be a test of international cooperation. Glass eels are threatened by demand from Asia, and the passage of eels of reproductive age from inland waters to the sea is influenced by man-made obstacles, such as the dam of the Russian-owned hydroelectric power station on the Estonian border.</p>
<p class="contents">Such problems cannot be solved without effective international cooperation. I expect effective action from Member States and the European Commission in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, expect intervention on a detailed level. I am glad that this report introduces an amendment to the initial text, which had established fishing restrictions for specific periods. Traditional fishing families in coastal villages know best how to fish sustainably, but industrial fishing on the high seas has brought their lifestyle to the brink of extinction.</p>
<p class="contents">They too need purposeful support: without them and their knowledge, it may prove impossible to restore a sustainable fishery in Estonia.</p>
