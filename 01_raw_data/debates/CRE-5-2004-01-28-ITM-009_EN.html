The effectiveness of the codecision procedure has made a substantial contribution in this case. People’s demands for development, increased growth and more jobs have now met with a response. The conciliation concerning public procurement, which we are now to debate, is an expression of this. It is necessary to modernise the European market and open it to public procurement in order to increase European competitiveness. The directive on public procurement stipulates full competition between tenderers. Complete transparency and equal treatment are guaranteed. That is of benefit both to European taxpayers, who obtain better value for money, and to the innumerable companies that are now being given the opportunity to compete for contracts throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">From Parliament’s point of view, the conciliation was a success. There were few of us who, at the beginning, had believed that the final outcome would be so close to our starting position. The administration of procurement will be considerably simplified. The directive will be simpler and clearer than its predecessor, and there will be increased user-friendliness, especially as a result of the electronic trading centres that are to be established, a development that will simplify matters for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited administrative resources. Improved dialogue between suppliers and those who issue contracts has been built into the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim was to increase competitiveness, to promote equal treatment and to improve our tools for combating organised crime and corruption. It was necessary to increase transparency and, in particular, information about who has obtained a contract and why. It was these issues and the opportunity of introducing social and environmental considerations that, more than anything else, forced the conciliation. The directive prevents social and environmental aspects being taken account of in an arbitrary or unbalanced way. Thought can, however, still be given to such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We obtained a balance with the aid of the EC Court of Justice’s jurisdiction, whose case law was implemented, a factor that provides legal certainty in this area. For this encouraging outcome, I wish especially to thank both the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Berger, whose input has been considerable. I also especially wish to thank both the entire parliamentary delegation and the two Commissioners who are present today and who, to use a homely turn of phrase, have not let the grass grow under their feet but really have made major practical contributions. I even wish, unusually for an MEP, to thank the Presidency, which dealt with this issue and with which we negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Without all these combined efforts, it would have been impossible to take this step. We should not have been able to come so far if all the parties had not had the practical political will to deliver to Europe in this area. The outcome, therefore, was agreement, in spite of quite difficult political antagonisms at the start. We expect this step to contribute to more intensive European trade, the consequence being gains in terms of prosperity for the EU, our citizens and our European populations. Thank you, all who have contributed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   C<span class="italic">ommission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we are today on the verge of adopting the most comprehensive reform of EU public procurement law since the set up of the internal market. It simplifies and modernises our legislation and gives to the public sector and to industry the means to cut costs and enhance competitiveness. The importance of this piece of legislation for reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy is remarkable. Indeed, public procurement is an important part of the internal market, not only because of its volume – for 2002 public procurement amounted to approximately EUR 1500 billion: more than 16% of GDP or, in other words, more than half of the German GDP – but also because of the great potential for further savings for European citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent draft report on the functioning of public procurement markets in the EU shows that the procurement directives have contributed to increased transparency in public procurement markets. The new evidence, based on a sample of firms and public authorities, suggests that increased transparency has effectively resulted in more cross-border competition, price convergence and lower prices for goods and services purchased by public authorities. Most importantly, this evidence shows that economic reforms work and pay off. So much so, that the report strongly suggests that further savings are possible in this area. Case studies show that savings of the order of 12% could have been made over the period 1998–2002. The potential importance of this is quite remarkable: if savings of 10% could be made, then 5 countries would turn their budget deficits into surpluses and no eurozone Member State would run a public sector deficit that would break the Stability and Growth Pact's 3% limit! This is quite remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the report recognises that problems, such as transaction costs, remain. To address such problems, the legislative package in front of you will help with e-procurement, offering new possibilities for cost reductions. If promptly adopted and effectively implemented by Member States, these measures will contribute to further improve the performance of our public procurement markets. However important the economic aspects of public procurement may be, they should not be our exclusive focus – other major policies in the social and environmental fields also need to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would like to compliment the Conciliation Committee – and Mrs Cederschiöld – for their excellent work in reaching a well-balanced compromise which fully consolidates and safeguards the advances made by the current jurisprudence as regards the possibilities of using environmental and social award criteria. Furthermore, as Mrs Cederschiöld said, I would like to emphasise the convergence between this solution and the latest Court of Justice ruling of 4 December 2003 – two days after the Conciliation Committee meeting – which confirmed the four conditions agreed upon in conciliation that are to be fulfilled by award criteria in order to be valid. Provided these conditions are met, production methods could be used as award criteria without being mentioned explicitly. Award criteria such as those dealt with in the recent judgment of 4 December will continue to be possible and will, furthermore, be based on clearer legal texts.</p>
<p class="contents">This confirms one of the merits of this legislative package, namely that the general clarification and simplification of the legislation will lead to more legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to address the situation of certain professions with key roles to play in ensuring high quality when procuring. In this respect, the legislative package will – thanks to the extensive work of the rapporteur – recognise this role and take the particular, qualitative aspects of such services into better account.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I appeal to the Members of this House to support the results of this conciliation process and finally to adopt this important piece of legislation. Once again, I should like to thank all Members who have contributed to the excellent outcome of the various debates held on this important matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not, therefore, dwell on the importance or the content of the directive, which have already been the subject of many meetings and many debates. I would merely like to quickly take the opportunity to make two remarks: the first is to point out that this directive will enter into force just when enlargement takes place, making things run more smoothly not just for the 15 current Member States, but also for the 25 which will, in a few months’ time, be Members of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly welcome what Commissioner Bolkestein said as regards quality. I tried many times, as rapporteur, to stress the issue of quality above all. I know that the Commission is moving in this direction with other initiatives, and I therefore hope that, when a contract is awarded using the principle of the quality/price ratio, quality will always come out on top, above all in professional services.</p>
<p class="contents">Having, as rapporteur, spent four years on this issue, together with many other Members, I would conclude by impartially thanking all those responsible for such an important result for the European Union: the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, to which I dedicated a considerable amount of my time, for having conducted the final stage in the committee extremely proficiently; and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Bolkestein. I would also, however, like to mention Mr Vattela and all his team, with whom we worked for a long time, often disagreeing but certainly in the constructive spirit of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, furthermore, like to mention and thank the Chairman, now the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who chaired the committee and did a great deal of work on this issue, namely Mrs de Palacio; the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who gave me this task, and for doing so I therefore thank the Chairman Mr Poettering; the current Chairman, Mr Gargani, and also all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in particular Mrs Berger who, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, was so patient and with whom we concluded a significant process; my colleague Mr Lehne, coordinator of the European People’s Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; the lawyer Mr Preto, who was certainly extremely valuable in bringing about everything that we have achieved; all the shadow rapporteurs; and, to conclude, the Italian Presidency. During the last six months, the Presidency has finished a task that began a long time before the Spanish Presidency and, together with Mr Buttiglione and all of the Italian delegation, it has allowed us, for everyone’s benefit, to bring this story to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">Having dedicated most of this parliamentary term to this activity, I am happy. Now a new one is beginning, but this is certainly a milestone for the conclusion of the European internal market. I therefore thank everyone; I thank you, Mr President, and, once again, all the Members for the opportunity given to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me thank the Commission, and also the Commissioner, who again reminded us today how very important this legislative project is in economic terms. When getting to grips with one formulation or another, one is all too ready to lose sight of the whole and no longer quite see how very important this project is, and I think it is vital that we should remind ourselves of that as things draw to a close. I also want to thank Mr Zappalà, the rapporteur, who has had to be very patient with me as I expressed what I sought. Opinions may differ about the Italian Presidency’s record, and different people in this House will assess it in different ways, but it can certainly chalk up as one of its credits the successful completion of this conciliation procedure, the result of which I will of course, tomorrow, be advising my group to adopt. I am not doing that half-heartedly, merely because it is a compromise, but because I am convinced that 90% of our result is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a number of points that were of particular concern to us in Parliament and can be said to be enshrined in the outcome. We of course share the Commission’s goal of simplification and modernisation, which I see as having been largely achieved. It was important to us that electronic procedures should be made easier and electronic auctions introduced. When it came to the threshold values, we had differences of opinion. I regard the slight increase in the threshold values from what they had been previously as a good solution, especially because this means that smaller contracting authorities, such as municipalities, do not have to put projects in their area out to tender right across Europe, whilst the internal market continues to apply to larger projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see it as significant that it has been possible to rethink the Utilities Directive, and, in particular, that we have succeeded in transferring postal services to it from their traditional directive, for this had been one of this House’s concerns, and that individual provisions for many sectors are now somewhat less stringent. I believe that sheltered workshops are now well protected; these are an important area, as are the joint purchasing bodies that more and more Member States are setting up, and, of course, all those provisions – particularly in view of enlargement, to which the rapporteur referred – that can be said to clarify the application of the locally-applicable provisions on labour law, social security, taxation and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure gave attention to, and was speedily able to resolve, the issue of national legislation on the award of contracts, which must, in future, be accessible on a website. The Internet is an important source of information for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and it is intended that it should facilitate more cross-border transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to award criteria, which were without doubt the stumbling-block right up to the end of the conciliation procedure, and I find the result that we have achieved perfectly acceptable. We have secured the position of the case-law of the European Court of Justice, which has developed over a lengthy period of time. What we learned from Helsinki – and, thank heaven, on later occasions – has now been incorporated into law. I see this as very important, particularly in terms of legal certainty, and perhaps this legislative package expresses to some degree the value we attach to the case-law of the ECJ in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it only remains to me to appeal to the Member States to transpose this directive without delay and to do so in line with the new conception of it in order to create a real internal market for public-sector contracts, for more competition, and more transparency, but also for advances in the fields of environmental and social policy.</p>

When we consider the outcome and what we were aiming for, our assessment is that we wish in every respect to recommend what has emerged. Firstly, we succeeded, at the previous readings, in averting an increase in the threshold values that would have significantly limited the scope of this directive. That is something we are really pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think we have achieved secure and modern tendering methods. I believe that, as previous speakers have said, we can now go in both for providing more information to businesses on the Internet and for enabling small businesses more easily to find out which rules apply. This will play a part in our successfully helping the administrations to modernise. I believe that this is very important now that we are talking about a competitive Europe. Our objective is to increase the number of cross-border tenders. When we began the debate, we were sometimes concerned about the reports we received at the time to the effect that there were so extremely few cross-border tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur in the Conciliation Committee, Mrs Cederschiöld, whom I had wanted to thank for her constructive work, mentioned that transparency had increased significantly. I believe that what the Conciliation Committee has arrived at, and which really is closer to the Liberal idea, is what the majority signed up to at second reading. It is important for competitors also to be able to see the final outcome of a tendering procedure and to be able to judge whether any errors have been made. That is what is most important in the fight against corruption and in the interests of greater value for money<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the issue of the social and environmental criteria has been much to the fore in this debate. We can now observe that the Commission has also prepared an action plan for modern environmental engineering. I really do believe that the final outcome we arrived at is a tool in this context too. We must not be afraid of modern environmental technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that, following our last conciliation meeting, the Finnish press said that the case of Concordia Bus Finland, brought before the EC Court of Justice and relating to bus traffic in Helsinki, had led to a sound directive on public procurement. I was somewhat irritated about this, because no buses operate without drivers. I want to thank all the drivers who contributed to this end result, and I note that we have steered the matter into a safe harbour.</p>
<p class="contents">My special thanks are due both to the Commissioner and his colleagues, who said just the right words at the right time, and to the Conciliation Committee’s secretariat for its quite excellent work. We have worked on this matter for many years, and it feels as though we have reached a conclusion. I hope it will help our administrations get greater value for money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would take the liberty of providing a short résumé.</p>
<p class="contents">Viewed in a Green perspective, the Commission’s original proposal was completely unacceptable when it came to environmental and social criteria in the case of public procurement. I was, however, very optimistic about the procurement directives once a majority of the European Parliament, at both first and second readings, had strongly supported the proposal to give the procuring parties greater freedom and legal entitlement to take account of, and incorporate, environmental and social criteria in public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I saw from the very beginning that the Commission did not really want to acknowledge the fact that Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty, together with the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and other policy documents, clearly state that environmental and social considerations must be incorporated into all EU policy and that public procurement must be used to achieve the objective of sustainable development. The outcome of the conciliation is quite clearly better than the Commission’s original proposal and the old rules, but I think that we have unfortunately missed a unique opportunity to be as progressive as the pledges and the talk of sustainable development would seem to require.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council has demonstrated a stronger will and greater flexibility, for example through raising the threshold value. I nonetheless believe that, during the conciliation, there was a failure to resolve the important issue arising from the fact that, with a value of 14% of GDP, public procurement really could make a difference to the EU’s environmental policy and promote ‘green’ procurement. I would thank my fellow MEPs, who fought hard for this during the conciliation negotiations. The criteria said to be of an environmental character are among those that, according to the agreed wording, must be set by the procuring entity. This term does not, however, include the methods through which goods are manufactured. Nor does it include the life cycle perspective, that is to say the period from the manufacture of the goods to their becoming waste. Nor does it include the long-term effects, nor the internationalisation of the external costs.</p>
<p class="contents">What, therefore, is meant by criteria of an environmental character? Will not a discussion arise concerning the interpretation and implications of the term and, as a concomitant of this, legal uncertainty too? I think we have missed a brilliant opportunity to promote sustainable development and an improved quality of life for the present, and future, generations. This was also the reason why the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted ‘no’ in the Conciliation Committee’s final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that many members of the Greens/ALE Group will in any case vote in favour of the proposal. That is what I myself am going to do. Despite these criticisms I have made, I naturally hope that the package of draft legislation will promote open and free procurement and also, when all is said and done, still promote environmental and social considerations in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Zappalà has been the main driver on this issue, but it has been a pleasure to work with many colleagues. I also want to pay tribute to Mrs Cederschiöld for her wise leadership that has enabled us to arrive at a very satisfactory outcome to this conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move forward. The Commissioner gave a very powerful presentation about how important these reform directives are to the completion of the internal market. They now have to work in practice. One of the areas we worked on in this conciliation was that of measures that will encourage Member States to get these directives to work properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I make no apologies for repeating what I said in my speech at first reading: we know that there are far too many contracts in all areas of public procurement that are not being properly put onto the Official Journal system. Essentially, governments are allowing their public authorities to evade the provisions of the public procurement system. We know from good practice in a number of Member States, of which Sweden is probably regarded as the best example, that where governments take this seriously, the provisions start to work effectively. Examples include setting up independent bodies to advise all the public agencies in the country concerned on how to work with the public procurement directives. We need to make sure that this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on the point made by Mrs Schörling on behalf of her colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group, and by others, that the contractual terms clearly have to include factors other than economic criteria – as we have seen from the famous Helsinki bus case. In terms of social and economic criteria this must be done in an open and non-discriminatory way as part of the published tender. That was the point we secured in conciliation and I think we arrived at a sensible agreement. This will be part of the new reform procedures that have to go out there and have to work for the sake of delivering and eventually completing the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also say that I am very satisfied with the outcome that we have reached, although – like everyone else – we would obviously have liked to achieve more. Nonetheless, we have achieved a great deal, and as a Social Democrat, I must also make the point that we have also obtained the endorsement of both the Commission and the Council. It is very positive, in my view, that we have managed to establish these criteria – as regards sustainability, environmental and social award criteria, and, for example, the special provisions for people with disabilities – and ultimately managed to secure the approval of the Commission and the Council. I think we can proceed very satisfactorily on this basis. Yes, we would have liked to achieve more in this area, but we have at least established these criteria as a means of exercising control in the contract award procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus ensured that it will not always be the cheapest tender that is awarded the contract, but the most favourable. As Mr Zappalà has said very clearly, the most favourable is not necessarily the cheapest, for quality is important as well. We have achieved something more in this context, something I felt was very important and have repeatedly mentioned. By ensuring that the public sector has the option of deciding for itself which criteria, if any, it wishes to apply to the contract award procedure, we have strengthened the hand of local authorities. In this way, a certain measure of freedom has been maintained for the public sector in the regions and at local level, which these authorities need to be able to implement their own economic policies, and I think that this is a positive achievement. I would like to thank Mrs Berger again for her very good work. We have secured a positive outcome and we can vote for it with a clear conscience, even though, as I said, it would have been good to have achieved more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Zappalà pointed out, we were not always in agreement, but we did eventually reach a decision. These two directives are a step forward – not a huge step, as Mrs Schörling said, but at least some progress has been made. Comparing what was there originally with what we have today shows considerable progress. But why is this?</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked tonight about the huge market involved in the whole area of public procurement. The Commissioner himself mentioned the huge figures involved. But too often when we talk about that market and about public procurement we talk purely about an economic market. These two directives change all that: social and environmental criteria have now been introduced. This means that the tendering authority does not have to accept the lowest tender. Tendering authorities can also take into account recent case-law and I am glad that the Commissioner highlighted the 4 December judgment. We also have the July court decision on the Altmark bus case and, as Mrs Thors pointed out, the Helsinki bus case.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has added a social dimension to economic legislation. We must never forget that while we strive for a competitive economy by 2010, this has to be accompanied by social progress. That is why I will support tomorrow's vote: even though I voted against this conciliation I will actually now vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, though, I compare the speeches that have been made here, I have the impression that the ship has come into several different harbours. I would like to share my own image of this harbour with you. Initially, it is true, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did reject the common position. We take the view, however, that a number of substantial improvements have been achieved in the conciliation process, bringing the compromise more into line with our ideas, so that we can now vote for the outcome at third reading. In my view, these improvements lie primarily in the fact that this compromise proposal has a far more market-oriented focus than was the case even with the common position. The progress on liberalising public procurement through the internal market is maintained and, indeed, built on. We were worried that through the overemphasis on environmental and social criteria, the internal market would be rolled back compared with the position achieved in 1993. Thanks to Mrs Cederschiöld’s inspired leadership, but also due to the very substantial support from the Commission, this threat has been averted, so we can now vote in favour of this compromise result.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not achieved all that we set out to achieve. The proposal still contains a number of very bureaucratic rules, some highly complex regulations and obscure phrasing. It is therefore not entirely in line with what we wanted in terms of better legislation. Nonetheless, I think it is also a step towards reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, and I am pleased that the Commission in particular has made such a substantial contribution, which we see lacking in the context of some other legislative proposals. I would like to thank everyone for the very positive cooperation. It is nice to be able to finish something that we started in this legislative term, and so we will all breathe a sigh of relief when we leave the Chamber today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am of course particularly pleased that these regulations make it possible for those who procure contracts also to use criteria other than price. I think it is important for us to use public procurement in order also to affect the development of society. We must favour products and manufacturers that, from a social point of view, operate along the lines we advocate.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental issues are central. If we wish to reduce food contamination and pollution of the external environment, we must favour manufacturers who have that approach. If we want to see gender equality in working life, we must favour workplaces where this is promoted. If we want everyone to have job opportunities and to be able to support themselves, we must of course favour companies that create jobs for people with disabilities. If we wish to bring about a fairer society that provides greater opportunity for participation, we must ensure that society is designed along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be wondered whether we could have achieved more during the conciliation negotiations. That is a question that negotiators always ask themselves. Having devoted most of my adult life to negotiating, I know that, in negotiations, a point must be reached at which the parties agree. When that point has been reached, as I think it was in our own negotiations, it has to be acknowledged that the time has come to present the result. I think that the result we have presented in our decision is something we can defend and, in actual fact, be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s position on public procurement shows that decisions at Community level can be important for achieving a more humane society. It is an encouraging decision following a time-consuming and, at times, arduous piece of work. I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say a few things in response to Mrs Schörling on the issue of production methods. I should like to reassure her about the findings of the European Court of Justice. In its ruling of 4 December 2003, the Court confirmed and repeated its finding in the famous Helsinki bus case, namely that a requirement, according to which the energy to be supplied must be produced from renewable sources, is, <span class="italic">per se</span>, admissible. The Court added that such an award criterion may be given a high importance, and in this case the relative weight was 45%.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, and to reassure Mrs Schörling, the judgment confirms that, both under current law and under the joint text, production methods are legitimate award criteria and may be given quite a high weight provided always that the criterion is formulated and applied in such a way as to meet the four requirements set out explicitly in both the Helsinki case and in recital 1 of the joint text.</p>
<p class="contents">I should once again like to express the thanks of the Commission that, as one Member said, work on this important file has been concluded within this legislature. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, the shadow-rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, and all who have contributed. I will end by thanking Mr Miller for agreeing, in the end, to support the proposal, even though he voted against it in the Conciliation Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
