<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Segni (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, tomorrow I am going to vote for the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report. The Committee for Constitutional Affairs has done a good job and has taken a progressive, courageous position on certain areas of reform of the Treaties. However, if I were asked to give my opinion on the overall status of the situation in Europe, I would have to say that I am somewhat confused and concerned. There is no point in trying to deny anything. Certain facts which have become clear in the last few days, some of which have been the subject of furious political debate in recent weeks, show that, in actual fact, much of the confusion and fear that has been expressed and many of the objections raised are well-founded.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, a few days ago, <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span> published a revealing article by Mr Schmidt and Mr Giscard d’Estaing, the founders of the European monetary serpent, which frankly and explicitly repeated an observation previously made by Jacques Delors, to the effect that if the institutions do not undergo thorough reform, the European Community will rapidly be reduced to a free trade area. </p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I find some of the decisions adopted extremely excessive, if not rash, such as, for example, the proposal to open the Community to Turkey – a country which I respect and which it is right to respect, despite its differences from the European Community in terms of history, culture and politics and the concept of the State as well, quite apart from the issue of human rights – and these decisions are evidence of an organisation which is becoming increasingly more economic than political. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two alternatives: either the founding countries of the Community change direction, or else, slowly but surely, we will be forced to abandon all hope. There is no longer even any question of the creation of a different State; it is history which must change course. The Europe which we Europeanists dream of is a Europe of States, and it should therefore be no cause for concern to anyone who, and rightly so, believes strongly in national identity. Nobody wants to eliminate the States: however, all these different national situations in the different States, which have reached the point where they are incapable of overcoming the challenges of the world today, must be adapted and tuned to something greater. </p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to touch on the vicious attacks on President Prodi, not only from the press but also within the political sphere. There is no point in denying anything in this case either. I am not passing judgement on President Prodi now, for it would not be appropriate to do so at this time, but I do feel that these attacks are evidence of strong criticism of a Commission line, a line which has been progressive and open. It has sometimes been a little on the optimistic side, but it certainly represents progress. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the fact that I am addressing Commissioner Barnier in this Chamber, with whom I have often had the opportunity for discussion in smaller meetings, gives me a positive feeling about tomorrow’s debate, but my view of the medium- and long-term progress of European development is pessimistic. I feel that Parliament will be required to take courageous, decisive action in matters much more important than a resolution, if, as I fear, the agenda is not extended, and if, in the end, as the current state of affairs would suggest, an excess of caution results in a Conference which makes nothing more than cosmetic changes to the Treaties and avoids any substantial modifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will thereby be a medium-term financial plan which will be agreed between Parliament and the Council. This integration will create much more stability, as well as the legal certainty which Mr Colom i Naval, the permanent rapporteur for the financial perspectives, spoke of this morning. Let us remember that the financial perspectives procedure has brought budgetary stability to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Parliament believes that the integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will mean that, as well as stability, there will be sufficient flexibility to allow for a review of those perspectives when necessary. If we do not do this, we will run the risk of confusing the financial perspectives with the annual budgets. This confusion will lead to conflict year after year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the classification of expenditure, which this House has also long wanted to see, we must find an institutional point of balance which combines the European Parliament’s requests for a greater degree of codecision in budgetary matters with the defence of the privileged nature of certain expenditure which forms the basis of the European Union’s economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament wants the Community budget to be financed by own resources rather than by contributions from the Member States. The fiscal and budgetary autonomy of the European Union rests on this, as does, to a certain extent, its political autonomy. However, let us remember that, if what we want is an autonomous financial system for the Union, we must at the same time create a fair tax system. Progressiveness cannot only be based on expenditure. Sooner or later we will have to be sufficiently progressive in terms of own resources as a basis for this fair tax system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the very least, the two rapporteurs should have been present during the debate on their reports. I am aware that these days are extremely tiring for all concerned, but duty comes before everything else. </p>
<p class="contents">I listened to Mr Segni’s speech. Somewhat aided by the fact that he was speaking in Italian, I realised that he was not speaking on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, whose views are completely different from those he expressed and which I share. We are on the brink of an historic occasion where the risks are great, but so are the opportunities. We must be aware that this historic occasion provides us with the opportunity to enlarge a community of values and not merely orchestrate the geographical and territorial enlargement of an advanced economy which has raised the standard of living of our communities. This is the real challenge. Enlargement is thus our opportunity to change our operating rules and ensure that they are based on greater transparency and stronger guarantees of the rights of citizenship, and also streamline our decision-making. The basic requirement we uphold is the need to confine unanimity to constitutional issues and to use qualified majority voting for all other matters. </p>
<p class="contents">In the very short space of time remaining, I would like to refer to paragraph 51, which puts forward the idea of our coming together with the national parliaments to examine the possibility of holding an Inter-Parliamentary Conference on the future strategies of the Union. Clearly, a substantial amount of responsibility would fall to our President and to the French Presidency. I am convinced that this opportunity for representatives of the national parliaments of both the Union countries and the candidate countries to meet and discuss future strategies and the implications of the Intergovernmental Conference is extremely valuable and must not be passed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an excellent resolution on the table which refers to the many necessary reforms. Indeed, majority decision-making as a rule and reinforcement of the Commission and the European Parliament are essential in order for the enlarged Union to function. Cooperation should be more flexible and each Member State must retain a Commissioner. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the many sound proposals from Parliament are at odds with the willingness of the governments to extend the IGC agenda and reach compromises. If the European governments do not change their attitudes soon, a treaty will be drawn up in Nice which guarantees to cripple the Union once it has been enlarged. Over the past few years, many European government leaders have presented their own people with the view that the European Union is becoming too powerful and too bureaucratic and is taking away too much national sovereignty. They have contributed to a climate of Euroscepticism where there is no room for compromise. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the same politicians have decided in favour of a substantial enlargement, necessitating reforms which were declared taboo in the first place. As such, many European politicians are hostage to their own rhetoric. If the European government leaders are serious about new countries joining, they must display the necessary political courage and agree to far-reaching reforms. We are the representatives of the people. If the governments manage to narrow the gulf between themselves and Parliament, they will ultimately be able to narrow the gulf between themselves and their own people and, at the end of the day, this is what matters.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First number: 700. Limiting the number of Members of the European Parliament to 700 would not be a cause for concern were it not that it would render our Parliament less representative. By marginalising small countries, while at the same time allowing high electoral thresholds to be set up in the largest ones, this sordid electoral mechanism would prevent whole sections of European society from being represented any more in this Chamber. We must reaffirm that it is our Parliament’s prime and absolute task to represent the people and the peoples of Europe in all their diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Second number: two thirds. Two thirds of the vote is the majority required for our Parliament to censure the Commission. This very high threshold of two thirds is a sad and unique case. For what European government can boast of being so safe from any real parliamentary control, of having such impunity? We must create a formal symmetry. If a simple majority is good enough for the investment of the Commission, then the same majority should suffice for a vote of no confidence. The people’s representatives have the power to undo anything they have done. That is the rule everywhere, and it must be the rule here too.</p>
<p class="contents">Third and last number: 2009. The report proposes the year 2009 as the date for electing MEPs from transnational lists. Now this is a case of either or: either our Parliament decides this measure is not a good one, which would mean abandoning it – even in 2009 – or, like the Greens, it must admit that such lists are vital if we want to create real families of thought in Europe, in which case this important political debate can begin by the time of the 2004 elections. Otherwise we would be being neither lucid nor ambitious enough.</p>

Over the centuries many attempts were made by some countries to dominate others. Ideas may have varied according to the times and individual countries’ interests, but the system stayed the same, with power for some and subjugation for others. We suffered centuries of war and even destruction and ruin on several occasions. Many times we had to start over and it was the last time this happened that the European idea came into being. So what is different? The answer is everything. We have a system based on mutual freedom for everyone, instead of supremacy for some. We have a framework agreed between nations and not one imposed on the nations. We therefore have a permanent contract between free and sovereign states which are all equal. Instead of changing majorities, we have the rules of a stable contract in which we are all minorities. This is the secret of the unequalled peace and progress which we have enjoyed, based firstly on a common culture of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and free markets and, secondly, on strict mutual respect with no trampling over other countries. The instruments which we use are procedural rules, unanimity or at least broad convergence, and substantive rules, concrete harmonisation policies and the promotion of economic and social cohesion. The price is patience, which is a small price to pay for such great results!</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be patient with each other and in terms of time so that Europe can continue along the same lines. We particularly need to resist the age-old temptation of wanting to impose ourselves on others, to break this contract between equals, for this has never led to union. By cherishing the idea of union in Europe we are being realistic, not imposing a rose-tinted fantasy. It would be wrong to strip away the rules of the game which have brought us so much success to date.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the motion for a resolution is a dangerous anti-Europe deviation, which completely alters the balance. This would be a disaster for my own country, Portugal, as for other smaller or medium-sized Member States. For Europe in general it would mean a crisis or breakdown. We cannot have a Europe in which less rules over more, which gets annoyed but does not listen and which aims to replace a Treaty between states with a constitution imposed on the states. We want an open Europe, not one tied in a straitjacket.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must mention the idea of transnational European parties. As a Conservative Christian Democrat, I stand as a witness against this. My party, the Popular Party or CDS-PP, founded the PPE. Some years ago we were expelled from the PPE because we advocated a referendum on Maastricht. It is now our former Austrian companions from the Christian Democratic Union who are in difficulty because of elections in their country. What a frightening idea of democracy! We need to be careful, for federalism is so dazzling that it destroys with its hands those concepts which it asserts with its own mouth. This is because it covets power and ignores partnership and we cannot go down this road.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When I hear the ongoing debate and consider how much opposition there has been from the Council over the past few months, some members of which are barely prepared to go beyond the three “leftovers”, then I think it is hypocritical to conduct negotiations with the candidate countries at the same time. Today’s statement by President-in-Office of the Council Gama has inspired me with a little more confidence, but I still see no evidence of political will on the part of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Our goal must be to equip our parliamentary representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference with a clear negotiating brief, which we will then also use as a yardstick for assessing the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference. In my view, it is crucial that we set down a clear marker for the proportional composition of a future European Parliament, subject to an upper limit of 700 Members. Extending majority voting in the Council must lead to codecision rights for the European Parliament. The Council must have open meetings when it takes on the role of legislator. We need to clearly distinguish between competences at European and national level without delay.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The self-inflicted crisis in the Council is a matter of deep regret to me. I would like to ask the Council how it proposes to pull off the stroke of excluding a certain Member State from taking part in discussions without any legal basis, when it needs this State’s support in order to achieve unanimity in the Council on Treaty amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot support the proposal in recital 29 of the report to make the procedure for suspending a Member State easier. How I vote at tomorrow’s vote on this resolution will depend on the outcome of the vote on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important consideration regarding enlargement in the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report is increased flexibility. Only differentiation within the EU can create the preconditions necessary for enlargement on such a massive scale.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the report proposes that closer cooperation should be facilitated. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has recommended that the principle of flexibility should also be realised in the form of greater scope for cooperation for those countries that cannot or do not want to accept the Union’s statutes in their entirety. This would facilitate and speed up enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In making its review the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party states that flexibility might lead to a larger concentric Europe, composed of a federal core and a less integrated outer circle. At this stage it is not necessary to adopt a precise position on how the Union should be differentiated. It is enough for now that we create an institutional framework in which it is possible to deepen and expand the Union in practical terms. I hope that Amendment No 154, which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled regarding increased flexibility, will be adopted.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is the exercise before the Union of the powers of the national authorities, federal states and Autonomous Communities not recognised?

Manifestly, the first and main issue is the quality of the decision-making process in the Union. Here we attach the utmost importance to extending the scope of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were certain that tomorrow every decision could be taken by a qualified majority in the European Union, we would not have raised the question of closer cooperation. But we have to acknowledge that undoubtedly we will also need this instrument. That is what this Parliament said when it first stated its position and I think that in a way we have helped persuade the community of Heads of State and Government to listen to our refrain. Of course we can only be delighted at this.</p>
<p class="contents">But today I want to address those MEPs who see, behind this closer cooperation, the risk of too far-reaching consultation between the large countries. It seems to me that at present it is in the interest of all the members of the Union that any closer cooperation within the Union should be established on a basis of respect for the Union’s legal system and institutions. To that end, let us authorise closer cooperation when one third of the Member States takes part or is involved, and let us authorise this closer cooperation by a qualified majority, after obtaining Parliament’s assent. Tomorrow we will certainly have to consider the question of the democratic scrutiny of this closer cooperation, an area where our Parliament will have to play a major role.</p>
<p class="contents">So I understand why the Intergovernmental Conference will look into these questions and I am glad the discussions are thus going to the heart of the matter. But you will find these same questions coming up again in other discussions you will be holding during the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one more point before concluding, Madam President. I want to sound the alarm about the progress in drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights we want to see incorporated in the Treaty. It is most important to incorporate that Charter. At a time when the values of the Union are at times being overturned or seem undermined, that Charter is coming at just the right moment; but it will be meaningful only if it is incorporated in the Treaty and has real substance, based on the Cologne mandate, the entire Cologne mandate, i.e. only if it includes economic and social rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parts of it are clearly crafted as helpful suggestions to the IGC; other parts form a list of pious hopes and hopeful wishes which are certain to be rejected by the Conference. How much of this schizoid quality reflects the positions of the two rapporteurs is hard to estimate. If so, I am sure that I can attribute the better parts to my friend and colleague Mr Dimitrakopoulos and the more unusual parts to Mr Leinen.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the majority of my Conservative colleagues have voted to reject the report and will vote accordingly in this House. The Conservative delegation regards many of the ideas in the report as centralising, syndicalist, unnecessary and backward-looking. Instead of examining new, flexible and radical approaches to an enlarged Union in the global market, the message of this report is: carry on regardless down the road from Maastricht and Amsterdam!</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in rejecting this report the Conservative delegation shows it too has a schizophrenic quality, since it therefore rejects the excellent amendment by Mr Duff, to give a legal opt-out to Member States, and that of my friend Mr Perry and others, to enable Parliament to put public money where its mouth is by saving wasteful expenditure entailed in the absurdity of these Strasbourg sessions. That is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions.

<p class="contents">Firstly, to generalise the system of dual simple majority voting is not the panacea of the future integration of Europe. A principle of that kind could induce public opinion in the Member States and the national parliaments to reject that system for the most sensitive issues which are in fact exceptions to the general rule. It would be better to seek a compromise acceptable to all, as in the past. It is a question of legitimacy and acceptability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Member States with a large population get more than their fair share. The underlying principle of “one man – one vote” is unacceptable. It conflicts with Article 190 of the Treaty which provides that the number of elected Members must ensure the appropriate representation of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community. It is a question of equality and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is no serious argument to back up the thesis we keep being served up, namely that a Commission of more than 20 members would not work.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, in the case of the Commission, let us avoid making numbers into an absolute principle. On the contrary, if we want decisions proposed on the Commission’s initiative to gain wide support in all the Member States, it is vital for them all to be represented. The important vote we will be holding tomorrow will, I hope, enable the European Parliament to put an end to this ambiguity and to make some adjustments. Only a more politically realistic proposal will have a chance of being taken into consideration. IGC 2000 is not the end of the story. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all agree today that we must adopt institutional and political reforms prior to any enlargement of the Union. That is the challenge we have to meet at a moment when many of our fellow-citizens are beginning to feel doubts and see few political prospects. Today the European Union which the founding fathers conceived, achieved and then bequeathed to us must evolve and change. Europe is at a crossroads. Either we content ourselves in future with being merely a free trade area, or we seek to construct a political Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">But let us make no mistake: if we choose to sit on the fence, we are likely to see the worst scenario. A Europe with a single currency, but without its attributes of political power, would revert to being merely a geographical area, which would give free rein to national rivalries. The time has come for Europe to be a power capable of genuine political expression, of sustaining a social project and framing a common foreign and defence policy. It is up to us, the elected representatives of the people of Europe, to work towards improving the efficiency and democracy of our institutions. </p>
<p class="contents">But Europe will only be democratic if the people themselves determine the principles and rules of its organisation. I am happy that the Dimitrakopoulos report takes this aspiration into account in the framework of a constitutional process aimed at simplifying and clarifying the Community treaties. But I think we need to go further; we need a constitution, i.e. a basic law, so that Europe can assert itself as a genuine democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the reform of the institutions is not only the condition for enlargement, it is also the condition for the survival of Europe. Commissioner, I hope the representatives of the Member States will embark on real reforms and take the measure of the issues at stake in the Intergovernmental Conference, so as to make this century into the century of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Long before the IGC was launched, the Dutch social democratic delegation had already taken an active interest in the IGC. We have held large public debates in the Netherlands and have done a great deal of groundwork. After all, the IGC should prepare the Union for enlargement, and this enlargement will require the current Member States to make sacrifices. These sacrifices, however, are small, given the historic opportunity of unifying the East and the West in a secure Europe characterised by peace. In addition, it should, of course, bring Europe closer to its citizens, because the distance between Brussels and our citizens is still far too great. The IGC should therefore make up the democratic shortfall. For this purpose, it is essential to extend majority decision-making to all legislation, except for constitutional matters, and have codecision power for Parliament, as well as the well-known double formula in the Council decision-making process. Simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen. This is why we have specifically committed ourselves to a better and institutionalised social dialogue with non-governmental organisations, since they look after many of the citizens’ interests. This is provided for in Amendment No 162.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject which is close to our hearts is that of making closer cooperation more flexible. It is clear that the de facto veto, currently inherent in this procedure, must go. Once enlargement has taken place, closer cooperation could do a great service to a Union containing a still greater diversity of Member States within its borders. In our opinion, the report does not go far enough regarding another point, namely that relating to individual responsibility which must be granted by Commissioners. We firmly believe that it must be possible for Parliament to issue a strong warning to a Commissioner who loses the confidence of Parliament. In our opinion, such a procedure does more justice to a democratic balance between the institutions than the Prodi procedure, but unfortunately, the majority of MEPs considered this step a bridge too far. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, with regard to our Euro-Commissioner, we would ideally like to have one Commissioner per country. We would accept a rota system for all states at a pinch, because we support the compromise made by the socialist group. We think that, ultimately, our compromise has struck a sound balance between small and large Member States. We hope that this will receive support from this Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a European federal state with a strong centre and far-reaching competences, or should we carefully develop what has so far been the trademark of European integration and a guarantee of its success, namely a Union of Europe’s peoples and States? To read the text of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, you would almost believe that the European federalists have already won the day: a Commission that does not contain representatives from every Member State, a Parliament in which even the representatives of the medium-sized States no longer carry any weight, and a Council that essentially bases its majorities on 51% of the total population of the Member States. This would be a travesty, even for an ardent European.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The text we adopt tomorrow will, I hope, be a different one, a more balanced text that is geared to continuing teamwork between large and small States, and which continues to respect the distinguishing features of our European peoples and States, and therefore does not make even more demands of the citizens of Europe, who have enough problems with the degree of centralisation in Brussels as it is. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I am hoping for a change to the Committee’s text. Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen put forward a proposal in recital 29 to modify the procedure for suspending a Member State in the event of serious democratic and human rights violations. Allow me to leave you in no doubt as to how the vast majority of people in my country, Austria that is, feel about such a development. They are already learning, from bitter experience, what it is like when Community law in force is not adhered to, in the name of political correctness. This does nothing to boost confidence in the central tenet of a united Europe. A community of law must uphold its own law.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is simply not true that the policies adopted towards Austria at present are only bilateral in nature. Anyone still requiring confirmation of this fact need look no further than the speech made today by the President of this House. How else are we to interpret Nicole Fontaine’s statement to the effect that she hopes that Austria will become a full member of the Union again one day? What does that make us now? Therefore let us dispense with hypocritical amendments to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty. Let us abide by the law in force and handle the Austrians as required by the EU Treaty. Inclusion, and not exclusion, is what we need! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore find a way of cooperating throughout Europe. The accession negotiations are now under way. It is therefore important that it should be possible to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference before the end of the year. Both large and small States must be able to exercise influence in the future EU. We must strike a balance. This is necessary if our citizens are to have confidence in European cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">If the composition of the European Parliament is to be adjusted, I therefore advocate a proportional, degressive reduction in the number of Members. All present Member States must be included and make their contribution. At the same time, the smallest States must be guaranteed a certain number of Members within the framework of the seven hundred seats we have set as a ceiling. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to votes in the Council, we must find a method of distributing votes which does not need to be renegotiated at each subsequent enlargement. I therefore recommend a system which takes account of differences in the size of the population. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that each country should have a Member in the Commission. The Commissioners work for the whole of the Union and are, in fact, important if consensus is to be achieved between the Member States. The Commission must therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">EU cooperation is, in the first place, a civil European project and ought to be distinguished from anything of a military nature. The Member States do have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned. In Cologne and Helsinki, great progress was made in terms of preparing ourselves for preventative crisis and conflict management. It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civil and military cooperation. A European military alliance should not, therefore, be created within the framework of the EU’s institutions but between individual States. Military support of a kind which places States under an obligation to each other has no place in the EU’s Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now also at the top of the agenda prior to the Swedish Presidency. We do not, however, want to see European cooperation cease or degenerate into bickering, which would be a risk if 30 countries could constantly use their vetoes. </p>
<p class="contents">Development of the Union can only seriously be accorded priority through also, at the same time, welcoming qualified majority voting in the majority of areas but excluding, for example, the area of new treaties. We also want to see majority decision-making in regard to Article 289, because it would then be possible, where the European Parliament’s headquarters and meetings are concerned, to establish rules which would prevent the waste of human resources and tax revenue. Swedish taxpayers, who also pay net amounts into the European Union, are in fact at a loss to understand the madness of travelling backwards and forwards with thousands of cases every month. Perhaps it would be more efficient to have the offices in a pan-European caravan than to waste all these man-months, as we now do, upon plane journeys. We have every respect for symbols of peace, but the billions spent on gadding off to Strasbourg could, of course, be spent instead on our neighbours in the East, who perhaps have more use for these “peace billions” than we do. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank the rapporteurs for a very good report and to express my hope that the Citizens’ Charter will usher in the new Treaty. I also want to end by expressing special thanks to Commissioner Barnier for being present throughout the debate and for his commitment to these issues. In fact, he gives me hope and inspiration on many occasions when I think that the Member States are being both negative and unreasonable on a whole range of issues with which, as European citizens, we really have problems. I would thank you, Commissioner Barnier, for your efforts which in fact help me to take an optimistic view of Europe’s future development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to find answers to the challenge of enlargement, but the Union at its present size also needs to re-establish the rules of the game and the decision-making process. We have to strike a balance between efficiency, democracy and Member State equality. Above all, we have to be able to restore confidence of our citizens in decision making in the European Union. This will come about by increasing genuine transparency and by developing the way administration actually serves the people. The Commission must be given support while it puts the changes into effect, but the Council and Parliament must also themselves be able to work to strengthen confidence among our citizens. Both an enlarged Union, and one that is the present size, must ensure that decision making is mainly in the form of qualified majority decisions. We have seen that matters of taxation, for example, have become stumbling blocks. It is hard to understand why we cannot introduce a reasonable tax on capital in Europe. At present, capital is like a dog off its leash.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have a lot to gain and protect in a common Europe. We also have to cling to the notion of European solidarity for as long as possible in changing circumstances. I cannot accept the idea that closer cooperation can be achieved on the strength of the vote of one third of the Member States. In my opinion, we need more than that. The Commission should also be as thorough as possible in the way it drafts topics for debate, and this is why in future there should also be a Commission Member representing each Member State. The balance between the small and the large Member States must also be preserved in the Council so that double majority voting can never be acceptable under any circumstances.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact 12 Members voted for and 12 voted against. Of the latter, 8 voted against and 4 abstained. That is not something to be proud of. But I find it reassuring that so many Members agreed that the length of the shopping list of proposals contained in the report’s 52 paragraphs and 58 sub-paragraphs is exaggerated and that, as things stand, there is a risk that the Intergovernmental Conference will not take it seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">But unlike Talleyrand, I cannot console myself with the idea that what is exaggerated is by the same token insignificant. I want to dissociate myself from demands such as that we should cut my country’s delegation in the European Parliament by one third. I know that by head of population the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has more representatives here than the large countries, but that is a primitive and premature method of calculation. With 6 Members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country. Moreover, we cannot sit on all the committees. It is easier to divide up the work and to specialise in a large delegation: even if the largest delegation, comprising 99 Members, was reduced by a third, they would still be able to share out the work. For the time being, it is enough to propose that the seats in the European Parliament should be allotted on the basis of a degressive proportional system, with a minimum number of seats per Member State, while of course respecting Article 190 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of European lists is premature, if not hare-brained. There can be no question of a majority of MEPs deciding the location of the seat of this Parliament here, against the views of the others: we must respect the Edinburgh compromise. In the case of a qualified-majority Council decision, it is inconceivable to provide for a simple majority of Member States. We must have a majority of two thirds of the Member States, even if that means providing at the same time for a simple majority of Member States representing a majority of the total EU population. There can be no question of restricting unanimous Council voting to decisions of a constitutional nature. We must also retain majority voting for fundamental questions, such as own resources, taxation and so forth. I hope the idea of not allocating one Commissioner to each Member State is well and truly dead. Finally, if we really need closer cooperation, it must involve at least half of the Member States, otherwise we risk ending up with something like the French Directory.</p>
<p class="contents">This document contains other incongruities too, especially in relation to the budget, which fortunately have no chance of success in the Council and even less chance of being ratified by national parliaments that have any self-respect. I will not vote for this shopping list unless it is amended along the lines I have just set out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that our report is more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be argued that this report is less serious when it proposes exactly what we need? It speaks of constitutionalising the European Union, it proposes suitable changes for its institutions, it requests an extension of policies and, above all, through its proposals, it tries to put the Union in a position to confront such important challenges as, firstly, globalisation and, secondly, the new economy which we have just discussed in Lisbon.</p>

They are consistent with what this Parliament has always demanded: more democracy and efficiency for the European Union. Furthermore, in this respect, I believe that the effort of the rapporteurs in drawing up the original draft and seeking a compromise through the amendments will lead to a position which should be taken into account by this Parliament and by the national governments.</p>

This is why the debate caused by the presentation of the European Parliament’s position on this promising Intergovernmental Conference is vital in understanding this new phase of European construction which is both risky and open to question. We are pleased that this contribution from Parliament stresses, as the main themes and guiding principles, the democratisation, efficiency and greater supervision of the European institutions, exactly where the respective deficits have been most felt and where the risks of disintegration, caused by the significant increase in the number of Member States, were greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the majority of the proposals aim to enable and reinforce the joint progress and the integration process in this new and complex framework, and these are to be applauded, there are others which are not so great. I am specifically referring to the European lists for this Parliament or to the rules on decisions by qualified majority or on closer cooperation, for example, in which a fairer balance between the Member States, more in accordance with the representation and legitimacy of the respective bodies, could be attempted. We fortunately have the opportunity to improve these points tomorrow in plenary. As for the countries which were for years subjected to forced and authoritarian integration and which are now knocking on our door, attracted by the success of our joint experiment, we must receive them with our house in order and operating properly. There must also be no doubt about everyone’s participation in the search for the best solutions for all and about the primacy of the values of justice, democracy and solidarity within these countries.

I wonder why, as a committed Europhile, I find myself disagreeing in this debate with many other committed Europhiles and specifically the rapporteurs. In my opinion, the grounding of the European project in the dual legitimacy of a union of peoples and a union of States is not reflected in the end result of this report’s proposals. At a time when the European Parliament should be achieving a consensus which could act as an important reference, politically speaking, for the Intergovernmental Conference, our position is cause for regret. We hope that certain amendments will be approved tomorrow. These are essential to guarantee a balance between small and large Member States and even between the dual legitimacy of a union of peoples and a union of States. We therefore hope to have reason to vote for this report tomorrow. We will if this House approves a set of just six or seven amendments which we feel are essential to ensure that this issue is considered not from a position of national egoism but from one which defends the coherence and solidarity of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is directed at the President-in-Office. We were puzzled about what Mr Gama said, in his initial intervention, on the current state of the work in the IGC. We are well aware of the Portuguese presidency’s determination. I would therefore like to encourage the presidency to continue working to ensure that the Member States understand how vital it is that more questions are decided by qualified majority and that there is greater flexibility in EU decision-making. I would also encourage you to ensure that the IGC agenda is extended to questions which we regard as essential, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We hope that this can be included in the Treaty as, if so, not only would we be making a significant contribution to the EU’s future but we would also bring ourselves closer to the people at this politically important time. We must now reaffirm once again the community of values which will be enshrined by this Charter of Fundamental Rights. Congratulations, Mr President-in-Office.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful for the many suggestions put forward for the report compiled by myself and Mr Dimitrakopoulos. It is clear that “Operation Intergovernmental Conference” is an extremely difficult one, but I also see that everyone is taking the trouble to reach a compromise, because we must move the European project forward. Parliament must be a driving force in this. Our demands must not be more conservative than those of the European Commission or of individual Member States. That is not on! Our role is to be the driving force behind further European unification, and that is the spirit in which this parliamentary report, which we are to vote on tomorrow, has been compiled. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have struck a balance between Europe of the States and Europe of the citizens. We are the citizens’ chamber; Parliament is the chamber of the citizens, the Council of Ministers is the chamber of the States. We have not struck the right balance yet. After all, Parliament is excluded from a whole range of important issues that parliaments normally decide on; issues pertaining to legislation, the budget, and to codecision concerning the nomination of individuals appointed to institutions. Therefore I hope that this Intergovernmental Conference will use the opportunity to at last restore the balance between the two institutions, Parliament and the Council that is, and to give Parliament more powers.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I too feel that it is extremely important to strike a balance between the large and small countries. This is a very sensitive issue, which we must take into account, and I feel that everyone has endeavoured over the past few weeks to strike this balance. We will see that small and large countries alike will enjoy equal rights where the composition of the Commission is concerned, and that the double majority in the Council, which we are proposing, will favour the small countries. There will be far more small countries than large countries in the enlarged Union. When the support of the majority of the States is required, then the small countries will in fact be very much at an advantage, because it will not be possible to reach any kind of decision unless a large number of them support it. I can also see that we are favouring the small countries in applying the degressivity factor to the distribution of seats in Parliament, so that the number of MEPs is suitably representative.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union is not just an economic community. We are also a community of values. The European Union must also defend itself against forces that are injurious to the European spirit, and that abuse it. We know who the populists are, and the nationalists and the racists who are to be found in many European countries, and if we are a political union then we must also have the instruments we need to implement sanctions and measures, both at party and government level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have an excellent report for voting on tomorrow. I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, which has been most cooperative. I would expressly like to commend them for this. I would also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Barnier, who is always very approachable and cooperative, as I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee and my co-rapporteur. I believe that tomorrow, Parliament will adopt a position that will afford us a prominent role at the Intergovernmental Conference and also lead this European Treaty to success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider this to be the Council’s legitimate right.</p>
<p class="contents">Comments were made about the Council’s absence during the address by the Austrian President to this Parliament. I must say firstly, to clarify matters, that the Council presidency was not supposed to be present nor was this Parliament’s understanding. We did not have any indication from the President of this House that we should attend for what was purely a parliamentary matter. Secondly, I must say that, on questions of political responsibility, the Council refuses to be given lessons and be subjected to pressure by something that has much more to do with the internal chicanery of Portuguese national politics than properly with matters of substance. In my opinion, this House has ended up being used as a kind of platform for political provocation and we will not accept this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear boundary around the work of the Portuguese presidency with regard to the functioning of the institutions and the role of Austria in these institutions. This was totally obvious from my intervention in this House when this issue was first debated. Within the European Union we have met all the requirements allowing Austria to act and participate fully in the European institutions and in their own functioning as a country. We are therefore not confusing any of our positions and we refuse, due to a mere internal political provocation, to consider in this debate issues which have nothing to do with the European Parliament and the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on now to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, I must say firstly that I have the greatest respect for the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. This is a report of great depth and vision but, conceivably, it might not be the subject of consensus in Council, which would allow it to represent a step forward in the enlargement of the Union. However, I must repeat that I have great respect for the work carried out as it provides a certain vision of Europe and of what European ambition must be. I wonder, like everyone else – and we will probably have the opportunity to consider this in more detail during the debate within the IGC – whether the conditions exist within this framework to achieve the ambition expressed in this report, particularly by the deadline. I wonder whether we can close an IGC such as we all want, by the end of this year, with such a high level of ambition in terms of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">This point is very important. This House must also consider, in voting on this report, whether or not the set of proposals which it contains is sufficiently realistic about what can be approved by the end of this Conference. This is regardless of the excellent quality of the proposals, as I have said, and the vision of the future which they provide. We must realise that the European Union, being governed as it is by rules of efficiency, democracy and transparency, must always consider, as stated by Mr Poos, the problem of whether public opinion will systematically accept all the reforms to be made. There are fifteen parliaments to which we must answer and which must ratify this Conference. If one of these fifteen does not ratify the IGC, then we will be faced with a European crisis. I hope that the people will realise that the work we are doing in the IGC is serious, realistic and responsible. We do not want this to become a fatuous exercise which may tomorrow have a negative effect on the whole reason for its existence, namely the expectation that the EU will modernise and reform in order to make it compatible with the future enlargement which may know no bounds.</p>

As I pointed out this morning, they have sought the greatest possible convergence between the Commission and the European Parliament, in order to imbue these negotiations with the political impetus they need. Following on from what Mr Seixas da Costa said, let me also say, and I can testify to this, that these negotiations conducted under the Portuguese Presidency have indeed, as the Portuguese Minister just said, been conducted with great authority, realism and pragmatism. From that point of view, as I had hoped, the Portuguese Presidency has proved itself to be in no way an interim or secondary presidency. It has an extremely important role to play and it really is playing it, in order to make the necessary progress before handing over to the French Presidency. And from that point of view, I want to thank the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate. Firstly, many speakers discussed the question of the equilibrium between what are termed the large and the small states. We are well aware that this equilibrium is both necessary and difficult to achieve. It is necessary because, since 1957, all the states are recognised as equal, as having equal sovereignty; but at the same time it is difficult to achieve because they do not all have the same size of population and because, out of respect for democracy, we must by one means or another take account of the fact that the number of citizens differs from country to country. What I mean to say is that for its part the Commission has sought to establish this equilibrium in the proposals it put forward on 26 January, and which it has defended week after week, as indeed it did on the double majority question. One way of achieving an equilibrium is for qualified-majority voting always to secure the support of at least a majority of states and half the population.</p>
<p class="contents">We even went a little further on an issue which has given rise to much comment and at times to anxiety, namely the Commission. We have gone beyond the search for an equilibrium and proposed an egalitarian solution in relation to the composition of the Commission. And to those who are worried, let me say again that I have seen no sign of any proposal that any Member State should not have a Commissioner. What we proposed, let me repeat, is one Commissioner per Member State, but with two options. I would like you to consider these options carefully, and indeed we have the time to carefully consider the consequences of these options between now and the end of the year. The first option is one Commissioner per Member State on a permanent basis, all sitting at the same time, but with a Commission which will one day have 30 or 35 Commissioners, which will inevitably mean a hierarchy within the College. The second option is a Commission with one Commissioner per Member State, but not all sitting at the same time, which would mean the Commission would remain more collegiate by nature.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, remains our aim: to establish an equilibrium between the small and the large states. In that regard, I share the concerns expressed by a number of speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Second concern: the role of the European Parliament as the driving force, as referred to by Jo Leinen. As I said this morning, I really believe that we, and you, ladies and gentlemen, during your term of office, must spend some time explaining these European issues not just in your constituencies, your countries, but everywhere else too, to all the citizens, and as often as possible. Opportunities must also be created to convince and speak to the national parliaments. President Napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference. At his invitation I myself took part in a meeting between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, where I found a great deal of interest expressed. The Commission will be prepared to take part in any exercise aimed at enhancing this dialogue and this mutual understanding between the national parliaments, which we need in order to ratify a genuine reform, and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I heard Mr Poos say earlier that this IGC 2000 was not the end of the story. Of course we know that history will not stop at the end of the year 2000 and that there will be further institutional changes. But let me state quite emphatically and formally that, after the end of the year, we will not be returning to some of the important issues under consideration during these negotiations. These issues are: the composition of the Commission, the scope of qualified-majority voting, the composition of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice and the voting system. One way or another, these questions will be settled at the end of the year and they will be settled for the long term, the very long term.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must take the time to reflect carefully about what we are doing. There is no way that later, when we have 20, 25 or 30 Member States, we will be able to do what we did not manage to do either in Amsterdam or today, this year, for lack of political will. So I hope that together, working with the Council, we will manage to give a sufficiently strong political impetus so that in the final analysis, at the end of this year, we succeed with these negotiations, rather than merely concluding them, and that together we demonstrate a collective political courage that goes beyond considerations based merely on caution or national interests.</p>
