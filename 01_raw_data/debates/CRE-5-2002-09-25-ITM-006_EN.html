<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Møller,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as may be seen from the agenda, I have been asked to issue a statement today under the heading, ‘The situation concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) following the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (Elsinore, 29 and 30.8.2002)’. I am alert to the fact that the request for this report has to be seen in terms of Parliament’s wish to be kept informed of the EU’s deliberations following the United States’ request for the Member States to enter into bilateral agreements aimed at preventing American citizens from being handed over to the Court. It is quite understandable that Members of the European Parliament should be concerned about this matter, just as they were concerned about the United States’ ASPA legislation (American Service Members’ Protection Act), for it is of crucial importance to us all to insist upon the integrity and effectiveness of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by pointing out that, since the Elsinore meeting, there have been further developments concerning the ICC, and I hope that these will have a more positive and long-term effect on the issues that are at present occupying our friends on the other side of the Atlantic. The first meeting of states participating in the ICC was held in New York from 3 to 10 September.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to be able to report that this general meeting went well. It had been well prepared for by the Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in New York. The present draft documents were finalised thanks to focused and significant contributions from all the delegations in the course of the ten meetings of the Preparatory Commission. We can be pleased that the same productiveness and willingness to compromise were manifested during the ICC’s first general meeting, so that it was possible to adopt the present documents without anyone’s being tempted to re-open the discussion concerning the compromises on which a consensus had previously been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the time has come to focus upon the International Criminal Court’s duties in The Hague. It is now up to diplomats and politicians to give the Court the ability to complete what was begun in Rome and continued in New York. The ICC must establish itself as an effective and independent institution which can accommodate the demands now made by the international community. The Court must exercise its jurisdiction effectively and independently, in the same way that we expect our national legal systems to.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the ICC’s ability to function properly will depend upon no serious obstacles being placed in its way. That, of course, leads me on to the problem that I mentioned to begin with and that presumably also occupies Parliament a great deal, namely the issue of the United States’ request for bilateral agreements on non-extradition.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Presidency has said on previous occasions, the European Union and the United States share the same basic values. We both profess freedom and democracy, accountability to the courts and the defence of human rights and of the principle of a society governed by the rule of law. We have therefore always thought that the United States should be among the participants in the Rome Statute. The United States could make a particularly positive contribution to the Court and to the way it operates. Since 1998, we have tried to accommodate American concerns in relation to certain provisions of the Statute but, as the summer showed, these efforts have been in vain. MEPs will be familiar with the most recent chapter of the story whereby, in a declaration of 6 May of this year, the United States decided that it did not intend to participate in the Statute that it had in fact signed under the Clinton administration. We believe that the United States’ decision is wrong, and the European Union has publicly deplored the step taken by the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not bore MEPs, or extend the sitting, by providing too many details, but I think it might be useful if I were to take this opportunity briefly to put into context the discussion we had in Elsinore concerning the bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States’ request for bilateral agreements was first discussed by the Council in the Political and Security Committee (PSC) on 26 July. There was agreement in the PSC on a provisional common response that the Member States could give to the United States in the course of bilateral contacts. The common response essentially consisted of telling the Americans that the EU remains committed to its obligations to support the ICC and the integrity of the Rome Statute; that the American proposal has far-reaching implications necessitating the more detailed analysis in which we also invited the candidate countries to participate; and that we would come back with an answer as soon as the analysis had been completed. The Political and Security Committee (PSC) decided to return to the matter at the beginning of September once the Council’s experts on international law (COJUR) had discussed the matter on 4 September.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, it was decided that it would be useful to have a short discussion of the matter at the meeting in Elsinore at the end of August. There, we agreed that the EU should not accept anything that might undermine the International Criminal Court. We also agreed that the EU should not increase the difficulties in relation to the United States. Rather, we should look at possible ways of accommodating the United States. We confirmed that the legal experts should examine the matter with a view to arriving at a common assessment which might lead to agreement as to a common and constructive approach on the part of the EU at the Council meeting on 30 September.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves at the end of the period of reflection. At their meeting in New York, the United States and the EU agreed to look into whether we could arrive at a common position. This also meant that the United States was willing to move for, otherwise, there would have been no basis for further analytical work. Some outlines of a common approach are now beginning to emerge, therefore. In EU circles, there is agreement that any solution must take account of relevant agreements already entered into with the United States and must be based upon, and reflect, three fundamental principles if the integrity of the Rome Statute is to be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the present American proposal is irreconcilable with obligations in relation to the International Criminal Court. On the other hand, it is no solution, either, simply to reject the proposal outright for that reason. On the contrary, we are trying, as I stated, to find a policy that can both sustain respect for the Court and ensure that we can come to an arrangement with the United States too.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles underlie the issue of preventing the most serious international crimes from going unpunished, the issue of reciprocity and the issue of the categories of person to whom the arrangements are to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">If a solution is to be found to the issue of exemption from punishment, raised by the American proposal, it will have to contain a suitable provision ruling out exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court. That is to say, there must be no exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of reciprocity, this is not something we want to see. It is unacceptable to arrive at a result that rules out the extradition of citizens of states participating in the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the categories of person to whom the arrangements would be applicable, the United States wants to see a rule that would exclude everyone, and therefore all Americans, from extradition to the ICC. There is agreement in the EU that a solution will only be able to cover specified categories of person from countries not participating in the ICC. The issue of specifying in more detail those to whom the arrangements will apply will continue to be discussed up until 30 September.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that our analysis and deliberations have by no means been concluded. Rather, they are continuing. As recently as yesterday, the Presidency’s legal experts held a meeting with American interlocutors in order to exchange views and information. We shall now work hard to achieve a solution that can, if possible, accommodate the United States’ concerns without in any way undermining the Court. Both through bilateral contacts and at a meeting with the United States’ Secretary of State, Colin Powell, we have, as I mentioned, made it very clear how important it is to us that the spirit and letter of the Rome Statute should be respected. I also said this at the meetings I had on 3 July and again last week in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">In my introductory speech here today, I emphasised that the time has now come for the International Criminal Court to show that it is in a position to function as an effective and independent court. We must hope that the United States can be prevailed upon to adopt a more positive approach once the International Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be exploited for political reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I am very pleased to speak today about the European Commission's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court. I believe, as Parliament does, that the creation of the International Criminal Court represents a critical milestone in the evolution of international human rights law.</p>
<p class="contents">No longer will tyrants gain impunity for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity – including widespread murder of civilians, torture and mass rape – by hiding behind the cloak of national sovereignty. No longer will the international community have to create international criminal tribunals after the fact – after the crimes that we all deplore have already been committed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 21st century, potential tyrants and mass murderers will know in advance that the international community is prepared to hold them accountable for massive violations of human life and dignity. It is our belief and our hope that this awareness will help to reduce the frequency and the severity of such crimes. But when it does not, and the relevant national legal authorities are unwilling or unable to act, the international community will have in place a complementary system of criminal justice that is fair, transparent and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union fully supports the Court. The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the ICC, are fully in line with the principles and objectives of the Union. The consolidation of the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, and as provided for in Article 11 of the EU Treaty, are of fundamental importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We have committed ourselves to the success of the ICC. We have provided funds in projects to support the broadest possible ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute and we have committed more money for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is still real work to be done before the ICC can function as intended. One challenge is to increase the number and broaden the geographical scope of states that have signed and ratified the Rome Statute. As of today, 139 states have signed the Statute, and 81 have ratified it. These numbers are impressive, but need to be increased. We note a particular gap among Asian States. The Commission will continue to make every effort to encourage third countries that have not yet done so to sign and/or ratify the Statute. We will also work with states that have ratified the Statute to ensure the timely adoption of national implementing legislation necessary to cooperate with the Court and to exercise national criminal jurisdiction over crimes covered by the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, of course, the most controversial issue is that of bilateral agreements under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, to which the Presidency referred. The Commission supports the decision taken by the Foreign Ministers at Helsingør to develop an EU response on Article 98 that seeks to accommodate US concerns without in any way undermining the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the details of the European Union position on Article 98 are completed – I hope by the end of this month – we will work with the candidate and EEA States to maintain a united front on the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the longer term, the Commission also supports an ongoing dialogue between the European Union and the United States on the future of the International Criminal Court. An open EU-US dialogue on these matters is critical to the ultimate effectiveness of the Court. We disagree with the United States about the Court. We are sorry that all the reassurances we gave during the negotiations, and subsequently, have been ignored. We are sorry that they have declined to take 'yes' for an answer. So be it. Without any acrimony, but with steady determination, we must get on with the task of making the Court a success.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious challenge in doing that. That is to ensure that the nomination and election of the ICC’s judges and chief prosecutor are fair, transparent and fully consistent with the criteria set out in the Rome Statute. Fairness, transparency and consistency are important to ensure the legitimacy of this new institution in the eyes of the whole world. European Union Member States should ensure that their handling of this process sets a positive example. Parliaments, professional associations, and non-governmental organisations around the world can also contribute to this process by recommending potential candidates for consideration by states parties and by evaluating the qualifications of all those candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">I only wish to add how much the entire Commission appreciates the European Parliament’s tireless advocacy on behalf of a strong and effective International Criminal Court. We look forward to continuing this positive relationship on behalf of the ICC well beyond the Court’s first operational session next autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, we have got into a bit of a muddle with the timetable here and my group's bureau has been meeting since 5.30 p.m. It is advisable for the group chairman to be in attendance, so I would crave your indulgence if I leave immediately after my speech, something that I have never done before.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the international community set up this International Criminal Court? It was set up because the Rome Statute of the Court states that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished. That is precisely our group's position. Our values are human dignity, freedom, democracy and the rule of law and no one has the right, except in self-defence, to kill another person or wound their dignity. This dignity is for everyone, for Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, people of no religious persuasion, people from large and small countries, for all the people on this earth. No individual and no country has the right to escape punishment for crimes which concern the international community as a whole. No one, no person and no State, is above the law. That is why we want the International Criminal Court to be effective and capable of acting, and I very much welcome the clear statements made by both President Møller and Commissioner Patten. We expect all EU Member State governments and parliaments to do all they can to ensure that this International Court is able to work properly and effectively. We call in particular on the accession countries not to enter into any agreements before we have agreed on a common position within the European Union, and I hope very much that on 30 September you will succeed in drafting such a common position. I very much regret the fact that Romania, an accession country, has concluded an agreement without first awaiting the European Union's position. It has not acted in solidarity with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion allow me to say this: despite the fact that the motion naturally contains a certain amount of criticism of the United States, this is no reason for us now to adopt an anti-American attitude. This is more an example of a case where our opinions differ, and we should discuss this without by so doing ceasing to be partners and friends of the Americans. In a partnership it is usual for differences of opinion to be expressed and in any case we Europeans should act more in unison. We have more reason to ask ourselves questions than to criticise the Americans. This means that here too European unity is actually already part of the answer.</p>

The founding of this Criminal Court is a European Union project and at the same time it symbolises our system of values. That is why this House regards the Treaty as an integral part of the Copenhagen political criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle behind this Treaty is plain and simple. Anyone who has committed genocide or war crimes, anyone who is guilty of crimes against humanity should not go unpunished. That is why it is completely incomprehensible that the demand should be made that not all criminals should go before the court, but that some of them, regardless of the seriousness of their crime and solely on the basis of owning a particular document, should be excluded from its jurisdiction. This demand made by the Bush administration would stand in total contradiction to the aim and purpose of the International Criminal Court. It is not only absurd but also unacceptable, and for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is firstly unacceptable because exempting all of the nationals of a State would mean that the jurisdiction could only be selective and would therefore take the principle of the universality of justice to absurd lengths. Secondly it is unacceptable because it views all of the nationals of one particular State as potential war criminals. I oppose this generalised anti-Americanism in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Some States – so far 12 in number – have succumbed to the huge pressure exerted on them by the United States of America and signed a bilateral agreement with the USA. I deeply regret this and think that it will have consequences for our relations with these States. In any case, tomorrow, in a joint motion tabled by four groups – and it is also exceptional, Madam President, that a joint motion should be tabled in this Parliament – the European Parliament will adopt a very clear position on this.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, the establishment of the ICC marks a huge step forward in enforcing, at a global level, the principle of the rule of law which is fundamental to all liberal democracies. While ad hoc tribunals, such as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, are doing invaluable work, there is no substitute for a permanent court with the mandate and legitimacy to prosecute criminals wherever they may hide. We need only look at Croatia's refusal to hand over General Bobetko to The Hague on the grounds that Croatia was not the aggressor, to see the problems which can arise.</p>
<p class="contents">In negotiations on the Rome Statute, Europe bent over backwards to achieve an outcome which would accommodate American concerns. It is therefore a matter of deep regret to Liberal Democrats in this House that a number of countries have refused to sign the Rome Statute for the ICC. These countries include Iran, Iraq, North Korea and the United States. If we follow the old adage 'you will be judged by the company you keep', what message does the USA's presence in this group of refusniks send to the world? Especially when taken in conjunction with America's disavowal of the Kyoto protocol, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Biological Weapons Convention. It is bad enough that the USA is refusing to ratify the Rome Statute, but to try to strangle it at birth by reaching bilateral agreements with countries such as Israel and Romania in order to prevent its nationals being surrendered to the ICC is terrible.</p>
<p class="contents">UN Security Council Resolution 1422 also sets a dangerous precedent and should not be renewed next July. The European Union should do its utmost to avoid undermining the ICC before it has even begun its work. I therefore urge the President-in-Office of the Council to recognise the storm-clouds gathering over this issue and to pull the EU Member States together under one umbrella. In an age of instability it is understandable that the EU wishes to avoid a breakdown in transatlantic relations, but any agreement with the USA must be supported by all EU countries and be consistent with the Rome Statute. Another failure on our part to show unity would further undermine the EU's credibility in foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get our own house in order. The countries wishing to join us, including the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Malta, must understand that the values the ICC represents are fundamental to the European Union, and that speedy ratification of the Rome Statute would prevent any delay in their accession. We urge Romania not to ratify its bilateral agreement with the USA, and it is also important for the Union to act together within the ICC in terms of financial support and the appointment of judges, the prosecutor and staff. By acting together, Europe can contribute greatly to making the ICC work, and thereby reassure the USA that the Court is serious and poses no threat to their law-abiding nationals. We must work to bring the Americans on board at a later date. Neither government must forget that we are accountable to the court of world public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Madam President, the ICC is a symbol of the world for which we strive – a world in which human rights and international law will be upheld everywhere, and most of all, a world in which no shelter will be given to those guilty of the vilest crimes. Let us work together to enable the court to get off to a flying start when it becomes operational in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I too apologise to the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, but I must leave the debates, since I must chair a meeting of my party.</p>

The facts are: the total rejection by Washington of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court; the postponement by the United Nations Security Council, under United States pressure, of any prosecution by the ICC, first until 1 July 2003, and then until 2004 or maybe 2005; and the bilateral agreement on immunity pursued by the United States with some foreign governments, among them two European governments namely Great Britain and Italy, seeking for a law to protect American forces abroad – a law that would authorise military action anywhere, even in the Netherlands, to liberate any American personnel detained by the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we need any other proof of the intention of the Bush administration to torpedo the ICC?</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays there are American troops in 140 countries throughout the world, in more than half of these countries with permanent bases. So we are confronted with a superpower which does not allow any other law but its own, on its military forces or its civilian personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten has just stated, grumbling against the United States is no substitute for a European foreign policy. I entirely agree with him. I hope he will agree with me that lamenting, whining and giving in through endless useless transatlantic dialogue on an issue of such gravity is no foreign policy either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With good reason, with very good reason, this Chamber is expressing wide support for the International Criminal Court and widely condemns the stance of the United States, which wants to nip the International Criminal Court in the bud. This was most recently illustrated by the very harsh words in the national security plan that is being presented this week. Unfortunately, as Mr Møller already indicated, this topic is no longer being debated outside of this Chamber. The Council is working on a compromise. The question is no longer <span class="italic">whether</span> exceptions should be made, but <span class="italic">how far</span> they go for the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">With this, a horrible dilemma is being created for Parliament and for anyone who is kindly disposed towards the International Criminal Court, for the choices are: either no compromise, and this translates into a divided Europe and continuous opposition by the United States, or opting for damage limitation, for example, by restricting the exception to soldiers with peace missions. This would result in a united Europe, an end to US opposition and quite possibly the withdrawal of this diabolical <span class="italic">The Hague Invasion Act</span>. These are the true choices we are facing, whether we like them or not.</p>
<p class="contents">This raises the vital question – and I would at the same time make an appeal to Mr Møller, as President-in-Office of the Council – whether this compromise undermines the International Criminal Court permanently and structurally. This is where my group draws the line. And I would urge Mr Möller to draw the line there in respect of the Council's willingness to strike a compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Victims carry the effects of crimes for the rest of their lives, whereas perpetrators often go unpunished. When national legal systems fail, the International Court of Justice will hopefully be able to do its bit to restore justice. I am therefore behind the establishment of the Criminal Court and hope that its jurisdiction will be recognised by many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the pursuit of justice, however, it is just as important to pursue wisdom, fairness and common sense. Otherwise, the remedy might be worse than the disease. After all, as the Romans said in their day: <span class="italic">summa ius, summa iniura</span>, the greatest justice is the greatest injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly where the present resolution on the Criminal Court falls short. The resolution has failed if the statute establishing the Criminal Court is included in the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. If this were the case, this prerequisite would even apply explicitly as an accession requirement for the candidate countries, which is unfair. At this stage, the EU cannot extend its political criteria and suddenly prescribe new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this resolution threatens to intensify the controversy surrounding the Criminal Court. The resolution's tone will not exactly win the Americans over to adopt the European view. It will rather antagonise them. A controversy of this kind does real harm to the Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Criminal Court would rather benefit from depoliticisation. Only in a politically calm climate can the Court develop more legitimacy and, one may hope, persuade countries such as the US to gradually leave behind their objections to this Court. Temporary compromises should therefore not be ruled out. It is in this spirit that I have tabled amendments, which, I hope, will be adopted in the interest of the Criminal Court itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Radicals have believed this for many years, and for many years we have fought, as we are continuing to do now, to bring this Court to birth and to see it grow and gradually acquire universal jurisdiction and be recognised by as many countries as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have spoken, indeed almost the entire debate has been on the issue of the United States, but I would also point out that many of the world’s largest countries – China, Russia, India, Indonesia, the entire Arab world with the welcome exception of Jordan, and almost all of Asia with very few exceptions – have yet to sign on the dotted line. There is therefore a great deal of work still to do. Of course, it is right to concern ourselves with the issue of the United States, with its attempt to obtain exemption and, in particular, a sort of immunity for its citizens with a diplomatic offensive, but I want to stress here that the European Union must direct its greatest endeavours – and the action plan endorsed by the Council and the Commission’s work are important in this respect – towards ensuring that the Court has that universal jurisdiction which will guarantee its authority and status and which will also, indeed, show those who are openly against it like the US administration that, maybe one day, under another administration, their country might change direction. Proof of this is the fact that, a few days ago, the former President, Bill Clinton, was publicly criticised for failing to achieve ratification of the Rome Statute when he was President.</p>
<p class="contents">This is important: it is important that the Council adopts a position which gives due consideration to the importance of preserving the Statute in its entirety, that, should a compromise be reached with the United States, it takes into account the question of non-reciprocity – the need for guilty citizens or, at any rate, citizens who have been accused of a crime, to be tried before the US Courts in any case – and, most importantly, that it takes into account the fact that any exception must be restricted, where appropriate, to military and civilian staff sent on mission by the United States and must not be extended, as the United States is requesting, to all US citizens indiscriminately, for this would be absolutely unacceptable and intolerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, it is a step removed from the domination of blunt power motives in politics. The European Union is itself an example of a political structure in which the idea of a Community based on the rule of law is paramount. This is why we set great store by the Court's further consolidation, so that it can attract wide public confidence. The attempt to limit the Court's scope on power political grounds is diametrically opposed to the plans we have in mind for the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, it was to be expected that some states would object to this Court. We were, however, expecting these objections from, for example, the rogue states. They, indeed, have a great deal to fear from the Court, which is also the intention. The Court will need to have a preventive effect, which is particularly useful for training military personnel and also as a warning for politicians who want to take the wrong turn. The attempts by the US practically to undermine the Court have come as a great surprise to us. Indeed, we could assume that the United States would share fundamental legal concepts with the EU. In fact, I believe that the definition of America's national self-interest mentions the promotion of democracy. This means that the US itself continues to pursue democracy, including the legislation that this entails. We underline all the more now that agreement with the Court of Justice must be part and parcel of the Community acquis. This follows on from the criteria of Copenhagen. This is why we want to take a tough stance with regard to bilateral agreements and applaud the fact that Romania has already backtracked in a sensible manner. We also hope that the Council, and where necessary the Commission, will be broaching this subject in dialogue with countries associated with us, and certainly with all candidate countries. The resolution is sufficiently clear. I should like to flag the need for some self-criticism when the EU dishes out criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States takes on the lion's share of all peace missions. It is even the case that the European Union always needs the Americans in order to be able to take action. This means that the Americans also run the greatest risks of making huge blunders. This is less so for Europeans. Europe's criticism would therefore gain more weight if the European Union were to accept a more proportionate share of the operations under the wings of the UN, which still needs to be negotiated, in fact. What should be principal, is that only an unadulterated clarification of the Court's statute can be offered, particularly as an explanation of the fears that are probably unfounded. A so-called agreement with the US will need to remain within the not even so terribly rigid framework of this statute at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few weeks ago, things looked set to end in complete disaster when Italy and Great Britain threatened to conclude bilateral agreements with the US, as a result of which certain countries, including the US, or groups of citizens, including American military, would be permanently excluded from prosecution by the International Criminal Court. Signing an agreement of this kind must be viewed as detrimental to the agreement of the International Criminal Court. I am referring in this respect to the sound legal advice gained by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the United Kingdom and Italy ultimately did wait for a European consultation, and we in Parliament are now able to give our opinion on this matter in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court's very existence is on the line, as destructive bilateral agreements undermine its raison d'être. However, the question also arises again of whether Europe is able to speak with one voice. Not only as a trading power, but also as a bearer of values and standards in this rough and unsafe world, one that protects human rights and the international rule of law as a whole. A divided Europe, in which some Member States want to take advantage of Article 98 to permanently exclude the US or US citizens from prosecution – so including Al Qaeda terrorists with an American passport – damages our ideal of a Europe that contributes to peace, stability and security worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the ICC Treaty, all nations, including the US, can, and must, tackle their own human rights violators themselves for the first nine months. Only when this proves unsuccessful, will the International Criminal Court become involved. It therefore depends on national efforts whether the International Criminal Court should actually intervene. This should be sufficient guarantee for the US too. Europe should therefore remain unyielding and continue to speak with one voice. This is why I would ask Member States to abandon destructive bilateral agreements with the US, and urge the Council to remain united. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alas, most of the authors of these crimes have escaped justice. Only the German National Socialists and the Japanese leaders were tried by those who defeated them, some of whom should have also been in the dock. On the other hand, the international socialists such as Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot enjoyed total immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Would an International Criminal Court have avoided these crimes, or at least punished the murderers? I have my doubts. The ICC member countries do not have the same concept of law. The powerful countries will continue to evade the law, and, even here, some speakers such as Mr Poettering have told us that it was wrong for the Romanians to have agreed to conclude bilateral agreements, but the US, which pushed them into this, would not entertain any criticism whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The founding statute of the Court claims that the Court shall only intervene on a subsidiary basis, in cases where the Member States refuse to exercise their sovereign right or are not in a position to do so. If that is true, it is difficult to understand the fierce opposition from the United States. The abrupt change of direction by the US might well be viewed with a degree of cynicism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think either that we should criticise only the small poor, destitute countries that are being blackmailed but surely also the large rich ones, the ones actually responsible for the blackmail in the first place. This shows that in the European Union we need a calm, unified position on the USA, and we lack this at the moment. On the one hand we have a Head of Government in London who acts as though his country were the fifty-first US State. On the other, we have a Head of Government in Berlin who to hear him talk would seem to be confusing Baghdad with Washington, and who gets his first message of congratulation after the elections from Saddam Hussein. I believe that both of these approaches are wrong. We need a calm, unified, but critical and independent position on the USA. This is not least in the interests of the USA itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening international law and its instruments is a fitting response to 11 September; this then includes the International Criminal Court, which we have been fighting for years and which is an indispensable instrument. The Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are actually doing an excellent job, but they are repeatedly discredited in propaganda as dispensing victor's justice. This is wrong! However, if we are to have objective standards in the long term we really do need to strengthen international criminal law in respect of crimes against humanity and genocide, and we need an International Criminal Court that is there for everyone in an equal capacity. We should be clear on one thing: history teaches us that for example the League of Nations failed because this splendid idea emanated from the USA but the USA itself did not participate in it. We call on our American partners and friends to work together with Europe to strengthen international law and the Criminal Court, because otherwise we are providing states in the Arab world, but also China and Russia – I might mention Chechnya and Tibet – with a pretext for ignoring international law on their territory. That is why Europe needs to speak to the USA in a self-assured manner, but calmly and reasonably and in a spirit of partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to ensure, however, that the aims of the ICC are fully achieved and that International Law is given greater credibility, its universal implementation must be guaranteed. The European Union and its Member States are therefore required to take action to hinder the efforts of the United States of America to strip the ICC of any legitimacy, granting itself a privileged status of immunity by means of illegal bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The primacy of the law in the international order over the balance of power and the law of the strongest is a noble-minded idea, which is still a long way from being fully realised. The primacy of the law in the international order will remain a pious fiction, however, if the world’s only existing superpower refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the institutions responsible for overseeing the implementation of International Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a refusal would even constitute a serious step backwards, because it sends a terrible message to the world community, a sign of the irremediable weakness of principles and of the persistent power of cynicism in international relations. The great dilemma facing the international community today is therefore to choose between an order based on law and an order based on the simplistic opposition of the forces of good and evil, in the battle between which the law is seen merely as an unpleasant hindrance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, as many countries told the US that rather than reject the ICC outright it should go along the Article 98 point 2 road, is it not difficult to criticise them for doing so? Thirdly, does not the US draft agreement state clearly that the parties expressed their intention to investigate and prosecute war crimes and, therefore, achieves the objective we wish to see?

<p class="contents">Firstly, Article 98 of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court cannot be used as the USA proposes. It is only applicable to NATO or similar organisations’ Status of Force Agreements designed to protect soldiers from sending States, but it cannot be applied generally to US troops or US citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, any country that enters into a treaty with the USA is not just in breach of the Rome Statute, but also of international law.

<p class="contents">Thirdly, the treaties leave the US Government free to decide if they are to be investigated or prosecuted <span class="italic">where appropriate</span>. This is not just contrary to the Rome Statute but also to the general duty to prosecute international crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is not acceptable to undermine the International Criminal Court’s role by protecting citizens of the only superpower from being held responsible for serious war crimes, something that would create the belief that only the law of the victor applies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the Council of Ministers’ view that the ICC should be protected and its integrity preserved and that the ICC should begin operating. That is also the Danish Presidency’s attitude, moreover. Our view is that, on 30 September, we should see to it that the EU countries work together and are also able to arrive at the same result. The EU countries should also ideally offer the same response to the United States. It should be borne in mind that the task of offering the United States a response is a bilateral one. It is not for the Commission to respond to the United States’ representations. We are concerned here with bilateral approaches, and we can therefore only put forward a recommended response. That is all we can do, but I also assume that the recommendation will be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Oostlander mentioned, we have had, and are continuing to have, dialogues with the candidate countries on this issue. I agree completely with Mr Lund that we must not have a cosmetic and phoney compromise. It was certainly something along those lines that Mr Lund said, for it is true enough that, when the rain comes, the façade will crumble and it may mean that everything collapses. We are of the view that we must have a global court which will have an effective deterrent effect upon those war crimes described in the statutes of the court.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the United States, the fact must be faced that it is not participating in the court, but we shall go on trying to get it involved. We have discussed the matter on several occasions with the United States, but to no avail. It is a brute fact, and the choice is between not caring either way or trying to obtain an arrangement whereby the United States is part of an international legal system. With this in view, the bilateral approaches can be used to devise an agreement along the lines that I mentioned and that are not at all different from those mentioned by Commissioner Patten. There is no difference at all between the Commission and the Council on this issue. If wordings can be devised whereby the United States becomes part of the international legal system without being a member of the ICC, that is nonetheless to be preferred to a situation in which the United States is excluded from, and does not have, any such legal system. That, moreover, is what our efforts are designed to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the United States does not want to see exemption from prosecution, either. Nowhere in Mr Powell’s communication does it state that it wants to see exemption from prosecution. That has never been the desire on the part of the United States. It is a case of it wanting to bring prosecutions themselves, not of it wanting war crimes to go unpunished. It is a question of it wanting to do the punishing itself. It must be appreciated, moreover, that what is most important is that war criminals should be punished, whether or not we can get them prosecuted in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">This is apparent from the letter written by Mr Powell to the individual countries, and also from the remarks he made to the European Union at our ministerial meeting with him. In this connection, the principle of subsidiarity, which applies to all of us who are members of the ICC, must be borne in mind. There is a principle of subsidiarity. The idea, of course, is that the court should only prosecute if the country concerned does not do so itself. That is of course the principle. It means, moreover, that it might be valuable if the United States were to give a guarantee that it would behave like the rest of us and bring prosecutions itself. I also assume that Denmark itself would bring prosecutions, meaning that I do not anticipate any Dane’s ending up in The Hague. I anticipate our prosecuting war criminals ourselves, if we have any. It must, then, be the task of the actual country concerned to say that a particular matter is so serious as to be something that we ourselves should no doubt deal with. The court must only be involved if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to deal with the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, I therefore cherish a reasonably justified hope that we can grope our way towards a solution whereby the ICC remains unaffected and with its integrity preserved, while still more countries undertake to prosecute war criminals than is the case at present. That is of course the crucial point. There will be no compromise whereby the court is weakened and the crimes concerned go unpunished. That will not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
