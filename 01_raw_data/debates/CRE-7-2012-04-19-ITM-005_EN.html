<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morten Bødskov, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(DA) </span>Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, honourable Members, I would like to start the debate here today by thanking you for the opportunity to take part in today’s debate on trafficking in human beings, which is a very important and pressing subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt about the fact that trafficking in human beings is a loathsome type of crime, which must be combated on all fronts. This is also a problem that we know cannot be solved at national level, but requires regional, international and also global efforts. In this connection, we need to coordinate European efforts to combat trafficking in human beings with those of our external partners. I am therefore pleased that the fight against trafficking in human beings is such a high priority for the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
<p class="contents">I also attach a great deal of importance to the fact that six United Nations agencies have jointly issued a commentary on our directive from 2011, and I am sure that this contribution will prove to be useful when the Member States come to implement the directive ahead of the deadline of 6 April 2013. In this regard, it should be noted that this is a directive containing minimum rules. The Member States are therefore free to introduce more extensive rules than those specified in the directive. The UN’s recommendations are also directed at the Member States in connection with their transposition of the directive into national law. Thus, whether or not a Member State wishes to follow the UN’s recommendations is a national matter insofar as these go beyond the requirements of the directive itself.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the requirements of the directive is that, in order to contribute to a coordinated and consolidated EU strategy for combating trafficking in human beings, the Member States should facilitate the tasks of an anti-trafficking coordinator. As you know, the Commission appointed the first anti-trafficking coordinator in March 2011. The coordinator’s role consists of providing general strategic guidance relating to trafficking in human beings, including in relation to third countries. I and the other members of the Council are particularly pleased that we now have an anti-trafficking coordinator, who does a very important job. The Commission will go into the coordinator’s mandate in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important element in the directive is the provision stating that the Member States should appoint national rapporteurs or establish equivalent mechanisms. The rapporteurs’ tasks include assessing trends in trafficking in human beings, measuring the results of anti-trafficking actions, taking responsibility for the gathering of statistics and providing reports.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, the Council decided to establish a network of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms for monitoring trafficking in human beings. As also stated in the United Nations commentary, it is particularly difficult to assess the true extent of human trafficking. One purpose of this network is to improve our understanding of the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings and to gather reliable data. The network is accessible to EU institutions and agencies and to relevant international organisations, including, of course, the United Nations. The Council Presidency, in collaboration with the Commission, coordinates the activities of the network and chairs the meetings. The network meets approximately every six months, and the Council’s Secretary-General and Parliament’s Secretariat are invited to participate in the meetings. The most recent meeting took place in February of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that answers your questions. If not, I am sure the Commission will be able to provide further information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Madam President, I think this is a very good opportunity to discuss this matter. Trafficking of human beings is a horrible crime. It goes on today, it affects millions of people – young children, women, men – and it is a shame. It is unacceptable that today, in 2012, this modern slavery still goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">I think – or rather I know – that the European Parliament has pursued this issue for many years,] and some Member States have been very quick to engage in these issues, while others have taken a little more time. However, I think it is fair to say that today everybody is very committed – Member States, the Commission, Parliament – to fighting this horrible violation of human rights. It is a priority for all of us, and it is very important for me personally.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive to which the Presidency was referring and which was the subject of your oral questions is very important for preventing and combating the problem, as well as for protecting the victims. It is a reflection of our joint commitment. It has a comprehensive and integrative approach. It is centred on the protection of victims and on human rights. It is gender-specific and does not only focus on repression but aims to prevent the crime and to ensure that the victims of trafficking are given the opportunity to recover and be reintegrated into society.</p>
<p class="contents">It brings robust provisions to deliver protection, assistance and support for victims. It asks, for instance, the Member States to ensure that all victims are dealt with on the basis of an individual risk assessment. Additionally, the Member States should establish appropriate mechanisms to identify, assist and support the victims in cooperation with different support organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are special provisions concerning children who are victims of trafficking. The Member States are obliged to appoint a guardian or a representative for each child victim and always to take into consideration what is best for the child.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding prevention, we fully share your concern on the need to put in place concrete preventive measures. The Member States are obliged to take measures to discourage and reduce the demands that foster all forms of exploitation. We also foresee the inclusion of a study on demand and supply in our upcoming communication on the strategy, with a view to better understanding the roots and causes of trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for preventive actions in addressing the role of the Internet in recruitment, as well as in advertising services, was repeatedly brought up during the consultation with stakeholders when elaborating the strategy. The strategy which we are currently in the process of writing will therefore consider the best ways to reflect on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the gender dimension, women, men, boys and girls can all become victims of trafficking. However, victims of trafficking are affected in different ways and to different degrees, so Directive 2011/36/EU and the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men should mainstream a gender-specific approach in all areas of human-trafficking policy and legislation, reducing vulnerability to trafficking and responding to victims’ needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive is a great achievement, and our focus now must be on transposition and implementation. The commitment of the Member States’ governments to enacting national legislation that would give full effect to the provisions is fundamental, and the Member States have one year left fully to transpose the provisions. In order to assist them – as has been mentioned – there is an informal contact group on the Directive. It brings together experts on the transposition of the Directive at national level. During these meetings, Member States can discuss questions related to this process that they consider important, and the European Parliament is invited to participate in these informal meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we welcome the joint United Nations commentary on the Directive and its strong focus on human rights. The commentary is a positive exercise by the United Nations’ agencies to combine the previously-adopted UN and Council of Europe legislation with the implementation of the EU Directive. It places EU policy in a global context, and this is crucial for consistency, as we are discussing a global phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked about the national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism. The Directive obliges Member States to set up these mechanisms. They will be responsible for the assessment of trends and measuring the result of the anti-trafficking actions: statistics, reporting, etc. Some Member States already have this in place, and others are now in the process of setting it up. The Commission will discuss, within the informal network, how best to implement this provision, and this will also be a question to be discussed in the contact group.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me inform you that the third group of experts on the trafficking of human beings was appointed by the Director-General of DG Home Affairs, Mr Manservisi. The call for experts was an open call, and the selection was made by a committee which ensured the presence of different specialisations and areas of expertise, as well as a geographical and gender balance. This group of experts included many human rights and gender experts, and they will feed into the Commission policies, advise us on policies and initiatives related to trafficking issues, help us to assess policy and assist us in identifying measures to be taken. Overall, this group of experts is a forum for the discussion of all issues relating to the trafficking of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The anti-trafficking coordinator, Mrs Vassiliadou, took up her mandate a year ago. The Commission is in the process of providing additional staff for her in order to support her and ensure that she can fully exercise her tasks and priorities. She has been working on making anti-trafficking policies more coherent, such as by mainstreaming the issue in different policy strands and ensuring coordination between the different actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Partly in order to ensure transparency, the anti-trafficking coordinator will have to contribute to the Commission’s biennial reporting on the progress made in addressing trafficking in human beings. In order to evaluate this process, as stated in your resolution on the prevention of trafficking in human beings, there is a need for better information gathering.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the Commission sent out a questionnaire to the Member States to collect data on the trafficking of human beings at EU level. We have received replies from everybody. A general overview of the data will be integrated into the strategy on which we are currently working, and the Commission will most likely be able to publish a separate analysis of this later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission funds many projects aimed at preventing trafficking both within and outside the EU. Some projects address the root causes: for example, there is a project in Kosovo that aims to raise awareness amongst the most vulnerable groups in rural areas of Kosovo. More information on this project and others is available on the anti-trafficking website.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an action-oriented paper aimed at strengthening the commitment and the coordinated action of the EU and Member States against trafficking in human beings. This will be done in partnership with third countries, regions and organisations at international level. The Commission has established an inter-service group on trafficking of human beings shared by the anti-trafficking coordinator. This group brings together diverse policy areas such as migration, asylum, development cooperation, trade, employment and gender policy, to name but a few. Coordination is one of the main objectives here, and that was the objective of last year’s anti-trafficking day, which resulted in a joint statement from seven agencies on ensuring future cooperation on trafficking between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been done and much is prepared. The strategy will be presented later this spring or just before the summer. I will be happy to come back and talk about this specific strategy once it is ready, but I would like to thank you for your strong commitment, for your engagement and for urging the Commission and the Member States never to give up on this and to make sure that we do everything possible to eradicate this horrible form of modern slavery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past few weeks, we have consulted with a number of civil organisations about the tasks that await us, and one of the participants told us that this directive was a damn good one. Pardon the language, but I wanted to quote them precisely. Of course this does not mean that now we can sit back and relax after a job well done; in fact the lion’s share of the work is essentially still before us. Despite the fact that this is indeed a good directive, and we must thank the Commission and the Council for making it possible through their good cooperation, the directive itself also has its shortcomings which we will sooner or later need to remedy, such as the temporary residence permit directive, which makes support to victims subject to certain conditions, while this new directive provides unconditional support to victims.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also deficiencies to be remedied with regard to the relations between the national coordinators and the European coordinator, and I feel that perhaps in the future it will be important for us to pay increased attention to the coordination of the various policies. The same applies to development policy, as even today we are not really taking into account how important it would be to give higher priority to the issue of human trafficking in development policy. We will keep a close eye on this new strategy and we are eager to see what results it will bring. My question is this: what added value can we expect from it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive takes a holistic approach with the focus on both preventive measures and the prosecution of human traffickers. It is now more than a year since the directive was adopted, and I am pleased to be hearing about its implementation from both the Commission and the Council today.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, I was at a seminar with the EU anti-trafficking coordinator. There she announced that the most recent statistics available from the Member States indicate that a clear majority – over 70% – of the victims of trafficking in human beings are women who have fallen victim to the sex slave trade. Despite this being confirmed by a number of other studies, I find that there is resistance to talking about this fact. Instead of discussing sex slavery, which according to all available statistics accounts for the majority of cases, there is a tendency to want to focus on exploitation in other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This is deeply regrettable, as we will never get to grips with trafficking in human beings if we do not have the courage to speak openly about all of its causes. A very significant part of the directive is concerned precisely with working to reduce demand and taking measures to diminish the actual profitability of trafficking in human beings. According to Article 18, the Member States are not only obliged to take action against trafficking in human beings, but also to take appropriate measures to discourage and reduce the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation related to trafficking in human beings. This includes examining the purchasers’ responsibility, irrespective of what type of slavery they are paying for. It is therefore particularly interesting to see how the Council and the Commission are looking at this in the light of the legislation. I look forward to the evaluation that we will eventually receive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We hope that the directive, including its provisions concerning criminal offences, will be implemented in a timely, consistent and effective manner and will, together with the EU strategy, lead to improved cooperation cross the Union. The further legal framework would enable Member States’ actions to have a greater impact not only in terms of law enforcement but also for the protection and assistance provided to victims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that the European anti-trafficking coordinator is provided with appropriate tools and means of cooperation, in order to coordinate efforts at national and EU level. Existing data show that women and girls represent the majority of trafficked people, and we should take into account the root causes of such phenomena, particularly when we speak about gender-based discrimination and violence against women. In this respect, transposing and implementing this directive with an open gender perspective is crucially needed. Further efforts in terms of ensuring the establishment of national rapporteurs responsible for gathering gender-separated national statistics and data would be welcome. In terms of prevention and information, gender-sensitive awareness campaigns still remain to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as rapporteur for the European Parliament on the Victims’ Rights Package, I would like to stress the need to draw up a solid and ambitious legislative framework establishing minimum standards for victims of crimes and facilitating the recognition of protection measures – civil or criminal –across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Council will also acknowledge that supporting victims and recognising their rights throughout the Union is essential in order to facilitate the reporting of crimes and effectively combat organised crime networks which abuse thousands of people and deprive them of their fundamental rights, regardless of their nationality and place of residence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tried to make significant representations to our joint debates in this Parliament, to the effect that victims of human trafficking should receive protection in the form of a residence permit. We have not been successful; what we are now left with is a temporary residence permit and a temporary residence permit means that after a court case, for example, you could still be sent back to the place from which you were trafficked, possibly even back to the people who contributed to your being trafficked in the first place. That remains a shortcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see, however, that the victim package which is now being negotiated with the Council acknowledges that trafficking victims deserve support, regardless of their legal status, no matter whether they are legal or illegal.

This is a modern form of slavery, the incidence of which across Europe continues to grow at an alarming pace. In my own region of Northern Ireland there is a huge problem with human trafficking. Criminal gangs use the province as a gateway to traffic people into the mainland United Kingdom, as well as retaining some victims for local illegal activities. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, the PSNI, is engaged in a comprehensive battle against human trafficking, which focuses both on rescuing victims and catching perpetrators. However, the first person who was convicted on a charge of human trafficking in Northern Ireland was only sentenced a few weeks ago. This shows that we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commissioner’s statements here today. It is important that this issue is not brushed under the carpet. It should remain very much at the top of the agenda in the fight against crime, and I believe the most important tool for fighting this crime is tougher sentencing of the perpetrators of human trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrible injustice continues to be done, primarily to women, who even today, now, while we are debating in the European Parliament, are being forced, by threats of blackmail, beatings or even – for those who dare to disobey – death, to provide sexual services in the wealthiest countries of the European Union. They are denied human dignity and often the forces of law and order in the individual countries throw up their hands and pretend that the problem does not exist. This is a terrible shame, to put it mildly, and for this reason we should take all necessary steps to enable effective remedial measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this type of behaviour should always be classified as falling within the category of organised crime. Secondly, it should attract sentences that are appropriately severe, more severe than for ordinary criminal activity, as criminals supported by gangs constitute a greater threat, are able to cause more damage and have a feeling of impunity. Thirdly and finally, a system of extended confiscation should be introduced in all European Union Member States in order to remove the motive and raison d’être for organised crime in human trafficking, which is to earn money from the harm done mostly to women, but also to children. All of the above actions, carried out together and in a coordinated manner in individual European Union Member States, and also coordinated by the European institutions involved, could deliver results, but only if they are undertaken multilaterally and only if they are carried out decisively and consistently, an approach that so far has been lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The media are always reporting terrible stories of women from Eastern Europe or from the developing world who are tricked into coming to countries in Western Europe with promises of honest work and then undergo nightmarish experiences, beatings and sometimes death. We must put an end to this and we must protect the victims of these crimes. We must act firmly and resolutely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore focus on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and girls are lured and enticed into a cruel world of exploitation. Since the demand to buy women exceeds the number of prostitutes in Europe, these women are recruited from other parts of the world to be bought and sold over and over again. This is contemptuous, shameful, colonial and even racist. We need to have the courage to take a decision that will challenge this. Purchasing sex is not acceptable. In my capacity as a man, I say ‘no’ to men’s right to buy women’s bodies. In my capacity as a politician, I say that we must have the courage to take a decision that will truly abolish trafficking in women.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obviously many important measures needed, for example we need to increase our support for the victims of human trafficking, strengthen their rights, grant these victims the right to reside in the country in which they are exploited. At the same time, we must always remember that without the demand for women’s bodies there would be no trafficking in women and girls. This means that the real problem lies with the purchasers of sex.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we will need to go all the way along the chain in order to be able to put a stop to trafficking. In other words, we must also be able to prohibit the purchasing of sex. This has proved to be an effective measure in Norway, Sweden and Iceland. After all, it is not the women involved in prostitution who should be punished; it is the men that we should focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, combating trafficking in human beings in the EU is largely a question of combating trafficking in women and girls. In order to fight this effectively, we need the political courage to combat demand. Such a policy would be significantly more effective than the current focus on biometric identity documents, passenger information and increased border control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But there is more to be done, because the figures are stunning and the stories are heartbreaking. The issue is the millions of women, children and men who live as slaves in our neighbourhoods.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for a cultural paradigm shift, and the time of impunity has to come to an end. The culture of impunity, of abuse, cheating and oppression, has to be replaced by a culture which criminalises trafficking. All the perpetrators should hear our voice. They will not feel immune anywhere, in any corner of Europe. We have to join forces on this, not only by better training police forces and taking into account children’s and women’s special needs as well as victim protection, but also by adding some prevention. We need to do more than just persecute; we must also really improve cooperation and have stronger sanctions.

This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration.</p>

<p class="contents">The directive sets out common rules on the definition of a crime and the level of punishment and ensures greater protection for victims and especially children, whom I think are perhaps the most vulnerable category, face greater risks and therefore deserve to be protected by making punishments harsher, including for crimes committed on the web.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the directive is due to be transposed in 2013, so there is still a year to go. I would, however, like to put a few questions and ask what stage the Member States are at, how cross-border police cooperation is going, what figures have been collected on the subject, and also get some news on the anticipated awareness campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I asking these questions? Because I believe that the Commission ought to monitor the situation in the Member States in some way and support them somehow in the proper and effective transposition of the directive. The reason for this is that the directive is definitely a cutting-edge piece of legislation that we should be proud of, but my worry is that the Member States might be a bit late in reaching the objective or anyway come across problems in implementing it. Accordingly, I think we should be following this process carefully to get the best possible result from our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He answered without any qualification: the answer to both questions is the Roma. We need to examine the significance of that answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, criminal sexual exploitation of girls does not always involve crossing international frontiers. The grooming of under-age girls for prostitution by Asian men in the United Kingdom was first brought to public attention by our chairman. The authorities responded by prosecuting him for alleged incitement. It was only when he was acquitted that the authorities were forced to start prosecuting those responsible for the grooming.

I have met small children, very young children, who are forced to beg on the streets of Brussels, Paris, Stockholm and Vienna. All these people are examples of the modern slavery that exists today in Europe: a very profitable form of organised crime and unworthy of Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of all those people and many others, we must fight this crime. The directive we have been referring to is a very good tool. The Commission will make sure that it does everything to support the Member States in fully transposing and implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked a question on the Directive on residence permits. It is clear that not all Member States are making full use of it. We are right now studying the causes of this before taking further action, and the input and ideas of the European Parliament here are most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The upcoming strategy intends to move on from where we are with the Directive: to take a broad, consistent and coherent approach on prevention, protection and prosecution. We want to focus on training, raising awareness and providing information to key groups. We want to focus very much on the desperately-needed coordination that so many of you mentioned. We want to streamline our work on human trafficking and launch studies on, for example, demand and the root causes of trafficking in human beings. This will be a strategy for the coming five years; the aim is that it will be concrete, practical and measurable. It will be adopted later this spring or summer and presented to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to discussing this with you, and again I want to thank you for a very good debate and for your strong commitment to this very important cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The circumstances that we witness in connection with trafficking in human beings are abhorrent. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to assure you that the Council will endeavour to ensure that the directive is followed up and, as I said, we will do everything in our power to combat the dreadful phenomenon of trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we are in agreement about the need for a coordinated approach to the combating of trafficking in human beings, both at EU level and in the wider international community. For this reason, too, I think that the strategy on combating trafficking in human beings that the Commission is expected to present soon will be worth looking forward to, and that it is also worth appreciating the fact that we have good cooperation with Parliament and can look forward to new initiatives in the fight against human trafficking from you, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for a very good debate, which has emphasised the fact that trafficking in human beings is a despicable phenomenon that we need to step up our efforts to combat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I eagerly await the strategy that should soon be submitted to us by the Commission, providing a more comprehensive approach for tackling this type of crime more effectively and, at the same time, enhancing the prevention and victim-protection aspect, paying particular attention to children and other high-risk groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive adopted in 2010 represented an important step in creating common minimum standards and eliminating the legal vacuum that existed. Its timely transposition – by April 2013 – now falls to the Member States. I also consider it positive that an EU anti-trafficking coordinator has been created, which should contribute to the existence of a more coherent and coordinated anti-trafficking strategy, setting out general policy guidelines and directives to be applied in cooperation with third countries. The Commission’s creation of a working group on human trafficking and the Council’s creation of a network of reports and equivalent mechanisms for analysing this phenomenon and collecting reliable data are also both positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only is it a serious crime, it is also a serious violation of a person’s fundamental human rights. The reality is that the exploitation of human beings is happening in our streets, towns and cities throughout Europe. Organised crime gangs are making huge profits by trafficking people into my own constituency of Northern Ireland for labour and sexual exploitation. An organisation that campaigns for ethnic minorities has recently stated that ‘Northern Ireland has the fastest growing sex industry in any part of the UK’, with victims originating from Ghana, Zimbabwe, China and Slovakia. This statement, coupled with the fact that the first conviction for human trafficking violations in Northern Ireland took place only in February of this year, highlights the urgent need to tackle this problem head on and, in doing so, help some of the most vulnerable in society. These victims are being sentenced to a life of misery and exploitation. We need to send a strong and clear message that human beings are not commodities that can be bought and sold for profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission estimates that several hundred thousand people fall victim to human trafficking within the EU each year. Eighty per cent of these are women and girls.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened EU activities as regards judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, including human trafficking. In March 2011 the Council adopted a directive giving definitions of crimes and setting punishments for human trafficking. These regulations are the first direct consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon in the area of substantive criminal law, and the first act jointly agreed in this area by the Council and the European Parliament. The purpose of this legislation is to bring about more effective prevention of human trafficking and better protection for the victims. Member States are to introduce the directive into national legislation by 6 April 2013. It is vital to have an action plan as regards combating human trafficking during the upcoming Euro 2012 championship. The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator should contribute to Commission reports on progress in combating human trafficking, reports that are to be presented to the Council and the European Parliament every two years. Human rights in relation to the victims should be at the centre of the strategy for preventing and combating human trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
