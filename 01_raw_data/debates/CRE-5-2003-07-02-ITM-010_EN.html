Due to health reasons he cannot join us and, therefore, I am reading, on his behalf, the speech he prepared earlier. I know he is extremely proud of being the rapporteur for the Marco Polo Programme and is looking forward to its passing through Parliament later this week.</p>
<p class="contents">As he reiterated in committee earlier this month, he felt that the three institutions were not far from agreement, and a close inspection of the common position proves this. Indeed, from Parliament's perspective, the two outstanding points that he felt needed to be discussed were resolved in the informal trialogue. Due to the success of the informal trialogue he felt that there was no need for a new, lengthy debate on the programme, which passed unopposed through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at its last meeting. As Mr Bradbourn has reiterated on many occasions during the formulation of this programme, it must strike a balance, and he firmly believes this common position would do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">To bury business in yet more red tape would, in his eyes, be completely the wrong approach, notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how the money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position will mean that the programme remains market-driven, thus providing an excellent opportunity to show that the European Union is prepared to help not hinder business, as is often the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you are all aware, the threshold issue is something Mr Bradbourn has been fighting for vehemently, not just on behalf of the numerous small and medium-sized businesses in his own region of the West Midlands of England, but for SMEs in general, which, if it were not for these low thresholds would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, his view was that by lowering the thresholds companies could work together in putting forward innovative projects that would benefit transport and, indeed, industry as a whole. By keeping the original thresholds, small businesses would have once again been ignored by Europe which, it would seem, is merely interested in showcase schemes which, while looking good, do not benefit the people who paid for them – us or the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme are improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system and also reducing road congestion in albeit a relatively small way. Your rapporteur justifiably believes that this lowering of thresholds is extremely important in obtaining these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">His last point merely reinforces one of the main aims of this whole proposal: to reduce bottlenecks. He agreed originally with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector. He still feels it imperative that we concentrate on practical ways to defuse these bottlenecks, especially at ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the implementation of this programme, the last thing Mr Bradbourn wants is to unnecessarily hold up the legislative process. As you will all agree, this programme is not only another piece of legislation; it is a significant signal to Europe's freight businesses that we can, and indeed we want, to help rather than hinder them.</p>
<p class="contents">The sooner the Marco Polo Programme becomes active, the better for Europe's transport sector. Thus, given the outcome of this common position and its unopposed endorsement from members of the Committee on Transport, the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, believes we can progress towards the second reading of the Marco Polo Programme without the need for wholesale change.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final remark, he would, however, reiterate the necessity of our open approach: the carrot rather than the stick, designed to encourage both the participation of, and leadership by, the business community. I apologise again for Mr Bradbourn's unavoidable absence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, in general, to thank Parliament for its constructive attitude, which, thanks to a tripartite and informal meeting which took place last November, has allowed us to reach an agreement which will mean that we can implement the Marco Polo programme quickly with a contribution of EUR 75 million in four years. This project must facilitate the development of intermodality within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Intermodality is absolutely essential if we want to make our transport systems more effective and efficient. Intermodality consists of overcoming the unimodal approach to transport and taking account of all the different systems and modes in order to optimise the resources and possibilities we have within the European Union in order to achieve efficient transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this programme we will be able to finance, amongst other things, the first sea motorway projects, which are already under way with agreements between Italy, France and Spain in the western Mediterranean area, and other projects of this nature in the Atlantic area, together with other projects relating to the combination of inland waterways and rail transport and, finally, also of sea and road transport of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to express my thanks for the work done. I believe it is a good text, that we have achieved a reasonable and balanced result and what we now need to do is to promote, through this and all the other measures, a competitive and efficient transport system which is at the service of economic efficiency and the development of growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By precisely targeting specific objects of assistance, the support programme aims to bring about the transfer of goods from the roads to more environmentally friendly means of transport. As part of this project to transfer traffic, for example, it was possible to give support to a barge service taking cargo to the Czech Republic from Magdeburg or from Hamburg. The catalyst actions call for particularly creative responses to structural obstacles. In my view, they should trigger huge demand, above all in rail transport, where – as is well known – the obstacles are numerous.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that Marco Polo is a good addition to the railway packages that we have introduced. In view of the urgent need for cross-border consultation on common priorities for the removal of obstacles, I could well imagine the third area for support – common learning actions – including the corridor conferences that Parliament has been demanding for so long. The fact that there is demand from so many quarters shows, of course, that the money will not be sufficient, and nor are we likely to achieve the objective of stabilising the 1998 modal split. It is fortunate that our request, that projects from the future Member States be included already, has been complied with. One does not have to be a prophet to be able to foresee the re-emergence of the issues of environmental compatibility and sustainability on the transport policy agenda at the time of the forthcoming elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a vital need to reduce congestion and improve the freight transport system, especially from the point of view of the environment, as the volume of traffic grows. EU enlargement will also bring new challenges, when transportation routes get longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the Marco Polo programme and is satisfied with the Council’s common position. The EU can bring added value by supporting innovative and new technology projects. The aim must be to switch from the forms of transport that cause the most pollution to the other most environmentally friendly forms. No form of transport, however, should be excluded from the programme. A diverse range of transport should also be involved, and that could include road transport too.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is important that, along with the new actions, we are able to support the improvement of existing work. Improvements may often be achieved here through a more efficient cost-benefit ratio rather than by embarking on an entirely new project. By concentrating on just new projects the danger of competition distortions in relation to the old measures is an obvious one.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been agreed in the common position that minimum thresholds should be halved regarding all categories of action. That would also enable the realisation of innovative projects jointly undertaken by smaller companies, such as SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s budget is quite modest and the objective very ambitious. I think it is important, however, that the regulation is now approved and that the first projects are got under way by the autumn. In the longer term it is to be hoped that Marco Polo will prove worthwhile and acquire additional financing. In addition we have to explore opportunities to increase financing for important projects that supplement the trans-European transport network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are going to vote in favour of the text proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but we cannot say that we are completely satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because the economic contribution we requested has been reduced by the Council of Ministers from EUR 115 million to EUR 75 million, a reduction which we believe is going to prevent us from achieving the objective of transferring the expected total annual increase in international goods transport by road to other alternative modes of transport, and this increase is expected to be in the order of 50% up until 2010. To this end, and according to the data in the White Paper on transport, the railways and ships should absorb an extra 39% in terms of tonnes of goods per kilometre than it currently does, which when added to its own trend of increase, which is now 29%, would mean a 68% total increase in its capacity for traffic, which I do not believe can be financed with the reduced budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as the Commission points out, with one euro of subsidy 500 tonnes could be transferred, with the EUR 75 million allowed by the Council, 37 500 tonnes per kilometre could be transferred, rather than the 52 250 million tonnes per year by which road transport is expected to increase. In other words, the objectives of the Marco Polo programme could not be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither are we pleased about the fact that the possibility of funding actions for the reduction and prevention of goods transport by road, without necessarily implying transfer to other modes, has not been included. We believe it is possible to act during the stages prior to the loading of lorries, for example, by promoting a more compact form of packaging of goods so that they take up less space and require fewer lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, although this may be the subject of a different proposal, we believe that it is also necessary to consider reflecting on the current model of production and distribution of goods. If we truly incorporate, without a single exception, all the external costs of transport, perhaps we will reach the conclusion that we should reconsider our theory of economy of scale in production and of the benefits of its concentration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
