<p class="contents">I felt that it was important to involve you, as MEPs, closely in the European Union’s talks and decisions, as we have done since the tragic events occurred. As you know, the European Council met to analyse the international situation following the terrorist attacks in the United States and to give the necessary impetus to the actions taken by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The talks rapidly led to unanimous conclusions, the text of which was made public on the evening of 21 September. I do not intend to read it out here in its entirety, but I would like to emphasise the salient points.</p>
<p class="contents">I will first inform you that the presidency is most satisfied to see the European Union decide that the fight against terrorism is a priority, and to reaffirm its unyielding determination to take concerted action under any and all circumstances. The terrorist threat is a test for European integration. The unanimity displayed by the European Council, the quality of its debate, and the adoption of comprehensive and specific measures all show that the Union proved to be equal to the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraordinary Council gave the Union an opportunity to get several important messages across. The first message is one of solidarity and cooperation with the United States. The European Union shares the same values as the United States: those of an open, democratic, multi-cultural society. The Union will stand alongside the United States to bring to justice the perpetrators of these barbarous acts, together with their sponsors and accomplices, and to ensure that they are punished.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that the targeted American reprisals are legitimate under Security Council Resolution 1368. We are prepared to commit ourselves to this line, each Member State according to its means. However, we must not underestimate the seriousness of this scourge. If we are to succeed, we must have the backing of a broad coalition, under the aegis of the United Nations. This coalition would include candidates for EU membership, the Russian Federation and our Arab partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message that the European Union would like to get across following this Council is that it is fully committed to fighting terrorism, and to this end has adopted an action plan comprising five series of measures. The first series of measures consists of bolstering essential police and judicial cooperation. To this end, the European Council has set a number of objectives, including the creation of a European arrest warrant and the establishment of a common definition of terrorism. The same European Council has also taken a firm decision to adopt measures for identifying terrorists and the organisations that support them in order to draw up lists of terrorist organisations. In this connection, the role of Europol and its cooperation with the United States will be reinforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The second series of measures in the action plan, which I consider to be very important, involves the development of international legal instruments. There are many such instruments that need to be implemented and it would no doubt be worthwhile examining, as India suggests, the idea of a general convention against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The third series of measures on which the European Union would like to work involves the funding of terrorism. Here too, specific action will be taken at EU level, particularly with regard to money laundering and the freezing of assets. The fourth series of measures involves air safety. The European Union intends to swiftly devise a set of specific, technical measures for this purpose, such as baggage checks, technical training for crews and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to draw your attention to the fifth series of measures, which involves the common, foreign and security policy as a whole. The emphasis has been placed on the need to coordinate the Union’s overall action; the idea being to bolster the common, foreign and security policy, in order for there to be an integrated campaign against terrorism, including the systematic reassessment of relations between the European Union and third countries in the light of any support that these countries might give to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium and long term, the fight against terrorism will also require the Union to strengthen its prevention policy and to become more involved in stabilising regional conflicts. As part of this, the European Union certainly intends to enhance its role, with the assistance of the United States, Russia and its partners in Arab countries, in order to work towards finding a long-term solution to the Middle East conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the development of the common, foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the European security and defence policy (ESDP) could have long-lasting effects. These EU policies must not be used as tools for reprisals, but as a means of prevention. Conflict prevention also implies an unstinting commitment on the part of the European Union to integrate all countries into a global system of security and sustainable prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must pay special attention to the problem of refugees. On this issue, the Commission will devise projects to assist Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The last message sent by the European Council was to reassure the European countries and the markets about the economy, and it will be helped in this endeavour by the conclusions of the informal ECOFIN Council held at the same time in Liège, and to stress the positive role the euro will play in this economic context that we are experiencing. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the content of the message of the European Council held on 21 September. To sum up, I would like to add two comments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as is so often the case, the crisis situation created by the attacks in New York and Washington has given impetus to European unification. The Extraordinary European Council on 21 September provided an opportunity to take practical decisions and to display genuine European leadership. The Belgian Presidency will endeavour to follow up its commitments, particularly at the forthcoming General Affairs Council in October and the Ghent European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while making the fight against terrorism a priority, we must not be diverted from other projects that are fundamental to European integration. I would like to confirm here and now that the Belgian Presidency will make every effort to comply with its programme on preparing for the introduction of the euro, enlargement negotiations and the implementation of the European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the preparation of the Ghent European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Ghent on 19 October will consider the three subjects already identified by the Belgian Presidency, namely the euro, the enlargement of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration on the future of Europe. In the wake of recent international developments, a fourth issue will probably be added to the agenda, namely the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the introduction of the euro coins and notes in 12 Member States on 1 January 2002, the President of the ECOFIN Council, Minister Reynders, the relevant European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, will present a detailed report on the level of preparedness of the Member States. The Heads of State and Government will thus have an opportunity to influence preparations, where necessary. They will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro, such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the preparations for the Laeken Declaration, the President of the General Affairs Council will report on the talks held to date by the foreign affairs ministers on this subject. In particular, the focus will be on the work done in this connection by the Belgian Presidency. The progress made to date mostly concerns the organisation of the Convention as an innovative instrument paving the way for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to consolidate this progress at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 and 9 October and then build on it with regard to two additional aspects: the status of the candidate countries at the Convention and the organisation of a Civil Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the presidency would like to see a consensus reached on the best way of defining the Convention’s mandate. The presidency would prefer to develop further or to reformulate the four themes of the Nice Declaration, with, of course, the objective of arriving at a broader agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">At the General Affairs Council of 8 October, the presidency will also give the Member States an initial indication of the possible structure of the Laeken Declaration. The preparatory work done in the General Affairs Council should make it possible for the Heads of State and Government meeting in Ghent to push ahead gradually with the plans for the Laeken Declaration and, if possible, to make further progress in this domain. Consequently, over the coming weeks, the presidency will strive, firstly, to convince the other Member States that the Laeken Declaration should not be limited simply to procedural matters; secondly, to explain the nature of the new elements affecting the Declaration’s content and, thirdly, to persuade the other Member States that this approach, in substance, should not pose any specific problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to reassure all those who have expressed reservations regarding the approach being recommended by the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The type of undertaking that we envisage does not give rise to insurmountable obstacles. On the contrary, it offers up a number of advantages. In my view, the question of knowing whether or not it is advisable to stick to the four topics of the Nice Declaration is not a genuine problem. This declaration was worded in such a way so that it is possible to widen the debate, using the four topics listed as a basis. Moreover, it is difficult to see what could prevent the Convention from taking the initiative on whatever subject it feels it would be useful to discuss. It has been clear since our meeting in Genval that the Laeken Declaration will simply ask the questions and will not necessarily seek to give any pre-prepared answers. The outcome of the Convention will be presented in the form of options, which should reassure all those who felt that their hand was being forced.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, while the aim of the exercise – which was acknowledged by all – is to ask the right questions, it is quite legitimate to seek to formulate them in the most complete, clear and pertinent manner in order to optimise the future work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the enlargement of the European Union is concerned, the European Council will be asked by the presidency to consider a report drafted by the European Commission on the implementation of a specific enlargement strategy. This report will be available as soon as it is adopted by the college. The aim in this respect is to check that the road map adopted by the Nice European Council and confirmed by the Göteborg European Council as a general framework for negotiation is being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress that the presidency has no intention of drafting any written conclusions for the meeting of the Heads of State and Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before I speak about the three subjects that Minister Michel also mentioned, which will be on the agenda of the Ghent Council, I would like to briefly talk about the Extraordinary European Council held on 24 September, in the wake of the tragic attacks on New York City and Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this Council was, first of all, an opportunity to unanimously express our shared sadness and solidarity with the American people. However, looking beyond these events, whilst we too experience this sadness and solidarity, I want to reassert our belief, and that of the Commission as a whole, that the fight against terrorism is not and cannot be a clash of civilisations. On the contrary, it is this fight that brings together all the nations of the world, as equal partners, against the forces that set out to destroy them, without regard for human life, without any respect for the values that people share and that transcend borders and cultures. And it is the concept of humanity on which the European Union bases its action. This is how our collective, global fight will achieve its goal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Extraordinary Council, the European Union outlined the main points of a common response to the threat of terrorism, a threat that is unfortunately not unfamiliar to some of our Member States and which the Heads of State and Government now wish to combat together, using every possible means.</p>
<p class="contents">At the informal meeting at Ghent, the Commission will report back on developments in the economic situation, and more generally, on the various measures that were put forward on 21 September by the European Council. The Laeken European Council will provide an opportunity to give a more detailed operational report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming months, the European Union must demonstrate that it is able to organise, take action, react swiftly and, of course, respect the fundamental freedoms, because this situation forces us, once again, to reconcile freedom and security. The most urgent measures, on which my colleague Mr Vitorino is working, include the introduction of a European arrest warrant to replace current extradition procedures and the adoption of a common definition of terrorism. I would point out that the Extraordinary European Council hoped to implement all the measures decided by the European Council at its meeting in Tampere in October 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">With the same determination, the Commission yesterday referred to you, Madam President, a draft Community regulation enabling us to freeze the assets of individuals or bodies that may have links with terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council will therefore be a good opportunity to assess very carefully the progress made on creating the area of freedom, security and justice laid down at Tampere. In the meantime, the European Parliament and the Council will be able to make initial progress due to several measures. In October, the Commission will present the biannual performance indicators, which enable us to monitor the follow-up of the Tampere Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let there be no mistake: whether it be regarding these matters and the other measures announced in Brussels on 21 September, the funding of terrorism, which I have just mentioned, the situation of air transport or the aid that we must give to the Afghan refugees, the European Union has a duty to achieve results, first and foremost to the Afghan refugees, who are expecting some progress to be made. I would like to reaffirm my belief that the most effective means of bridging what we call the democratic deficit is most certainly to respond to citizens’ expectations and to follow up our words with actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now move on, if I may, to discuss the forthcoming informal Ghent Council and to the first of the subjects on the agenda, which relates to the major challenge of the euro and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins. In less than three months, the euro will be here. It is crucial to constantly reiterate, to everyone we speak to, the reasons why the majority of Member States of the European Union took the decision to share the same currency. The euro is a political and economic undertaking; for almost three years, we have kept inflation under control and have had sustained growth because of economic and monetary union. The euro will provide the European Union with better protection against external economic forces and against international financial crises. Now is also the time to reiterate this. This is an achievement, and we can all weigh up the extent of our achievement. By using the euro on a daily basis, people, private individuals and businesses will benefit from the greatest transparency in prices, easier transactions and better investment opportunities. They will gain a better understanding of what an internal market can offer, one that is made up of almost 400 million citizens and consumers, 300 million of which will use the single currency. From 1 January 2002, the euro will, undoubtedly, make Europe more tangible, more visible than ever, and I believe that the circulation of the euro notes and coins will show in a very specific manner that the people of Europe are managing to achieve their common goals. The euro will therefore become a symbol of stability, peace and shared identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, when faced with such challenges, we must also hope and ensure that the changeover to the euro notes and coins is as straightforward as possible for 300 million people in 12 countries, when so many new methods of payments are introduced, along with 15 billion notes and 50 billion coins. In other words, we must ensure that we meet this unprecedented logistical and strategic challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has shown that it is playing an active and willing role to prepare for the introduction of the euro, and that it is concerned that consumers and businesses, from the largest to the smallest, receive the information they need. With the support of the European Union, Member States have put in place national plans for the changeover to the euro. Next week, my colleague, Pedro Solbes, will present a communication on the introduction of notes and coins, so that, in Ghent, the Heads of State and Government can put the finishing touches to the preparatory work that is underway. The European Union, working together, must ensure that this information is circulated as far and wide as possible in order to respond to the concerns that exist, and which are having a noticeable effect on price stability, and to force us to collectively resolve any technical issues in an accurate and practical manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The second subject which Mr Michel raised, and which the Heads of State and Government will bring up in Ghent, is preparations for enlargement. The Heads of State and Government will discuss enlargement because it is important to keep up the strongest possible political momentum for this project, whatever technical difficulties we encounter in relation to any particular aspect. In any case, politically we are already living in an enlarged Union. This has been made even clearer from our intensive contacts with the candidate countries since 11 September. In Nice, last December, the Intergovernmental Conference defined the minimum parameters that will enable the Union institutions and bodies to take in new Member States. Moreover, the European Council approved the strategy we had proposed for bringing the accession negotiations to a successful conclusion. These decisions unequivocally confirmed that enlargement is an irreversible process. We now have to implement, on a day-to-day basis, the road map the European Council adopted at Nice, based on the principle of differentiating between candidate states. We have to evaluate the progress made at each accession conference separately, which will in fact also enable those candidate states that are currently less advanced to catch up. In Ghent, the Commission will report on the progress made with the road map, presenting a kind of mid-term review of enlargement strategy, that will allow the Heads of State and Government to determine what kind of approach or impetus is needed for the further negotiations. In mid-November, the Commission will publish the regular reports in which it evaluates the progress of the candidate states towards accession. Let me say a last word on this subject. We know that enlargement is a difficult project, but we also want it to be a very ambitious one. It will succeed only if it enjoys the support of the people of all the countries concerned, by which of course I mean the candidate countries and their citizens, but also the citizens of the present EU Member States. At the instigation of Mr Günther Verheugen, and in liaison with the European Parliament, the Commission has proposed measures for informing the citizens of the present and future Member States and explaining the issues involved, the chances and the opportunities, without, however, concealing the problems or risks of enlargement. To that end we want to mobilise the Commission delegations in the candidate countries and our representatives in the Member States. But everyone must play their part, the institutions and the European elected representatives, as also the national authorities and, more broadly, all the opinion-formers in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, let me raise a last point, which will be debated in Ghent, prior to Laeken, and concerns the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government will have to extend and confirm the positions defined at the recent foreign ministers' meeting in Genval. Obviously this is the same subject the foreign ministers will or may debate in Luxembourg on 8 October. In Genval, the Commission reported on the situation and called for a new approach in the preparations for the future institutional reforms, taking account of the limitations of the methods applied in the past, for Amsterdam and Nice. For a long time, in fact, the European Parliament and the Commission had shared the interest shown by several Member States in a method inspired by the convention that prepared for the Charter of Fundamental Rights and brought it to a successful conclusion. The Commission obviously hopes the next General Affairs Council will formally mark the support of all the Member States for this formula. Let me just point out here that at a very early stage the Commission highlighted the importance, in view of preparing the future institutional reforms, of involving the various sources of democratic legitimacy that coexist in Europe and of preparing for these reforms as openly and transparently as possible. That is why we would also like to see special attention devoted to establishing a structural link between the activities of the convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference. Another link we would like to see is between the activities of the convention and the more general debate that will continue to be held and in which a growing number of associations, interest groups and citizens is already taking part. This forum on the future of the Union, for which more and more people are perceiving the need, should encourage an exchange of views that very closely reflects the concerns of civil society. I believe the convention must listen carefully to these discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the procedures for organising this future convention, several questions still need to be resolved before the Laeken European Council. Let me note here the very thorough work done by your Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo. This report very carefully and skilfully analyses all the questions at issue. It also discusses something I consider most important, namely how to consolidate and deepen the Union's policies. Like the rapporteurs, I too would conclude by emphasising the need to maintain the link between the institutional architecture and the European projects. It would be rather paradoxical to try to strengthen Europe's institutional structure, to strengthen the Community model, while at the same time weakening the major, or some of the major Community policies or allowing them to ‘unravel’. The four main themes identified in Nice must be tackled. I listened very carefully to Mr Michel's very coherent and, I think, ambitious words on how to consolidate the achievements of 50 years of European integration. That could mean that when the environment itself changes we have to make changes to the course of European integration, although without losing sight of its points of reference or its raison d'être. We will have to keep to a simple and effective decision-making system, but also strong common policies. For the European Union cannot confine itself to producing legislative rules. Through political union, through economic and monetary union, and also through certain major common policies such as the one for which I am responsible, cohesion, European integration must lead towards solidarity between peoples and nations, the stability of the continent, the balanced development of its entire territory and its regions. It is these principles and these common objectives that we must reaffirm at this moment in time when it appears so necessary for Europe to stand united beside our closest allies. When the Heads of State and Government meet in Ghent, they will certainly discuss the future Laeken declaration. So I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission attaches great importance to this Laeken declaration, which should in a sense set the tone and determine the spirit in which, as Mr Michel just said, we need to approach all the institutional questions, so as to ensure that our institutions are in a position to achieve our common goals. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, since we have some time at our disposal before the year 2004, rather more than usual for a change, which is rare, no doubt we can and, I believe, we must spend some of that time reflecting together on what we want to do together, checking that we really do agree among ourselves on what we must and can do together and, of course, integrating this fundamental political reflection process into today's new and grave international context, which emphasises and underpins the necessity, the value and the relevance of the European project.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September have changed the world, the drama of which event is shown by the way yesterday Article 5 (the assistance clause) of the North Atlantic Treaty was invoked for the first time in the history of the North Atlantic Alliance, thereby declaring that all NATO countries were required to engage in defence. It is important, though, to point out that this challenge has been thrown down not only to the United States and the West but also to the community of nations as a whole. I was told yesterday by someone from China – the People's Republic, not Taiwan – that fifty Chinese people were killed in New York. That means to say that these terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were an attack on nearly all the nations of the world. It is therefore necessary that we act in solidarity with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting to grips with terrorism is an intellectual, political, economic and military task, and it can only be done in the long term. We say again that terrorism, in so far as its causes lie in Islamic lands – for that is where the terrorists are – is not to be confused with the peaceful Arab and Muslim world. This must be repeated again and again! I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for travelling to many countries in the company of Mr Solana and Mr Patten. We will now also – Madam President, I thank you for your initiatives – be calling a meeting of the Mediterranean Forum, in order to consult with our parliamentary friends from the Mediterranean region. I would counsel strongly against any inappropriate rhetoric! I am not satisfied with what was said by Mr Nielson or by Mr Bolkestein. We must be able to rely on a Commissioner’s speaking appropriately and in cautious terms. We will discuss this on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents and, subject to the way these discussions go, our group reserves the right to call upon the President of the Commission and, if need be, the two Commissioners to elaborate here in the European Parliament on what they have said.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We now need more of Europe. We will be no more than a partner of the USA even if we are capable of dealing not only with foreign, security, and defence policy, but also with internal security issues. We need to cooperate with Russia. We welcome the fact that President Putin is having talks today with Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council and with Mr Prodi as President of the Commission. We want partnership with Russia, but the events of 11 September must not mean that we close our eyes to the human rights violations that are still going on in Chechnya. On the contrary, we must say 'Yes' to combating violence and terrorism if it originates in Chechnya, but 'No' to war on the Chechen people. We must also be an advocate for the rights of the Chechen people, within the Russian Federation of course.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, there must be recognition for the identity of peoples, which is one of the core values of the European Union. It goes without saying that we must proceed with the World Trade Agreements as planned, for nothing could be worse than for us not to transact our normal day-to-day business.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned Ghent. We support what you have said. We ask you to send out a signal for renewed close cooperation in combating terrorism. Not only should Europol and Eurojust, too, closely cooperate, but – in my personal judgment – this close cooperation is best guaranteed by their being based at one location. We ask you to send a signal to the acceding countries, that they are welcome in the European Union if they comply with the conditions. I am saying this as a German, for eleven years ago, on 3 October 1990, we were celebrating the unity of Germany, which was only possible because the road towards it was prepared by those Europeans who now wish to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What you have said about the preparation for the Laeken Convention meets with our approval. Let me express my gratitude for the way your conception of it coheres with our own.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark will be a personal challenge to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as much as to anyone else. We are all facing a challenge as regards the security of our institutions. I must tell you that I feel safer here in Strasbourg – which has nothing to do with the place itself – but because we know that, here, the police are French. When the President of the European Parliament gets a response from the Belgian authorities to the effect that greater protection for Parliament in Brussels is not necessary because there are no indications of attacks or such like, I find that justification far from adequate...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… but I call upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to have the European Parliament in Brussels more securely guarded by the security forces of the Kingdom of Belgium. I am given to over-reaction even less than I am to panic, but we need protection and security wherever possible. I ask you, in your capacity as the currently responsible President-in-Office of the Council to use your influence with the Belgian government so that the security of the European Parliament in Brussels may, so far as possible, be assured by Belgium.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group endorses the conclusions reached at the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels. The Council came at just the right time politically, and resulted in a sea change in the Union’s collective conscience. I should like to recall that this change was initiated by the Watson Report in early September.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it was not until after the attacks on Washington and New York that the Council woke up to the situation and began to press ahead, and we do welcome the change in approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that in our view it is very important for this action to be included in the framework of United Nations’ Resolution 1368 (2001), as stated in the Council’s conclusions. Kofi Annan’s proposal to establish a global convention against terrorism is also important. It is already under discussion in the United States and will receive the European Union’s full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Global responses to the globalisation of terrorism are called for. However, in addition to this universal approach, there is a need to express solidarity with the United States. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty was therefore invoked yesterday. A clear definition at all levels of the nature of the fight against terrorism is also needed. This fight will not curtail freedoms, it is a fight to defend the intrinsic freedom of every individual, namely the right to life and the right not to be subjected to indiscriminate violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Madam President, I believe the activities of the Justice and Home Affairs Council must be supported, as it works to consolidate both Europol and Eurojust. Common instruments must be developed, not only at European level but also within our respective countries. In this connection I feel it should be pointed out that Parliament can come under pressure from lobbying groups. This is already happening. The lobbying groups are very adept at exerting pressure or influence on the Commission and the Council. Please take note of this, Mr President, and pass it on to Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council. I believe we should respect the activities of others. I have in mind, in particular, the criticism of our activities in connection with the directive on money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to express my group’s disquiet concerning the legislation passed by the Italian Senate yesterday. It is entirely contradictory to your aims, and will hinder judicial cooperation and the fight against terrorism because its provisions make cooperation at judicial level quite impossible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left and protests from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I must appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering ... Surely, Madam President, this is a civilised House and those who resort to barracking have no place in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am addressing my colleague Mr Poettering too. He is very concerned about the statements made by certain Commissioners. My group would like all Commissioners to explain themselves before this House. Mr Poettering ought to confer with his political friends, especially with the Prime Minister of Italy, to ensure that no statements are made to undermine the European Union's action here and in the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Madam President, I should like to comment on the Ghent Council. The measures taken so far concerning the euro are good, and it is an important issue. However, we need to strengthen our economic capacity so we can respond to the world crisis. It is for the Council to do so, because it is essential for us to define an anticyclical policy and put it in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, with regard to enlargement, and here I am addressing all the political groups in this House, we must make a commitment on the basis of what you achieve at Ghent, and of the Commission’s progress report. This has to come back to Parliament. I should like to highlight one point. There is a lot of talk of progress along the road, and about the road map. However, we need to check whether the road and the road map will eventually lead to the same destination and whether it will be possible to comply with Parliament’s request that the countries involved should participate in the 2004 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the Convention. Firstly, I understand that the Convention has already been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Convention is to be established on the basis of its composition when preparing the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when you refer to options, are you not speaking of coherent proposals by the Convention? The Convention is not a research body, nor is it a seminar. The Convention is required to present proposals. The latter sometimes involve two options, but they are never options to be accepted or rejected. We do not wish to be involved in that kind of game.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, the Liberal Democrats in this House welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council. We are pleased that it took on board proposals from this House in the field of justice and home affairs on combating terrorism and indeed that it reviewed the Union's policies in other areas to ensure that we have joined-up thinking in our approach to this very serious problem. We regret, however, that it took a shock like the bombing of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to push the Union into using the legal powers that it has under the Treaty of Amsterdam to act in fighting terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats welcome particularly the Commission's proposals of yesterday for a Council Regulation to freeze the assets of terrorist groups. We note its request for urgency and will be pushing this morning within the committee I have the honour to chair to make a recommendation to Parliament this afternoon to adopt those proposals. I hope that the Committee of Permanent Representatives meeting this morning will add its request for urgency to that of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for action in this area throws into sharp relief the weaknesses and the contradictions of the European Union post-Amsterdam. These were not dealt with properly at Nice. I hope they will be dealt with at Laeken and through the convention which will be established.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten yesterday rightly lamented the inability of the European Union to act fast in situations like this and thus to enjoy the confidence of its Member States and to coordinate the policies of its Member States in an area where a supranational threat requires a supranational response. At times like this the Union must act fast, but finds it cannot act fast. The mechanisms of the third pillar leave Mr bin Laden laughing all the way to the cash machine. I challenge the national governments to explain to our citizens why Europe has been incapable of acting fast because of the curious and complicated mechanisms of the third pillar. When we act fast we find that we need urgency and urgency frequently leads to bad law.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue to adopt the necessary security measures for our citizens in a way which is infelicitous for the Union's institutions, incomprehensible to our citizens and ineffective because it allows for no proper legal, democratic or administrative control of decisions. I hope that the convention set up by Laeken will look at invoking Article 42 of the TEU to bring these policy areas fully within the core competences of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Many measures will be needed in the coming months. Commissioner Vitorino has provided us with an anti-terrorism road map outlining such measures. Clearly, in our consideration of these, a delicate balance will need to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the civil liberties which make our democracy what it is. The President-in-Office said this morning that we should not be blown off course on our other agendas. I agree with him. Those agendas include our agenda to consolidate citizens' rights within the Union and our agenda of anti-discrimination. Liberals in this House will defend, with the President-in-Office, the rights of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The House has received a proposed regulation on the freezing of assets. That regulation could potentially, depending on its implementation, have a disastrous effect on many legitimate Muslim-owned businesses. Therefore Liberals will be calling for a sunset clause in that regulation giving it a limited life to make sure that it is not being abused in its implementation. We look forward to proposals from the Council for the involvement of the European Parliament in determining the names that will be put on the list in the annex to that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Article 6 says that the Union is founded on rights. The Charter defines those rights and we hope that the convention will agree to insert the Charter fully into the Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, the European Union is facing several major challenges, which it will have to meet as quickly as possible if it wants to mount an effective, coherent and long-term campaign against terrorism, with particular reference to breaking up the terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Several colleagues have already discussed the first challenge, namely to avoid a clash of civilisations with the Islamic world. In that context, let me take advantage of Mr Michel's presence and congratulate him on his diplomatic activity over the past weeks, which, I believe, is bound to produce positive results in terms of establishing a very broad coalition against terrorism and its supporters. Creating a very broad coalition means, of course, securing the participation of as many countries as possible, but without losing sight of the fact that our enemies' enemies are not always our friends and realising that no state that forms part of this coalition is exempt from its duties in regard to democracy, the protection of human rights and respect for minorities. I am thinking in particular of Russia and China, which are of course important players but also cause us serious concern in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge, and it is certainly not insignificant, is to strengthen police and judicial cooperation without compromising individual rights and freedoms. In fact here, in the European Union, the parliamentary control is totally inadequate. I therefore think, and I believe we agree fairly unanimously, that it is important to include judicial and police cooperation in the first pillar. That would certainly be one answer. Furthermore, at international level, we urgently need to set up the International Criminal Court, a process that has been underway for several years but is now marking time. Let me point out that we vitally need this kind of court to try crimes against humanity, such as those committed in New York and Washington. We will have to mount a large-scale diplomatic action to persuade as many states as possible to support this project, in particular the United States, which is after all a vital player.</p>
<p class="contents">The third challenge is the problem of depriving the terrorist networks of their means of action, both financial and technical. We have already raised the subject of financing; we have a draft directive on money laundering that is currently making little progress and I think an effort needs to be made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament to ensure that this directive is adopted quickly. Moreover, we must realise that this is a first step; it does not go far enough but it is a determining step. In the long term, I am convinced we will be forced to take large-scale action to outlaw and abolish offshore banking and tax havens. Money laundering is obviously an important weapon in the hands of international terrorist groups and international terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I was struck by some information, which has not been denied, to the effect that even before the New York and Washington attacks it appears that shares in some companies – and I am thinking in particular of the two American airline companies and several insurance companies that were affected by the attack – were jettisoned just before the attacks. This could be regarded as insider dealing and I think that at the very least we need an international inquiry to check this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me turn to the technical level, technical being, of course, a euphemism for arms. Clearly the European Union will have to intensify its fight against illegal and uncontrolled exports of light arms and keep a close eye on the fundamental problem of the proliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons. I believe that we cannot avoid the need to take a longer-term look at the vulnerability of some of our technological tools to acts of terrorism. I am thinking, for example, of energy, of the risks posed by nuclear power stations, the majority of which are highly vulnerable to the types of action committed in the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as destroying human life, terrorism takes any possibility or capacity for democratic initiative away from the huge numbers of men and women who are fighting to change the unjust social and economic system of this world. Moreover, we condemn any attempt to assert the non-existent superiority of the moral, cultural or political systems of the communities of the European Union over other communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal security of the Union must be reinforced – and I agree with much of what Mr Watson said – but always and only in respect for fundamental rights and the constraints of the rule of law. Therefore, any extension of the competences or spheres of operation of bodies such as Europol or Eurojust must go hand in hand with the creation of a system of judicial and, most importantly, democratic controls, with Parliament playing an active role. Any attempt to use the danger represented by terrorism to restrict or eliminate, by any means including Union or national legislative instruments, the huge democratic waves of dissent and opposition to the dominant social and economic system which are now sweeping through Europe and the world, must therefore be rejected, just as those legislative practices also referred to by Mr Barón Crespo such as the Italian laws on international letters rogatory, which are of practical assistance to terrorist and organised crime groups, must be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the fight against terrorism, which is a crime against humanity, will increasingly be seen as the responsibility of the entire international community, that is of the UN, rather than the responsibility of a small number of wealthy, powerful nations who often use their wealth and power not to combat terrorism and its causes but to consolidate<span class="bold"> </span>their economic and political power.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair, poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism – never. This situation must be fought and eradicated by action, not just formal declarations, if we want our world to be at peace. This is another area in which we must take action if we genuinely want to eliminate terrorism.</p>

<p class="contents">I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief. I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on. But let me be clear about one point. As a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September it is now clear to us all that people are willing to engage in well-organised suicide missions to further their own political goals. That means, in the simplest terms, that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit, EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant, designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe. Easing extradition, while protecting civil rights, is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, and in particular within the Union, where free movement of persons exists.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union. Our finance ministers are going to bring forward proposals outlining a timetable for the implementation of the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering. The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union. There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive. Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union, together with Europol, must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat, but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce. We must all work together. A united front, spearheaded by the Union and the United States, will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A majority of MEPs want to see the European Parliament’s representation doubled from 16 to 30. The argument is made in terms of equality with the national parliaments which each had two Members in the Charter Convention, making a total of 30. The name of my political group refers to a ‘Europe of Democracies’ in order to emphasise that we want democracy in the individual countries and democratic control of the EU. Democracies can govern the EU jointly, but there is no European people, as such, to have given the European Parliament a mandate to negotiate a new constitution for the EU. My group and the intergroup SOS Democracy instead proposes that we let each individual national parliament present proposals for the next treaty and then let representatives of the national parliaments prepare the draft treaty that is to replace the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Commission, Parliament and the governments could be observers in such an assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">We would, at the same time, call upon the prime ministers to pledge that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the Member States. A treaty adopted in a referendum could bear the insignia ‘more democracy’ rather than ‘more Union’. We should like to create a slimmer EU with greater freedom for the Member States: an open and democratic EU that is close to the people and is governed by electorates and elected representatives in the Member States; a more flexible Europe, open to the candidate countries and to all other European nations. ‘A democratic EU’ sounds all well and good, but it can only come about when there is a European public. A living democracy requires a common language, culture, media, treasury of songs and sense of internal interdependence: in short, a European people. A ‘Europe of democracies’ is the art of the possible. The EU should be put on a slimming course and the focus shifted to cross-border matters which we cannot control as individual nations. In that way, there would be no loss of democracy but a benefit in terms of shared influence, and the people of Europe would vote in favour of the next treaty. Would they do so today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council? Dare you allow the Belgians to vote on the Treaty of Nice? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much has been said about air safety and security, many measures have been taken at European level. Curiously, though, there is not a word about our secret services; in fact, if there are a number of organisations that did not work, at any rate in the 15 Member States, they certainly include our secret services. Today we see them digging away and finding out all sorts of things. Perhaps it would have been better if they had discovered some of them beforehand. They cost us dear. Nobody is quite sure what they do; sometimes we wonder whether they do anything. No doubt that too could be a subject worth considering at European level and subjecting to parliamentary control, for they can present a risk: so long as we leave them total freedom of action, they will sometimes take inappropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the offensive aspect, yesterday the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, provided the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a great deal of information. He strongly emphasised the value of dialogue. However, I think that unless this dialogue is accompanied by a political project, it may risk merely reinforcing certain positions. We are currently endeavouring to forge an anti-terrorist coalition. There are, in my view, two main risks. Mr Poettering highlighted one of them: the measures to combat terrorism risk – and it is more than a risk, since they have already produced some very adverse results – provoking and encouraging state terrorism. Mr Poettering specifically stated – and I thank him because authorised voices in his country, like that of Mr Schröder, seemed to agree with Mr Putin, who has still not provided us with a shred of evidence that the Chechens were responsible for the Moscow attacks, a point Mr Lannoye also emphasised – that it can be tempting to use this great anti-terrorist battle to settle a few scores at home, in Tibet for the Chinese, in Chechnya for the Russians, etc. That is an aspect we must bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue is the Arab world. There has been much criticism of certain statements that were made. I believe we all agree that this is not a clash of civilisation between Islam and Christianity but, obviously, a clash of civilisation between democracy and non-democracy and that we have to take the offensive in that conflict. We must help all those people in the Arab countries, in the Muslim countries, who are fighting, often at the price of their freedom, at the price of torture, and often at the price of death; and this Parliament, our European Union, is certainly not doing enough in that respect. Examples such as Morocco and Jordan show that the Arab countries can move towards democracy. Other countries that might have gone the same way have in fact done the opposite, such as Tunisia: in fact, it would not take much to change the course in that country, which has a ruling class, a cultured class, an education system, and which recognises the rights of women, the equal rights of men and women. In that respect our policy is aiding and abetting Mr Ben Ali in consolidating a regime that is moving further away from the rule of law every day and is becoming enclosed in a vicious circle of state gangsterism. An offensive policy means supporting the people of Tunisia who are working for the rule of law, for freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the MPF delegation members approve both the ‘solidarity and cooperation with the United States’ and the ‘European policy’ headings of the action plan against terrorism adopted by the extraordinary European Council of 21 September. However, we feel the practical value of introducing a European arrest warrant and a common definition of terrorism have been rather overestimated. Similarly, it may seem a good idea in theory to give Europol new powers, but this organisation is not doing very well as it is and first we would have to call for an independent and objective audit of the way it operates. But these are all secondary issues. Overall, we approve the Council's conclusions. In particular, we welcome the establishment of Eurojust, which is to develop forms of judicial and police cooperation and create synergy between the existing systems instead of trying to demolish them. Like the Council, we also call for the speedy ratification of all existing international conventions, like the convention on the financing of terrorism, whose implementation has been seriously delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in spite of all that, Mr President, we are still not happy. That brings me to my main point.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Council adopted long lists of actions to be undertaken, they remain one-off measures and the European Union is still not really prepared to examine its own conscience. It would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 September attacks is currently concentrating on Europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centring their preparations in Europe, which they have used as their base. All this is not pure chance. The day after the attacks, a French newspaper interviewed the current president of Eurojust, Mrs Coninsx, asking her the following question, and I quote from the article: ‘is the loose Islamist conglomeration strongly established in Europe?’ Mrs Coninsx, head of Eurojust, replied: ‘Europe may act as a logistical fallback for these terrorists. It is, indeed, fairly easy to cross frontiers because of the Schengen area’.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows that. It is true for the terrorists, but it is also true for fissile materials, it is true for stolen works of art, it is true for illegal immigrants, etc. In fact it was only yesterday and in this very place that I accused the Commission of all too often concealing the problems of illegal immigration. Europol informs us that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter EU territory every year, a figure that I actually think is an underestimate. At any rate, it means that millions of foreigners live on our soil permanently and illegally. So let me ask you: if countries let in millions of foreigners without discovering them and allow them to live there illegally, can they be regarded as in control of their territory? Obviously you will all say ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the Council, and the Council alone, to issue strong instructions in order to restore some balance. The President of the Council has rightly said that the fight against terrorism will be global and sustained. We have to draw all the necessary conclusions from that, discard outdated points of view, give priority to security, review all the old strategies that are no longer appropriate and begin by admitting that controls do not prejudice freedom of movement; while they harm criminals they protect citizens' freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must, therefore, call immediately for a list of all the documents that need reviewing from a security point of view and, in particular, that disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which promises a total absence of any kind of control of individuals at the internal frontiers five years after its entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a general review plan, of which the Council must be directly in charge. That means we need to review Article 67 of the Treaty of Amsterdam...</p>

People are shocked. They feel for the victims and those left behind, and their own sense of security has reached an all-time low. People expect their governments to guarantee their safety. They realise that this is not wholly possible but they are asking for efficient and conclusive action, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is responsible for security these days has a complex task to fulfil. The need for true, European integration and international coordination has been brought into focus more than ever, both in words and deeds. Mr President, I very much hope that you will be able to carry out your action plan of 21 September effectively, and that the Belgian Presidency will be able to take specific decisions in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all asserted that the attacks were not so much directed at innocent victims as at the symbols of freedom, democracy and human rights, including the right to life. Nobody will deny that the European Parliament too is a symbol of these values. Of course, we do not want to proclaim ourselves as targets, nor do we want to spread panic, but many MEPs are worried, as already stated by group chairman, Mr Poettering. In Strasbourg, the entrances and the immediate surroundings of this building are under police surveillance. In Brussels, however, we are even denied the illusion of security. If, moreover, we infer from the words of the Belgian Minister for the Interior here that he sees no indication of a need for tighter security, then we have a real reason to worry. For terrorists do not give warnings, something which a Minister for the Interior should realise. That is why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to ask you to persuade your Minister for the Interior and the police in Belgium to think again. Not only in the interests of the safety of the MEPs of the 15 Member States, but also in the interests of their colleagues, their visitors, the safety of the city, which is the capital of Europe, and in the interest of the values for which we all stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, Europe must support the victim against the aggressor. We hold to our treaty commitments. We salute the firm and considered attitude of the United States government. We also welcome the European Council's expression of solidarity with the USA. All of you must make it your concern that Europe is not divided into doves and hawks!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union must play its part in forging a worldwide political alliance against terrorism. We appreciate what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, have undertaken not only in the Arab countries but also in Russia. We ask that you continue your efforts as intermediaries in the Middle East, above all between Israel and the Palestinians. They are in the best interests of us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must, join together in reinforcing our internal security. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is regrettable that the European Council, and the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers as well, have only now got around to partially implementing plans that already existed and had been thoroughly worked out. We expect action against terrorism, not reactions to terrorist attacks. In doing this, Europe must continue to be an example of how to maintain the balance between the right to individual liberty and the security of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order, in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few. We are not making this effort for a more just world order solely out of a belief that we will thereby be depriving terrorism of its breeding ground. On the contrary, we seek a more just world order because that reflects our values and our dignity as Europeans – a dignity we share with all the peoples of the earth!</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, if it is true to say that the world is no longer what it was before 11 September, then the European Union cannot stay as it is. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome your intentions for Ghent and Laeken. We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe could be broken by the crisis now facing the world. It could, though, equally, emerge stronger from it. It is at this crossroads that you and all of us will be standing in Ghent and Laeken. In this crisis, Europe can – and I would add – must show its citizens what the European Union is really worth. By this yardstick you and all of us will be judged.</p>

It will create a new framework for our daily lives and our political work. The subtitles on CNN have read ‘America at war’ for a long time now. Europe has been there. Europe has been at war. Europe has experience of being a theatre of war. The United States has helped us in the past, and we in turn must therefore, of course, help the United States now. However, Europe also knows that wars are not won with weapons alone. Conflicts cannot be prevented with weapons. Wars cannot be won with weapons alone and, above all, peace cannot be built with the aid of weapons alone. It may be the case that weapons are necessary, but we must be clear that other things are also required.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight two things that are necessary to the European agenda. The first is the urgent proposal we are debating at present. It is regrettable that it is only now that we are debating such a proposal. I wish to endorse what other speakers have said. I should like to emphasise that there is, of course, a reason why we are only discussing the proposal now. Far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter. There are too many people who do not wish to reveal what is in their hidden accounts. That is why it has been impossible for Europe to do anything before now, and it may well also prove quite difficult now. The second thing I want to say is that, if we do not gather grassroots support for further European cooperation, we shall lack the communal spirit needed to stand firm against terrorists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Afghanistan was on the list of forgotten countries before 11 September. Now, however, the situation has become all but catastrophic. The World Bank has produced a report showing that between 20000 and 40 000 children per day will die of hunger because of the economic recession caused by the events of 11 September. In the EU’s Member States, we have received a report to the effect that foreigners and refugees are being persecuted. This is shown by the Monitoring Centre on Racism in its report. We are, of course, all appalled at what happened on 11 September, but what these events showed us first and foremost was, of course, that the world has shrunk and that no one is safe. The American missile shield would not have helped in this situation. Nor did all the American military hardware help, either.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we are moving on to talk about the need to strengthen democracy and dialogue. However, the anti-terrorism package we have debated – not the one concerning the economy, but the other – reeks of distrust. The ambition to strengthen the police and intelligence services completely overshadows the fight to strengthen human rights, democracy and the rule of law. We will not accept increased powers, either for Europol or the intelligence services, until we have got them under democratic control. Combating terrorism must not overshadow freedoms of expression and assembly. I should like to ask whether there is anyone who believes that our world will become safer when we prohibit certain organisations. Terrorism, killing, robbery and the destruction of property are to be forbidden, Well, they are already forbidden. Those responsible must be caught, and they must be punished. I do not wish to defend anti-democratic organisations, but the question is whether our world will become safer if these organisations go underground and are made illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are limits to the number of problems that can be solved by legislation alone, and I think that the first package is evidence of more haste, less speed. Our task must be to remove the basis for terrorism. I therefore think that the Troika initiative was a step in the right direction and one that favoured dialogue and the creation of a broad alliance to combat terrorism. However, there are problems in the alliance. When China demands, as a condition of its being a part of the alliance, that we close our eyes to what is happening in Tibet; when Russia demands that we close our eyes to events in Chechnya; when Turkey demands that we close our eyes to the fate of the Kurds; and when Israel demands that we close our eyes to the situation of the Palestinians, then we do not have a safe world. There must be security for all, including oppressed people and also the 20 000 to 40 000 children who will die of hunger next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His name is Massoud”. We must follow him and defend those who are fighting terrorism, trying to restore their people’s freedom, democracy and human rights. Yet we did not help Commander Massoud when he came to Strasbourg in April to condemn the crimes of the Taliban.

<p class="contents">However, our statements of condemnation must be followed by practical action: words alone are not enough. Therefore, we wonder why it is that the terrorists’ bank accounts are only being frozen now, if the governments and intelligence were already aware of these accounts before. Why have the Internet sites which continue to promote terrorist initiatives and maintain links with subversive cells throughout the world, recruiting new terrorists all the while, not yet been condemned and closed?</p>
<p class="contents">We call for the Community funding and financing programmes aiding those governments which are not joining the alliance to combat terrorism and, in any case, continue to harbour terrorists on their territory, to be frozen immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning, I would like to draw your attention to another point, namely the timeframe for the preparation of the next IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that this Parliament does not want an IGC in 2004, for that is the year when elections will be held and the Commission steps down. However, would 2003, as Parliament suggested, be a good alternative?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, we have a saying ‘haastige spoed is zelden goed’ (more haste, less speed). When one considers the weighty subjects on the agenda, it very much confirms that more time should be taken to reflect. Moreover, the topics of the IGC are sufficiently interesting to be the subject of the election battle. In addition, it is also necessary to give the applicant states a vote in this important debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, 2003 is far too early and 2004 is far too hectic. Could the Council not decide to hold the IGC in 2005? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means, therefore, that there is more than simply a display of solidarity on our part. We are united in our fate. It is therefore logical that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked, which means that we are involved in NATO responses every step of the way. We carry full responsibility, and we must therefore be aware of the reactions that are heading our way.</p>
<p class="contents">All the terrorists wanted to attain was chaos and unreasoning revenge. The response to that must be measured and specifically targeted at the people and organisations responsible. The security instruments must be comprehensively reinforced. That is why I agree that Europol and Eurojust should clearly be given more scope and be integrated into a constitutional state structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The European arrest warrant, the common definition of terrorism and organised crime, more flexible extradition: these are all vital instruments. Member State Ministers who tire themselves out producing objections will undoubtedly be considered ‘useful idiots’ – to use a term from the cold war era.</p>
<p class="contents">What more is needed to enable us to safeguard our common internal security, whereby the sovereignty of Member States is used to benefit the citizens in a way that does not conflict with their interests?</p>
<p class="contents">Every Member State should realise that if they offer sanctuary to criminals who seek the necessary peace and quiet to plan their crimes, they themselves can become targets. The improvement of international relations also strengthens international security. That is why we need to make good use of the structures in place, such as the Mediterranean dialogue and the United Nations. Contact with certain sections of the Afghan population is necessary, particularly in the interests of providing relief to those in need.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which came about under the competent guidance of Mr Collins receives our full support. We would only like to adopt one single amendment from the old, socialist resolution, and replace Article 26 on Gibraltar with our own wording.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will reply quickly to some of the questions; unfortunately I have to be fairly brief because I cannot stay till the end of the sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with some further information about the convention. Several Members raised this matter. I think it is important to say, since the question was asked, that the principle of holding a convention to prepare for the IGC has, I believe, been accepted. It has also, of course, been agreed that representatives of the governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that is, a quadripartite group, will take part. This participation could take the following form: government representatives – possibly numbering 15 – 16 MEPs, 30 members of national parliaments and one Commission representative. However, I am not going to start a debate about numbers at this point. What is important to remember is that the number of participants in this convention must be reduced somewhat. It must not be exponential. Of course, we could try to please everyone, but then we would end up with a convention that was not viable. I believe we have to remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council will, no doubt, or, at least, that seems the most likely road, appoint a president, assisted by a bureau made up of at least one member of each component of the convention and assisted by a secretariat. The convention's brief would not be to adopt a final text but, at this stage – I think that answers Mr Barón Crespo's question as to whether these are proposals or whether these are options – simply to decide whether we are in favour of options rather than proposals, leaving it, of course, to the bodies concerned to choose from among these options, since options are never more than variations on proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not embracing any one point of view: I am simply describing things as they are. If it was just up to me, believe me we would go much further than proposals. We would be more radical. However, I simply have to adjust to toeing the presidency's line… So I am telling you what I believe I have to tell you for the sake of transparency. I can do no more.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention should become operational as soon as possible, during the Spanish Presidency, that is, during the first half of 2002. Let me also touch on two questions relating to this convention: it is important that you remember them but also that you can discuss them and make your views on the subject known.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important to gain the support of the candidate countries. We saw a fairly strong convergence of views in Genval on the need to involve the candidate countries in the convention. Although, in effect, we are moving towards giving them a status and right of say there, obviously we still have to define the precise procedures for their representation. Here, the presidency is putting forward three possible formulas: representation modelled from the outset on that of the Member States, namely one representative of each government and two members of each national parliament – that is conceivable; or one representative per country for the duration of the convention's activities; or, the third formula, progressive representation, consisting of a single representative until the accession treaty has been signed, then representation in line with that of the Member States after the signature. Representatives of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions could also be invited as observers. Those are the ideas now on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">The next question is how to involve civil society. On the whole, the idea of a civil forum was well received by the delegations. Nevertheless, some questions came up about the composition of this forum, that is, the selection of representatives of civil society – its organisational procedures and the nature of its links with the convention, which could, for example, take the form of hearings or a variety of other formulas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the presidency's view, this forum could take either of two forms. Either it could be like an enlarged assembly, in which case one would need to define its exact composition, role and modus operandi; or it could be a structured network, made up of organisations representing civil society, established at European level. The organisations making up that network would be kept officially informed of the activities of the convention and their written contributions would form part of the official documentation forwarded to members of the convention. They would be heard by the convention, in accordance with procedures to be defined, and, where appropriate, they could also be consulted by the convention on specific issues. If that option were adopted, it would probably be advisable to appoint a coordinator at political level, who could be chosen either by the Laeken European Council or by the convention itself.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the additional information I wanted to give you on the convention and you are, of course, welcome to come back to us with any ideas this might suggest to you or inspire in you, since that is the purpose of this kind of exchange of views. I am entirely open to any comments, ideas or suggestions on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members raised the issue of security in Brussels, so I will address their concern. I do not think there are any difficulties in principle, except for one aspect where we do come up against certain problems – I will endeavour to analyse this matter and take a closer look – namely the question of unconditional access to Belgian territory. I do believe this could pose a number of problems. That aside, it looks as though we can certainly reach an agreement fairly soon. I promise I will discuss it with the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers immediately after my return so that I can give you practical answers to your questions as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight something that has emerged from our debates and to which I too am paying close attention. If we take a whole range of measures to combat terrorism effectively, they will necessarily – and we must not pretend otherwise – involve the risk of taking measures that curtail freedoms. Mr Barón Crespo said so and Mr Lannoye also drew our attention to it. I have heard statements in this Chamber that show that some people have not entirely understood this: for instance, if I had to translate Mr Berthu's programme into action, it is clear that this would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms, which would have nothing to do, let me say, with the quality of life, with the democratic quality of our societies. That is the way it is, that is my opinion and I am sharing it with you. I think we must be very watchful here, for this really is an important issue. We cannot bring back the olden days on the pretext of fighting terrorism. I think that would be very dangerous, so I am not in favour of it. I believe the difficulty we will keep encountering will be, precisely, how to evaluate our margin for manoeuvre constantly. But let us please not give in to a security phobia, because sooner or later we would all end up as victims and that would be democracy's loss.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye and several others made a most important point in relation to our foreign policy and I entirely agree with him here: the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our friends. Of course, I agree with him. It is true that, under cover of this kind of consensual coalition, necessarily based on immediate needs and, admittedly, to some extent also on feelings that are justified, it might well be tempting to overlook, to look away from or to forget certain aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was yesterday, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that I was asked whether I had put any questions to my interlocutors about State terrorism. I think we must not, indeed, lose sight of that aspect in considering our approach, our European commitment and our values. It is true that we will have to be very vigilant here too; in other words, sometimes we must not forget that countries, organisations and bodies that form part of the coalition should also, to some extent, render account for some of their own practices, forms of behaviour and policies. I therefore agree that we must avoid any kind of naive optimism in this respect and not forget to continue to fight for and campaign for a democratic society wherever possible in the world. I therefore agree that we must strengthen the role of the International Criminal Court. As time goes by, we come to realise that it is absolutely crucial to have that vital tool at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked whether I am in favour of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into a constitution. You all know my views on this. Unfortunately, I do not think everybody is quite ready for it yet. Nevertheless, I believe that there are all sorts of arguments that can be put forward and that we must, therefore, pursue this debate. We will get there in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect on which I was questioned was the danger of curtailing freedoms. It is true that if we take a range of measures – Members have referred to the freezing of assets and various other measures – we must ensure that, however urgent, they are accompanied by a systematic evaluation process, preferably conducted soon after their adoption, whatever their nature. I think that it will, of course, be necessary for urgent measures to be re-evaluated fairly early on and fairly regularly. We must avoid a practice often seen in some countries – and I know this happens in Belgium – where temporary measures are still being applied 50 years later. So I support those who call for guarantees. In the event of urgent measures, we must indeed lay down a procedure of regular re-evaluation of those measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I basically agree with the ideas and concerns that have been expressed. Mr Dupuis spoke of the effectiveness of the secret services. I must admit that I know little about the secret services, since they are secret. I suppose that, from that point of view, they certainly are effective. I would simply appeal for more regular exchanges of information, deeper integration and closer coordination. I think others will agree with me on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I also replied to Mr Dupuis on the question of the risk of encouraging State terrorism or, at any rate, concealing certain facts about certain countries. I also agree that we must not abandon our action; we must persevere and continue trying to persuade certain countries to move towards democracy. We must not conceal that aspect or pretend the problem no longer exists in certain Arab countries. We must nevertheless continue to bring it up. I, personally, am convinced that we must strengthen political dialogue wherever we can, a political dialogue without taboos. I think it is quite possible to impose that dialogue in our relations. It is a minimum condition and, during my visit to Iran, for example, we agreed to set up a European Union-Iran group, which would have human rights questions as the only item on its agenda. This was accepted. We definitely need to take more initiatives of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I believe I have answered as fully as possible although I may well have omitted some aspects. Let me say, however, that, in general, I broadly share the concerns you expressed. I heard them clearly. In any case, I undertake to pass them on to the quarters concerned. I will do my utmost to transmit faithfully the information, ideas, criticisms and suggestions Parliament has offered me today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 21 September initiated the forthcoming review of our fundamental concepts. Since 9 November 1989 Europe has known that the cold war is over; but since 11 September 2001 the world has known that this cold war is over and it is now time to form global alliances against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the right to speak will go to those who can demonstrate their full solidarity with the United States and commit themselves unreservedly to this fight against terrorism. But that also means forbidding any sideslipping within our own ranks, for neither obscurantism nor fanaticism are permissible weapons in the fight against terrorism. We will also have to inquire into the root causes. The European Union knows that not all acts of terrorism are the consequence of poverty, but frustration and humiliation do feed terrorism. We must, therefore, review our development policy again. We must cancel the developing countries' debt. We must resume our work on light arms trafficking. We must urge everybody to play their part in the multilateral structures. Within our institutions, we must give ourselves the means to prevent all forms of conflict, for they are also a source of tension. I do not believe this is the moment to drop one of Parliament's initiatives, namely the prevention centre, which we are now told may be under threat. The European Council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead. To mention only a few issues, let us turn first to the question of the financing of terrorism. Yes, the Union put itself in a position where it could fight the Talibans' money and freeze their assets, thanks to the regulation of 4 July 2001. Some European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, have already frozen these assets. Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative. Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us on what basis the Commission envisages the revision of that annex. It is an important question because this is the first time Parliament has been consulted on measures of this kind. Then there is the fight against money laundering, the fight against tax havens; we will have to give new impetus to all these tasks on which the European Union has embarked.</p>
<p class="contents">These upheavals have come at a moment when the European Union is entering the final stage of its transition to the euro, when it is engaged in vital projects: enlargement, but also the definition of a genuine common foreign and security policy, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. These projects will be given a strong boost, circumstances will sweep away any hesitation, force us to be resolute. But if we are to be able to seize this opportunity for Europe, Ghent will have to live up to our high expectations. I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options. On the other hand, Parliament will certainly support the Council when it comes to broadening the agenda of that convention, to asking useful questions, for instance whether we need to maintain the pillar structure. What kind of presidency will the Union have? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has acted with impressive unity and decisiveness. We can look forward to a long-term battle on several fronts, including the political and the legal fronts, with a sensitive balance regarding respect for legal rights. In terms of the long view politically and economically, we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN.</p>
<p class="contents">It is gratifying that the US has realised the importance of the UN and is paying its debts to that organisation. Perhaps the EU can also get the US to ratify the protocol on the International Criminal Court. Of course, we must also work in the long term to achieve peace and democracy throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ghent, enlargement will also be discussed. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes it is vital that each country be assessed on its own merits and that the principle of differentiation be genuinely upheld. That is a message I should like to send to the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, when it comes to the Convention, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the concrete explanations. However, there is still a certain amount of concern in this area. The Convention is not a debating club for talking in rather general terms about various alternatives regarding the future of Europe. The Convention is not an alibi for the Council, but a serious and democratic partner in this discussion. Regardless of its composition – I hope that the candidate countries will be given a strong role to play in this context – the Convention will contain a large number of hard-working parliamentarians who need to know that the work that is put in is taken very seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it is glaringly obvious that the summit reflects a shockingly small degree of self-knowledge, which also characterises the United States’s government. There is no understanding of the fact that there is a political background to the horrific massacres on 11 September. In keeping with this small degree of self-knowledge, at odds with the insights of international conflict researchers, alliances for combating terrorism are being entered into with the world’s most effective State-authorised terrorists. Russian genocide in Chechnya is being legitimised, and alliances entered into with oligarchies in Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, not to mention Saudi Arabia. Any intervention is legitimised in this way and, at the same time, attempts at international conflict resolution under the UN system, including the international administration of justice, are being set aside. Moreover, the adoption of new police measures is tailored to the same pattern and based on the same low level of self-knowledge. It is the end that justifies the means. In this case, the means will deprive us of the very democracies we are supposed to be defending. I believe it will subsequently be possible to say, ‘The operation was a success, but the patient died.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see these resolutions overall in a positive light. We must, though, be able to expect a rapid start to be made on putting them into effect. I also expect the Union at last to embrace the possibilities already open to it; that the Member States will at last comply with their obligations and supply the necessary information to Europol in The Hague; and that the counter-terrorist Conventions will at last be brought into force.</p>

<p class="contents">What I look for from the Summit is that new projects will be called into being, such as intensive cooperation between Europol and the United States security services and the networking of police databases, ranging from Europol to Schengen via Olaf, so that these might be used against terrorism; that Eurojust should become the reality to which Mr Poettering has just referred, working closely with Europol; and that Europol should be developed in the direction of the first pillar, with authority to conduct investigations; and that the intergovernmental level should be abandoned in favour of the European in closely circumscribed areas of organised crime.</p>

The shock we felt at the inconceivable level of violence reached by terrorism must now give way to a practical endeavour to provide Europe with the political and institutional tools it needs to play a role combating terrorism and working towards peace and justice in the world. We therefore welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September in the field of judicial cooperation and home affairs and on combating money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this tragic backdrop, the decision of the Italian government and the majority supporting it to make changes to the judicial cooperation treaty with Switzerland appears even more serious and irresponsible, changes to its own code of criminal procedure which are in direct conflict with the commitments made at the extraordinary Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council. This law would mean that evidence gathered abroad could not be used in court proceedings and that, since this measure applies retrospectively, it would jeopardise hundreds of trials which are currently in progress, nullifying evidence already established. It is this kind of decision which made the Public Prosecutor of Geneva say<span class="bold"> </span>that this law is a disaster for international justice and that, in twelve years of judicial cooperation with countries throughout the world, he has never, ever seen rules like this adopted. Since I feel that this is not the right place to express an opinion, I call upon the Commission, the Council and the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to ascertain whether this measure is in line with the decisions of the extraordinary Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our initial response, our initial reaction must be to switch off the psychological ‘emergency’ mode and get a grip on our agenda.

<p class="contents">It is in this sense that the fight against terrorism must be seen as part of a series of structural operations. In the area of air safety, for example, we must proceed on two levels: on the one hand, there is an urgent need for a revision of the Regulation establishing the European Air Safety Authority, extending its responsibilities to include accident prevention and – if we can call it that – terrorism prevention; on the other, we need incisive action from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to ensure that the rules we are seeking to adopt for Europe become rules which are binding upon the whole world.</p>

The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible. European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty. Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty. Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks. It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended. That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community. His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting. These remarks, then, must be withdrawn. We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them.</p>

Its one dream seemed to be comfort and peace. Suddenly the shock of the brutal terrorist attacks in New York profoundly shook its confidence and its hedonism. Europe suddenly felt vulnerable and unprepared. After all, its hard-won fundamental freedoms were being threatened by mysterious terrorist networks, which nonetheless appeared to be dominated by Islamist religious proselytism. This violent and anti-modernist proselytism is anti-Western by definition. However, this does not authorise cultural cretinism and historic ignorance leading to an abusive fusion between Islam and the aberrant, irrational and sectarian assertions of the perpetrators of the attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not only the United States, the target of these sinister attacks, which was put to the test. Europe was also put to the test and the European Union has to do some deep soul-searching. In the immediate aftermath, still in shock, the European Union proved equal to the occasion at the Brussels Summit. It was fast, clear and precise in its emergency responses. But, now what? Europe cannot in future act in such a spontaneous, opportunistic and superficial way. Europe cannot be a plaything of destiny, a destiny plotted by others. What has been established in Ghent and Laeken is that Europe should completely rethink its project and its role in light of the new world order and adopt a clear guideline for the troubled times ahead. Without becoming unduly pessimistic about the human condition, Europe must be less ingenuous in the face of the dangers that will arise in the future. Europe must unite more strongly on the economic level, the political level, the military level and in its internal security. That is obvious. But how is it to do so? What are its priorities beyond fighting relentlessly against terrorism? What are the new aims of the European project? Will enlargement continue to take place on the same terms? Will it not be necessary, from now on, to speed up the accession of, for example, Turkey to the European Union? Will it not be the most elementary common sense to give absolute priority to the strategy for the Mediterranean and provide new impetus to partnerships with the Muslim countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention of the coalition, led by the United States, to eradicate terrorism deserves the support of the European democracies in particular. We welcome the measures taken by the European Council since the attacks and we are playing our part in putting them swiftly into effect. However, let us also be vigilant in ensuring that the European Union does not, in its haste, take steps which exceed the current needs. In some cases, these measures should be renewable and temporary.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week in Rome I and my colleagues had a series of meetings in connection with the reaction to terrorism. We met the exiled Afghan King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, who ruled for 40 years until 1973 and who in 1964 introduced free elections and a free media and brought women into politics. We affirm our support for the central role he is willing to play in the return to democracy of his country. We urge the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to take up immediate contacts with the king.</p>
<p class="contents">We also had meetings with Italian ministers and were able to express our thanks for the additional deployment of troops in the Balkans, allowing British special forces to be deployed in another theatre.</p>
<p class="contents">We also discussed at the Vatican the values shared by all faiths, including Islam, concerning the integrity of human beings, their rights and the universal belief in the peaceful resolution of disputes, whether in the context of democracy or other systems.</p>

We stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the global coalition against terrorism, although we have little advice to offer about the technical, policing or military measures which will need to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can do, however, is to speak with perhaps greater authority about the political preconditions to success. No campaign of this sort and no war, at least no war in which democracies have taken part, has ever been able to create the necessary alliance of nations – because that is the alliance which counts, not the alliance of governments – without offering a vision of a better world at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, we need to point out yet again that we support all the democratic regimes and, more to the point, that we reject any tyrannical regimes which may promise to help fight specific terrorist organisations but which, in the long term, work with secret services which collaborate with them like terrorist recruiting offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Socially, we need to recognise that environmental catastrophes, epidemics, poverty and misery threaten the security of the world and need to be dealt with as threats which are every bit as serious as terrorism. We need to state that, in a globalised society, our wealth and our military power do not offer the man in the street any security. The only realistic solution is to find ways of taking the tension out of social and ethnic fights, of reconciling all men of good faith, irrespective of nationality, religion, social position or ideology, in fact everyone who is determined to put an end to the scourges which inflict mankind and which, even if they do not result in terrorism, prepare the ground for terrorism and we need to remove this ground if we are to guarantee the security of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when fresh threats are being made to American targets in Italy, it is the European Union’s duty to take the lead in defending these values, which apply to all citizens. That is why, while I support the decisions taken by the Council at Brussels, I feel that it is vital that, as we implement the inevitable specific military initiatives, we must step up political and economic initiatives as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I cannot remain silent regarding a controversial point raised in this Chamber: Mrs Napoletano’s call for the Italian Parliament to be monitored by the Council is irrelevant and devoid of any legal basis. I would remind Mrs Napoletano and Mr Barón Crespo that the Italian Parliament is sovereign, like all the parliaments in consolidated democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements of the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are, as far as we are concerned, extremely serious and unacceptable, for they amount to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State of the European Union. And before making pronouncements on legislative affairs such as international letters rogatory, with which he is clearly unfamiliar, I would suggest that he read Article 3 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed right here in Strasbourg, where he will find answers to his unfounded concerns: I would advise Mrs Napoletano, who also is clearly unfamiliar with this provision, to read it as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, in any case, be appropriate for the Chairman of a Parliamentary Group, and also for those holding positions of responsibility in the European institutions – I refer to the absent Mr Michel – not to make statements either of approval or condemnation in this Chamber on the internal affairs of a Member State. Rather, we would like to hear what action the Belgian government intends to adopt, at last, to ensure the safety of the thousands of people who work within the European Parliament in Brussels, especially the staff based permanently on that site. Declarations of intent must be followed by practical action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The following are examples of the proposals which receive my full support: developing international judicial instruments, freezing the funding of terrorist networks and exchanging intelligence in conjunction with the US by setting up an anti-terrorist unit within Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have spoken with one voice over the past three weeks, embarrassing slips by Commissioner Bolkestein and Prime Minister Berlusconi apart. This suggests that European cooperation, both internally and externally, is growing up fast.</p>
<p class="contents">The weapon of new terrorism is fear and disruption, and hunger for power. An effective line of attack protecting the international rule of law must spring from a worldwide coalition against terrorism under the aegis of the UN and on the basis of UN resolutions. Provided that that coalition is based on international rule of law principles and not, as was the case in the past with the Taliban, by financing future enemies, for that is misguided <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>. I support a worldwide dignified response, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, proportional across the legal, political, diplomatic, financial, military and economic fields, whereby an appeal is made for extreme caution with regard to innocent lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the long-term perspective, particularly now. Let there be no doubt about this: the direct causes of terrorism do not lie in creed or poverty. In the climate of globalisation, there are certainly links between economic development, contrasting poverty and trade. For example, the World Bank expects that, as a result of the terrorist attacks, economic growth in the developing countries will drop from 5% to 2%. The expected effects are enormous, with ten million additional people under the poverty line and between twenty to forty thousand more children under the age of five who will die. If we fail to formulate adequate responses in the face of this harsh reality, we in Europe will be applying double standards. Investing in worldwide security means taking safety measures, but it also calls for international solidarity, which is a basis for international cooperation and, along with this, a basis for the worldwide coalition against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It resorts to violence and terror in an effort to impose its views by force. At the same time it attacks the very core of democratic systems, namely our system of individual and collective freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorists are aware that our democratic societies are more open and consequently more vulnerable. They therefore resort to the advantages offered by globalisation. It follows that the response to the terrorist phenomenon must likewise be a response at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on convening the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels and on placing terrorism on the agenda for the next Council. I think congratulations are also due to the European Commission on the initiatives it has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis that there is no good terrorism as against bad terrorism, I believe that terrorists the world over need to be aware that there will be international resistance to put an end to this scourge. I also feel that it is important for us all to appreciate that the existing balance between an individual’s right to safety and the principles of legality and individual freedom which underpin our system of values cannot be altered. It is very important for us to understand that the horrendous attacks perpetrated on 11 September must not result in the eventual dilution of the culture of freedom in democratic countries.</p>

I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism, but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty, exploitation and oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas. We will not defeat terrorism, whether it be national terrorism, whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind, unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror. We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an argument for business as usual. It is an argument for avoiding the trap set for us by terrorism. We have to be careful also not to fall into the trap of seeing Muslims as an enemy. The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi. It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age, particularly when the country is Italy, which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas. I would add my voice to others' condemnations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is how do we respond? The very best response, apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take, is to defend our ideas of freedom, of democracy, of justice and of ending exploitation. This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world. Yes, we must resolutely declare war on all forms of terrorism, from wherever it comes, the IRA, ETA, the assassins of Claude Erignac, Prefect of Corsica, Osama Bin Laden and his clique and all the others, but without making the stupid and suicidal mistake of lumping them all together. Our capacity to take in terrorists is now beyond the limit; it is probable that the insane attacks of 11 September were prepared in Europe. So, let us spring to action and pool our resources, our activities, our objectives in the field of intelligence, justice, security and defence and let us be implacable towards the terrorists, their networks, their support structures, their dirty money. Yes, the Commissioner was quite right to refer to the obligation to get results!</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity with our friends, our American allies, does not imply mindless alignment. With its tried and tested experience of the world, Europe can and must play a specific role here. Others place hope in us, await us, call on us, alas, too often without response. Let us not disappoint them any longer. In the Middle East, a constant source of tension, the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states – Israel and Palestine – with absolute security guarantees for both. Even the Americans are, for the first time, considering this obvious arrangement. It is up to us to initiate the process of opening the doors. Let us finally realise that the post-Yalta organisation of the world needs to be rethought to take account of the incredible developments since the last war: the emergence of nuclear powers, whether official or not, the fall of the Berlin wall, more than a billion Muslims around the world desperately seeking recognition and respect, new giants like India, limitless technological developments in every field, developments that are accessible only to the few, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor. Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised, respected rather than despised, involved rather than ignored. There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe’s response must amount to more than the solidarity called for earlier in the House. It must be an active response, defending specific values. I am not referring, as Mr Berlusconi might, to Western values or to Christian civilisation. I have in mind genuine democratic values. These must be defended wherever the freedom to do so exists. Where it does not, they must be established and nurtured. Success can only be guaranteed through long-term support by the governments committed to this fight.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the serious threat to humanity terrorism represents, we are called upon to take action and to get it right. We must abide by the rules when taking action against those who have no rules. We have to get it right, but getting it right cannot in this context mean taking spectacular action. Getting it right has to mean identifying those responsible and dealing with the key figures. It involves destroying their networks and preventing them from organising new ones. All this takes time, and calls for cooperation between judges and police at international level, together with mutual political trust between governments. It will be a long and difficult process but believe me, it is the only way to defend democracy from fanaticism and barbarism.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine common foreign security and defence policy for the European Union is called for. The Union also needs a common approach to legal and home affairs. The European search and arrest warrant will be an essential element of this but by no means the only one.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this joint European action requires us to set ourselves high standards. No European leader should jeopardise the joint response, as Mr Berlusconi’s government has just done. The legislation it has recently endorsed is diametrically opposed to the approach adopted by this House. It is also in opposition to the 21 September Council resolution we all applauded here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put some questions to the Council and the Commission. What action will the Council take to ensure that it speaks with one voice, as Mr Michel was saying this morning? Also, how does it intend to deal with that thorn in its flesh, namely the Berlusconi doctrine? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first question is the need to find effective means to combat terrorism, which do not necessarily entail legislative reform on matters of security. It is worth recalling clearly that it is not effective, and never has been in democracy, to curtail freedoms in order to fight the enemies of democracy itself. Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere. It is not only the lack of legislation at national or European level, or the lack of coordinated policing at international level. The problem has much to do both with hesitancy and weakness in the fight against terrorism, which manifest themselves in laxity towards activities of a terrorist nature, in the hope that terrorist acts would always be carried out in the country next door, or in the slow deterioration of methods of defence and security, police forces, information services and armed forces. European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot, of course, talk loudly about terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns political awareness of the times in which we live. If we denounce what happened in New York and Washington merely as a criminal act, we will from the start be limiting the scope, the meaning and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism. What happened is in reality an act of war, no doubt of a war different to previous wars but, unfortunately, all wars are different to previous wars. They are usually more deadly, affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre. They are increasingly total wars.</p>
<p class="contents">To classify what happened as an act of war is not a mere question of semantics. It has had major implications, starting with the right of the nation or nations affected to respond with military actions, if necessary, in relation to the country or countries shown to be responsible for supporting or carrying out terrorist acts. At present this is a basic condition for effectively fighting terrorism, which cannot attain the magnitude of the attack of 11 September without the support of one or more States. Unfortunately, there has been little discussion on this subject, but it is necessary to know the position of the Council, Parliament and the Commission concerning the need for military intervention against States which perpetrate or support terrorist acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, however, all democrats throughout the world have realised that this open society is worth defending and that we have to work together to combat terrorism and lack of freedom. US President George W. Bush has therefore, to his credit, been successful in creating global coalitions for freedom. The UN, NATO and the EU have acted vigorously in this common struggle. The common will in the European Union must manifest the ideals of the open society. Let us not panic and introduce legislation which eliminates the principles of a state governed by law. Do not let the protection of human rights be seen as incompatible with the fight against terrorism. Do not let the prevailing mood be exploited for the purpose of closing borders or increasing prejudices between people. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, make sure that Ghent is used to strengthen the EU’s ability to promote the open society.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade is increasing links and understanding between the people of Europe and the rest of the world. It is therefore disgraceful that certain countries in the EU are at present outside the common currency, which is one of our best tools for increasing partnership. It is therefore also foolhardy of the Belgian Presidency to play the anti-globalisation game by bringing up the Tobin Tax, which would directly counteract economic recovery and increased trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe’s best long-term contribution to a more open, freer and safer world will be in terms of obtaining concrete results now on the reuniting of Western and Eastern Europe through enlargement. You must not only handle an emergency and increasingly clear threats, but you must also fulfil the EU’s most important and historic task.

We must combine foreign and home affairs policy so as to take into account the worldwide nature of the enemy and their presence in our towns and cities. Mrs Carlsson is quite right; we must not do it at the expense of abandoning the liberal state under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is that of how the causes of terrorism around the world are to be fought. We know very well that none of these three aspects can any longer be coped with by the Nation State. Rather, it is only as a European community<span class="italic"> </span>that we can get to grips with them and, to some extent, only together with the Atlantic Alliance and with our friends in North America. I believe that we cannot be content with mere slogans, but, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that we must, through the post-Nice process and by pressing on, in Ghent and Laeken, with enlargement and so extending the zone of stability, create the practicalities, instruments and preconditions for, in time, casting what would have been mere slogans into durable forms enabling us to comply with these requirements. It is for this reason that the preparation for Laeken, with a rationally conceived Convention, is of such decisive significance. We must see clearly that in these fields too, technology is extraordinarily important. We must ensure – and I am sure that you will take the right direction in your role as Belgian Presidency – a Convention that is workable and represents the necessary legitimisation, on the basis of which to present to the Heads of State and Government a document that will facilitate the really great reform of the European Union over and above the agenda laid down in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me a final word to the chairman of the PSE Group. There is a difference between a person who is a Prime Minister and one who, like Mr Nielson, is a Commissioner and thereby subject to the European Parliament's immediate right of control. If someone is directly subject to the European Parliament, it must be possible to express clear criticism of him here in this House and to call him to account if he talks nonsense, as he has done.</p>

If we close our eyes and think of the impact this situation will have on millions of people, we, as the European Union, should really take action. I believe it is of the utmost importance for the Council too – and I am addressing Mrs Neyts at this point – together with Parliament, to consider the question as to what we can do to make more resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if our humanitarian aid efforts do not run smoothly, we will create a new breeding ground for the Bin Ladens of this world. It is therefore crucial to get it right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to denounce the statements made by Commissioner Bolkestein. It is now the umpteenth time that he has acted beyond his remit. He makes statements and gives an analysis in the <span class="italic">Volkskrant</span> of 29 September in which he says that the Arab world is indignant and feels weak vis-à-vis the West, partly as a result of the Gulf War. But they are quite welcome to supply oil, he says. Mr President, this analysis is not shared by Mr Patten. Mr Bolkestein goes on to say that the EU’s asylum policy is not coming off the ground. In my opinion, that is a direct attack on Mr Vitorino’s policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Mr Barnier to consult the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the matter of Mr Bolkestein adhering to his remit, being the internal market. We cannot end up in a situation where the Commission as a whole would ultimately be harmed because it is judged on statements by Mr Bolkestein. That is inopportune under these circumstances. I think it is useful and necessary for the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Mr Bolkestein to hold a discussion, with a view to the latter concentrating on his own task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the debate on terrorism is concerned, I share the views of Messrs Van den Berg, De Rossa and others who have recommended a broader approach. But since I was absent during the last debate, I would like to come back to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the debate on terrorism, I would like to add that we in Europe too must prevent grounds for frustration from developing or continuing to exist. This is also relevant to enlargement. Commissioner, it is vital for the political criteria of democracy, human rights and rights of minorities to be just as much respected as the quantitative aspects of enlargement. With enlargement will come a number of small countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore wonder what, in future, the place and rights of the constitutional regions will be, some of which see themselves as nations equivalent to others that have their own state. They must be given their place. Not only Flanders, but also Scotland, Wales, the Basque Country, Galicia and others spring to mind. I am thinking of all those constitutional regions which might feel obliged to apply for Member State status, simply because Member States are the only States acknowledged within Europe. In other words, if we fail in a future debate to give regions and nations a place in Europe, we in fact further separatism. That is not what I want. I would like regions to be able to help build a federal Europe, a federal Europe that is often curbed by the Member States themselves. I would therefore urge you to include a paragraph on regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, at the close of this debate let me thank all the speakers, although I will not be able to reply to each one individually in the few minutes that remain. Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, that I was touched by the support several of you gave to the work we are doing during these difficult and serious times, side by side with the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the most important issue, which almost all speakers addressed, the fight against terrorism, let me remind you of the spirit in which we are undertaking it. We, and in particular my colleague and friend Mr Vitorino, take account in our activities of the important work done by Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs under its chairman Mr Watson. In fact we were working with that committee this morning on the final text submitted to you on freezing the assets of organisations linked to terrorism. At this point, I can confirm that the Commission, like the Council, is prepared to take on board any suggestions or proposals from Parliament where at all possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To echo Mr Poettering's concern, let me repeat what I said in my statement this morning about the fight against terrorism. That fight certainly involves all the states; in no case can it be reduced to some kind of conflict between the different civilisations of the world. As Mrs Béres and Mr Salafranca said, we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out – in response to a number of speakers, Mr Lannoye, Mr Michel and Mr Di Lello – that we are most concerned during our activities with steering the best possible course between the need for freedom and the need for security. Perhaps, as Mr Michel advised, it would be a good idea to carry out regular, careful evaluations to ensure that we remain on course.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully to the recommendations of several Members, in particular Mr Collins, who called for determined and vigorous measures; I also noted the encouragement offered by Mr Berthu, calling on us to continue to work towards an objective that has clearly emerged since Amsterdam and since Tampere: a common judicial area, with the necessary cooperation between Member States and between all the services – and let me say to Mr Dupuis that I certainly mean all the services – and the necessary harmonisation or communitarisation in some areas. Nor am I forgetting, just as you must not forget, that in Amsterdam and Tampere we also looked at ways of tackling illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on terrorism, as part of our collective action, we, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must implement our common foreign policy by establishing a political dialogue, by preventing and stabilising all the regional conflicts, by giving marked support to development. A number of you discussed this in relation to long-term action. I am thinking here of Mr McMillan-Scott and Mr van Velzen. And then, of course, in the shorter term, there are the support and cooperation measures to help the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, looking at this serious challenge of fighting terrorism, let me emphasise what Mr Klaus Hänsch and, in a sense, Mr Nassauer said a moment ago. We are facing a moment of truth and it is likely that the European Union will emerge stronger from this crisis in terms of the values and rationale of the European project. As I said myself, it is also likely that we will have to step up the pace and find additional reasons for taking this European project further.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, even if it is difficult to explain this to you at this time of the day and with all this hubbub, I believe there is a link between, on the one hand, the political lessons we have to learn from this crisis and from the tragedy of New York and Washington, which tell us to speed up, to intensify, to prove once again the value of European integration and, on the other hand, that broad debate that began after Nice and is due to conclude in 2002. There is a link with the activities the convention will have to undertake. Speaking of that convention…</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have tried to be as precise as possible and to keep to the speaking time. I will come to a close soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, turning to that convention, may I, following on from Mr Michel, establish that there is a link between the political debate that is beginning and the new dimension, the new gravity it has acquired as a result of the lessons we have learned from these tragic attacks. I believe that the candidate countries must be given a place, the best possible place in this convention. I believe the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions must be given a place as active observers. I believe, as Mr Belder also suggested, that we must work as quickly as possible to bring this convention and the IGC that will conclude it to a close no later than the beginning of the year 2004. I believe we will have to find a structured link between the citizens' forum with civil society and the activities of the convention. Lastly, I believe that this convention must not confine itself to setting out the options but must be authorised or take it upon itself to make proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, addressing Mr Bonde, I do not share his fear about the convention. I do not see why he should have any fears about its activities. We have to learn from earlier weaknesses or failures. I am speaking of the weaknesses of the intergovernmental method; indeed we saw its limitations before Amsterdam and before Nice. We are fortunate to have time between now and 2004. We are also fortunate to be able to work more openly with the four institutions, the four sources of legitimacy, in order to make the future Intergovernmental Conference a success. So I believe that through that convention, the Ghent Summit, followed by the Laeken Summit, will confirm both our political ambition and our use of more transparent methods.</p>

The acoustics in this Chamber are very, very poor. This is not a new thing, though. To add to that, we have been getting a terrible noise out of the loudspeaker today, which interferes with everything. Because of the noise from the loudspeaker, we cannot hear anything. Somebody must do something about this sound system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
