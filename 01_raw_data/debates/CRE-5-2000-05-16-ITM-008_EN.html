<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I hope Parliament will excuse me if shortly after making a brief presentation I have to leave, but this is, as Parliament knows, very much the collective work of the RELEX Commissioners as a whole and very much the shared work of my colleague, Commissioner Nielson and myself. Commissioner Nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise. The function I have to attend is a joint meeting of two committees which was specially arranged to discuss a number of external assistance issues so I hope Parliament will be understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the White Paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flagships, for an overall reform process. People occasionally get a little bored when one talks about internal procedures but what they should recognise is what we are discussing in these particular proposals: ways in which, first of all, we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and, secondly, ways in which we can change the image of the European Union around the world. All of us have, alas, experienced too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the credit for what we are trying to do on behalf of Europe's taxpayers, we get blamed for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly. I hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is. We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years. That has been driven by events and by political pressures; a recognition of the responsibilities we should discharge in Central and Eastern Europe – the recognition which that triggered of our responsibilities in the Mediterranean. It is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the Mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 1990. Then there is the Balkans crisis where the attempts to put in place a common foreign and security policy are being particularly tested. While our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly, staff resources have failed to keep pace. The Commission has 2.9 staff for every EUR 10 million that we manage. That compares with an average figure about twice that for Member States – the figure is 5.7 but it goes as high as 9 for some Member States and 4.2 for the World Bank. One of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance offices which has been much criticised by Parliament and by the Court of Auditors on the grounds of weak monitoring and a lack of political control. It is worth noting that we have spent about EUR 170 million a year on the 80 technical assistance offices which is equivalent to the cost of 800 staff working for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A consequence of all this is that the SCR today has over EUR 21 billion in outstanding commitments awaiting payments. That is an embarrassingly large figure. I do not blame the staff of the SCR who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them. They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures. They have also had to operate against a background of Member States second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make. We have brought forward in the document, which has now been made public, our proposals for dealing with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members will know, over the years Parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should externalise the management of our overseas aid. That remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework. However my principal concern at the moment is not how we get from A to Z – that often seems rather easier than getting from A to B. What we have to do – whatever the long term objective may be is – to find better ways of managing our external assistance straightaway. We have put forward a number of proposals. We have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the RELEX Commissioners share responsibility for programming – we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation – we think the present split has not worked well. What we propose to do is to create a new implementation body replacing the SCR which we think should be called Europe Aid. It would be initially an office under a board made up of all the External Relations Commissioners though, as I say, the option of moving to externalisation in the longer term remains on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and, where possible, to national authorities in the field. We have proposed special treatment for the pre-accession strategy: humanitarian assistance and macro-financial assistance with fully integrated management. That means, for example, transferring the residual SCR functions for PHARE to the Directorate-General for Enlargement. We have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects. We are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the Court of Auditors to explain our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go on for very much longer, except to say this: where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office, Europe Aid, rather better in the future than we have managed in the past? We have to take our turn with others in the Commission in arguing our corner in the peer group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively. We may, as a result, present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the 2001 budget proposals in September. That is for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple point I want to make is this: we cannot go on as we have. In my judgement it is simply not an option. We have to do better. We are not bidding for a bigger empire. The budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of European Union external aid programmes. However, my only aim is to put the Commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently. I have to say very bluntly to Parliament that there are two possibilities: either the budgetary authority agrees with our ideas and will then try to implement them from 2001, or else, in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently, we will be obliged to propose very large cuts. We cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes. We have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world, otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be receiving our help to enable them to read and write or live a better and healthier life or create the institutions of good governance in their communities. They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union's reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure this will be a long debate. I am sure that Parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months. However, my impression after a few months in this job is that Parliament wants as badly as the Commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes. Is it not the case now that this proposal, taking away so much from DG Development as it does, is likely to make my prediction come true?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying, I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in "The Times" this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid. I have to say, Commissioners, that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest. I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities. We also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy. We have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or EuropeAid or whatever SCR is going to be called. My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer. Commissioner Patten will be chairman, reflecting the position he already has at the head of the table being the ultimate coordinator of all RELEX Commissioners' activities. We are in a sense structuring the political roles that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that I think it really does have a chance of functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency. One is what I have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation. The other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in DG Development. The role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes, including those in DG RELEX, is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined. All in all, I think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last July.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also concentrate a lot of attention among all RELEX Commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering. We have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering. What we are doing here will be part of that change. We also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem. The reality, because of the way we are organised in the Commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic. This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job. Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible. We have to make the point as clearly as Commissioner Patten just did which means that we want those resources. We have commitments, we have an agreement with 71 ACP states, we have the Member States backing that and accepting the next ninth European Development Fund. All this is part of the promises we have made already, so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job. But how to do it – this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job. This is the situation as we see it. We do not want to invest our own role as Commissioners in fighting a losing battle. We want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Parliament is aware of this, we will offer our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to ask a question, since I have not had time to study the document at length. What will happen to humanitarian aid?</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that the Union’s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue – we talk in this context of a ‘continuum’ – so that development policies can be carried out. Otherwise, we may see a repetition of what is happening in Mozambique at the moment: clearly, humanitarian aid was removed, ECHO disappeared, development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore, violence may erupt once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this ‘continuum’ I would like to know whether, as has been the case until now, ECHO will be an office dependent on the Commission, but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see, and that is the eradication of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I actually wanted to put my question to him. But I think that Mr Nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague’s side and he also said that both Commissioners were responsible for the proposal. Mr Nielson, of course we here in Parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the European Union. That goes without saying. But we had all agreed that what the Commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us. When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, I find that highly displeasing. It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts. That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us. I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner, Mr Nielson.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place. EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned. It has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept. Not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about – as a rich part of the world – trying to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">Consolidating the RELEX Commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support. I am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the World Bank. But I should like to ask Commissioner Nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the House – the IFC in the World Bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding. Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves. Have they considered extending, in EuropeAid, some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the European Union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

ECHO is going to continue. This is clearly part of what we have decided. The only issue is to create a better link or bridge between the phase of humanitarian assistance and the more forward-oriented, long-term development assistance. This is a well established discussion. We want to keep ECHO more or less the way it is. I have confidence that with the new director of ECHO we are on track.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Haug I should like to make it clear that Commissioner Patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we saying this as clearly as we are, even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat? I noticed your choice of word there. We think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the manpower that we need.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other well-performing donors. This is the message. It may very well be the case that we are being misunderstood in this Parliament because, on this matter, we are definitely among friends. So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong. I realise that. But there are other elements around. We have to say it <span class="italic">à tous azimuts.</span> It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear. I do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance, but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion. Development ministers are not that unproblematic either.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of ambition defined in this field and the resources and tools that we have available to carry out the job. This is our biggest problem. We will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that, though it is right to point out the backlog, the problems and the embarrassment, it should not be forgotten that we are building roads out there, thousands of kilometres in length; we are drilling bore-holes for clean, safe water, giving millions of people access to safe drinking water every year. We are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries. We are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none, even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world. We would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped. That is not the case. We have to be realistic, clear and demanding in order to enter the primary league amongst donors and not to remain where we are right now. This is the goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Deva, we will, as part of the new Suva Agreement – the successor to the Lomé Convention – be including in our activities a EUR 2.2 billion private investment facility which will be administered by the European Investment Bank at arm's length. It will deal with private partners, inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between European companies and business in the developing ACP countries. This major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about. Micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems. However, we are quite active in this field also.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Parliament for what I sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that I have heard are of a kind that I would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support. We should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
