<p class="contents">We have now reached the fourth report in the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package and in my view, these two Erika packages together can represent a considerable step forward in increasing maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The first <span class="italic">Erika</span> package addressed the issues of port state control, the classification society and double-hulled tankers. We are now discussing the first report of the second <span class="italic">Erika</span> package, which covers measures to improve traffic monitoring and information systems onboard ships, as well as to enhance risk management, especially in adverse weather. This is the objective of the directive on which we are currently working. The measures are therefore mainly preventive – and extremely important in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, traffic monitoring and information systems involve the onboard installation of transponders which automatically send data to shore. What is important here is not so much the list of what has to be sent – as we are all agreed on this – but that this data is understood among the various Member States. In other words, it is important for the computer systems, as well as the people, to be able to communicate with each other. In my view, we must pay particular attention to this aspect to ensure that this is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on the scope of transponders, which should be looked at when we review the directive. At the moment, the scope is relatively restricted. I believe that when we review the directive, we – and I am looking in the direction of the Commission – would all benefit from endeavouring to achieve a more extensive scope, possibly combined with satellite communication, by working in tandem with the IMO, and we should ensure that this system has global coverage.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point is the black box, which was already mentioned in the report by Mr Watts. We had to fight a tough battle to achieve this, of course, but now it is here. The black box is not a panacea but a very useful tool, and we must ensure that this tool is used in the area of prevention, and we must learn from near misses and accidents in order to prevent future accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are focusing our traffic monitoring efforts mainly on ships which carry a higher risk on account of their cargo and their past history. And we must also ensure that each incident – and this is a very valid point in the Commission proposal, in my view – is reported from now on, so that we are better informed of what actually happens at sea, which currently only takes place to a limited extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I want to bring up is related to the fact that the most serious accidents at sea, with major and serious implications, happen under adverse weather conditions, and concerns improved risk management in adverse weather and during storms at sea. We have managed to put forward a number of points which I believe may be helpful, and Parliament’s contribution has been considerable in this respect. The authorities must take measures when the weather conditions are adverse: keeping the captain better informed, announcing a prohibition on entering or leaving ports which is specifically tailored to each situation in each port, banning refuelling at sea, etc. However, I would still like to emphasise that, whichever way you look at it, it is the captain who is ultimately responsible for the ship. In my opinion, we have stated this clearly in Parliament and this is very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to another point, Member States have a duty of assistance to ships in distress. This is also essential in my view, and this is an example of where Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, have tightened up the original provisions. These concern ports of refuge, safe havens for ships in distress – the <span class="italic">Erika</span> proved that these are necessary – sound equipment – and for me, this not only includes station tugs but also installations that can limit pollution – timing (determining a strict period of time within which Member States must have made their measures known, namely 18 months) – Parliament added this provision – and compensation for a port or coastal point which accommodates vessels. The Commission intends to look into this and to issue a report to Parliament within three years to assess the state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone involved for their contribution and the efforts made. In my view, we have delivered a sound piece of work. I should also like to thank the offices of the Commission, and the people of the Council, as I am of the opinion that this has been an excellent and constructive team effort and we have ended up with a sound piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what is important is that we also monitor what happens, both now and as and when we complete the six measures of the two <span class="italic">Erika</span> packages. The European Parliament, or, as far as I am concerned, the rapporteurs of these various reports, must, together with the Commission, check at regular intervals what has happened, how far we have got and what the problems are we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have legislation – and I believe we have laid down sound legislation – but safety, including at sea, is man-made. In my opinion, we should invest in these people, also in the Union, the people who work on improving the monitoring of safety both at sea and on land. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">The package of measures which we are being called on to adopt today does, I think, strike the right balance and demonstrates yet again that we can only protect and improve European shipping standards by improving safety at sea and protecting both human life and the marine environment and I should like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his tireless work over a long period of time to achieve the result which we have before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's initial proposal contained positive arrangements to improve safety at sea and reduce the danger of pollution from accidents. Ships are required to use a transponder and voyage data recorders or so-called black boxes. This has since been dealt with in the Watts report, which requires ships to comply with maritime traffic systems, improvements to be made to ship-locating systems and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In turn, Parliament approved 29 amendments at first reading which, I think, improved the Commission proposal and most of which, I should point out, were subsequently adopted by the Council, which took a constructive stance. However, a number of questions have yet to be settled and I therefore think we are right – and this is the point of the nine amendments approved in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – to insist on keeping to a specific approach to point the way both to the Commission and to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment very briefly on three of these amendments. Amendment No 1 basically clarifies that a Member State may, in exceptionally poor conditions, stop a ship from entering port or even from leaving port, because ships in port sometimes represent more of a threat to safety and of pollution of the port itself. I think our Committee, the Committee on Transport, is right to assert that the decision as to whether or not the ship sails should be taken at the discretion of the captain, who must of course explain the reasons for his decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried in Amendment No 2 to take a more realistic approach to the cost of pollution or damage which the accommodating port may sustain; obviously ports will be more willing to accommodate ships in distress if they know that they will receive fair and immediate compensation for cleaning-up costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 3 basically endeavours to ensure that resources are immediately available so that the Member States can make the necessary arrangements to provide means and facilities in ports of refuge for assistance to ships, salvage and pollution response. And Mr Sterckx's proposed 18-month deadline is essential if these proposals are to become law in all the Member States of the European Union, rather than just a ‘to-do’ list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are putting in place a series of measures to ensure events like that can never happen again. We save lives and we protect the marine environment. I therefore applaud the Commission and the Commissioner for her commitment to improving the safety of our seas and the Council for its willingness to codecide with Parliament. In particular I pay tribute to the rapporteur for his determination both to strengthen and clarify an already good proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The three key elements are monitoring and information, transponders on every ship and monitoring by every maritime authority, an essential component of our package of measures – the Erika package. This will ensure that there is no hiding place for substandard ships, that all ships will be watched and monitored and that they will not escape compliance with their international obligations. That is our message to substandard ships and the flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposal dovetails with my own report on port State control. In particular the black box voyage-data recorder. As the rapporteur has said, this will enable us not just to learn from lessons but prevent problems occurring in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">We are giving real help to ships in distress to ensure that they are properly handled in emergency situations, closing a loophole in the safety chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like the rapporteur, want to ensure that this and other Erika measures are complied with. This perhaps is the greatest challenge we face as a Community. We want to ensure all this new legislation, worthy though it is, is complied with not just by the ship operators but also by the Member States themselves who, sadly, over the years, have shown a reluctance to adhere to Community law. I hope that the Erika rapporteurs together can meet the Commissioner soon to help bring forward proposals as to how best Parliament can ensure that Member States comply with their toughened obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope our amendments can be accepted in full in order to avoid codecision and to ensure this legislation, which will do so much to make our seas safer, comes on to the statute book at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for a directive as part of the second <span class="italic">Erika </span>package has focused attention on the matters that are essential for increasing safety at sea and reducing the environmental damage caused by accidents. Waterborne traffic is popular, partly because it is environmentally friendly. It is especially important for the EU’s peripheral regions and in commercial transport between the EU and non-member countries. The risk of accident has grown, however, with the increase in traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has once again adopted some proposals to improve safety that are not contained in the Council’s common position. It is particularly important to ensure there are adequate salvage facilities and equipment to deal with oil spillages in all coastal zones. Likewise, we must see to it that essential search and rescue services are properly organised. Besides tightening up the rules still further we must ensure that the decisions taken are realistic and, furthermore, feasible. It is important for the interests of all concerned, however, that the proposal is adopted swiftly and that we make real progress in matters of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the directive should be adopted and implemented swiftly it is not appropriate to wait around for the decision of the meeting of the International Maritime Organisation in December. The directive’s annexes can be amended through the comitology procedure so that they are made to accord with what the IMO has decided. This procedure allows internationally agreed deadlines to be incorporated into the directive easily and swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would furthermore like to draw your attention to the fact that decisions taken by the Union alone to raise levels of safety at sea are not enough. We need global agreements to deal with such matters as responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like him I believe that we are working towards an excellent text. Admittedly we still have a long way to go because, since the Amoco-Cádiz tragedy that everyone in Europe and particularly the people of France, can recall, no progress has been made. Quite the opposite, in fact; things have deteriorated, since oil companies have decided to withdraw from transport to avoid seeing their name on the hull of a wrecked ship, and to avoid being associated with ships that have run aground and acts of pollution. This decision had a dramatic effect, since maritime transport, oil transport had become a separate profit centre which was forced, like any other profit centre, to cut its costs, to make a profit and to survive under the pressure from those in charge, namely the oil companies. This had an undeniable effect on the quality of transport and on safety, since the average age of a ship doubled in the space of 15 years and so there is an obvious link between the average age of a ship and the number of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Parliament has a specific duty to intervene on these issues, not only because they concern the environment but also because they are transnational in nature and this is a good document that we are working towards. I would, however, like to stress one particular point. Of course, the control of illegal trafficking, data registration and identification are all well and good, but it would be quite reasonable, in the same spirit of resisting economic pressure, to ensure that the decision whether the ship leaves the port when sea conditions are difficult is not simply left to the captain alone, as he may be placed under economic pressure due to his position. Instead, the port authorities could take this decision as they can decide whether or not it is safe to set sail without having to take into account financial considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur has been very cautious. He has not gone too far at second reading, because we want rapid results, as, let us be honest, it is a long time since the <span class="italic">Erika II</span> sank. So we need to take measures without delay and I would like to point out that transponders are not only suitable for monitoring but first and foremost also for rescue purposes. So if a vessel really gets into trouble at sea and can no longer set off an adequate distress signal, it can be reached and rescued more quickly by using transponders.</p>
<p class="contents">Our requests to the Council with regard to equipping vessels with transponders and voyage data recorders are really very modest. We can only hope that the IMO will agree an accelerated timetable in the autumn, one that we can implement without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the vital thing here is for us to react more quickly, and Mr Sterckx has been kind enough to give you three years to sort out compensation for ports that accommodate ships in distress. The <span class="italic">Erika</span> need not have sunk if it could have entered the port, and it is therefore a reflection of the situation here. We need ports that can accommodate ships in distress, but if those ports are to allow ships to enter, we need compensation arrangements. Commissioner, I urge you to sort out those arrangements more quickly, because ports will then be far more willing to accommodate ships in distress and a case like that of the <span class="italic">Erika II</span> can be avoided.</p>

<p class="contents">The sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> reminded the world of the constant risk involved in the transport by sea of oil-based products, and made the need for a better understanding and monitoring of maritime traffic off the European coastline perfectly clear. The measures the Commission has proposed have gone much further and have not been restricted to proposals solely concerned with the oil sector, but have been extended to the maritime traffic sector as a whole. Today’s proposal, which relates to the directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, is a response to this concern. It sets up a global strategy with the intention of guaranteeing a high safety standard for this traffic along the whole of the European coastline, and its objective – I assure you – is prevention, through more precise identification and better monitoring of ships. It also has the objective of improving the response of the coastal authorities in the event of an accident or the risk of an accident, since, as Mr Hatzidakis mentioned, port control, the establishment of ports of refuge, and assistance to boats in difficulty are absolutely key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, throughout the whole of the analysis and discussion of this proposal, the Commission has enjoyed Parliament’s active support, as it has on all previous reports, particularly through Mr Sterckx’s most constructive contribution. I believe that cooperation between both institutions has paid off and today we are very close to reaching a definitive agreement on a text that, from the outset, involved sensitive issues, such as the prohibition of setting sail in bad weather, the aforementioned ports of refuge, for example, or the obligation to carry transponders or black boxes. In this regard, once again I would like to praise Mr Watts’ tenacity, thanks to which we have been able to secure Council’s agreement with regard to conciliation on the directive regarding the control of the port state.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to ports of refuge, I would like to say that compensation for possible damages are an absolutely fundamental feature, and here I agree with Mr Jarzembowski, if EU States are to make ports of refuge available, and this is an absolutely key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by thanking Mr Sterckx once again for his magnificent work, and also all of those responsible in the appropriate committee. We share many of your concerns and we accept all the amendments you have tabled. In this regard, I would highlight the follow-up of the report after three years and the true-to-life assessment of the situation, the issue of controls in places of refuge and assistance to boats. In short, we shall accept all the amendments that have been tabled and I hope they will also be accepted by the Council, which will mean that we do not have to resort to the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We will shortly be presenting the last measure needed to complete this package, a package that will allow us to significantly improve safety in sea transport. After Commission’s approval of the measures relating to the transport of passengers, we shall present the measures relating to crews, which is the human element and always a decisive factor.</p>
