<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Commissioner, the regional fisheries organisations are becoming increasingly important, particularly in fishing grounds with shared sovereignty or in the management of migratory or straddling stocks. As they are adapted to the specific characteristics of their areas, they are a particularly appropriate instrument for the rational management of resources. It is therefore a matter of priority that the European Union should equip itself with the machinery needed to ensure the full participation it deserves. The Commission’s communication confines itself to dealing with those aspects relating to the powers of the Community and Member States in tasks arising from their participation in those organisations. This approach is necessary but inadequate, since the European Union needs to adopt clear, uniform and homogeneous guidelines for its participation in the regional fisheries organisations. In view of the diverse nature of the existing regional organisations, the Community's participation in each of them must be suited to their individual characteristics. It must, however, obey the same basic principles from a legal and institutional point of view. Therefore the report by the parliamentary Committee on Fisheries advocates sharing tasks evenly between the Community and the Member States with regard to the regional fisheries organisations as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The leading role in the Community’s action should be played by the Commission, the guardian of Community interests, but it should not only deal with the representative role to which it seems hitherto to have confined itself through lack of resources. In future the Commission must not confine itself to being a mere figurehead: it must unequivocally and specifically take up all aspects of the Community's participation in these regional organisations, representing it, monitoring the transmission and verification of data, participating in scientific fora, and in general guiding Community action, including monitoring the fishing carried out in the context of these organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The monitoring of fisheries affects the jurisdiction of the Member States and hence to a certain extent the core of their sovereignty. This monitoring should be transferred to an unequivocally Community body, so that the common fisheries policy can apply to all Member States and to all vessels and crews regardless of their nationality, thus avoiding any possible breach of the principle of equal treatment. The administration of monitoring and, progressively, its actual execution must therefore be assigned to the Commission, and hence the cost of this must be borne by the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing machinery for transposing rules into Community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current sluggishness. But faster transposition into Community law of the rules adopted within the regional organisations does not exempt the Council and Parliament from doing their job of steering the Community fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the growing importance of the regional fisheries organisations (RFO), the European Union must fully exercise its powers in fisheries matters, but this raises a problem above all of human and material resources. Perhaps to side-step the problem of resources, the Commission has decided to propose a reformulation of the duties to be performed by the Community and the Member States, without modifying their respective competences. Although this approach might be acceptable as a temporary measure, it could cause serious regulatory and, above all, institutional problems if it were made permanent.</p>
<p class="contents">The distribution of tasks proposed by the Commission would assign ‘high-level’ representation to the Community and delegate representation on scientific and technical committees to the Member States. Contributing to the work of the RFOs would also be entrusted to the Member States, as would inspection and monitoring tasks. This means that the Community's role as a contracting party would be reduced to a mere façade.</p>
<p class="contents">European integration cannot be confined to declarations without any tangible content. While there is a common fisheries policy and the Community has powers in the sphere of fisheries it must equip itself with the human and material resources needed to tackle its obligations, as required by the principle of adequacy of resources inherent in the common fisheries policy. Similarly, if the Community is a contracting party in the RFOs, it must behave accordingly and perform the role required of it. The implementation of this principle has financial implications and requires legal changes and, possibly, sacrificing a certain amount of sovereignty; but if a particular model of political integration is chosen the means must be provided for that model to be put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has understood their importance perfectly and has drawn up an excellent report, which highlights the real weakness of the communication. Very good intentions which can only become reality if there is a genuine political desire.</p>
<p class="contents">When we think that, of all the coastal countries in the world, very few have the economic, judicial, legislative and political potential that the European Union has, that should tell us how much we should be asking ourselves what our responsibility is. Yet the Community neither gets involved nor takes a lead; the very most it does is react. But it reacts with such paltry means and so little foresight that in the end it is like sending David out against Goliath. Except that in the Bible David won, which is not the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been an observer in some regional organisations and I can assure you that it is pathetic to see two or three mid-ranking officials, exhausted and hardly getting any sleep, trying to react to problems that could be seen coming months earlier and facing high-powered delegations, which are high-powered either because they are from great powers like the United States or Japan or because they have followed an intelligent policy of forming alliances in advance. As the Directorate-General for Fisheries is currently being restructured and may gain more staff and better resources, I believe we should demand that priority be given to strengthening this area. It would mean, first of all, not having to confine itself to reacting to actions like that of the Galapagos Agreement and its manifest intention of unilaterally extending the jurisdictional waters of four countries in defiance of the basic norms of international maritime law, or against attempts to arbitrarily expel Community fleets, which are among the few that are governed by strict standards and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission has the obligation not only to properly represent us in the international maritime sphere but also to take the initiative. It should thus promote the setting-up of new regional organisations, beginning where the Community already has a presence, such as in the western Pacific and south Pacific. In view of the expected restructuring, I should like to ask specifically for a unit to be set up for large migratory species, the need for which has already been noted by the Commission insofar as it has drawn up a number of regulations just for these species, which are the main target for flags of convenience, a pirate scourge that inexplicably is spreading ever more widely.</p>

<p class="contents">The regional fisheries organisations and the Community's participation in them is an important issue. Covering nearly all the high seas these organisations provide an instrument to ensure active conservation and management of the fisheries resource. It is this precious resource that I should like to turn to.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a depletion of stocks already which puts fishing into a crisis situation. There is over-fishing, pollution of our seas, the climate is changing – we see that at the conference at the Hague at the moment – and the physical alteration of the environment puts increasing pressure on these finite resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the CFP will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important. In Scotland the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the World Wildlife Fund have got together to propose the concept of zonal regional management. The fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region. Although initially merely advisory in its recommendations, it is hoped that by illustrating efficiency and effectiveness over time it would earn a management role.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of a regionalisation of the CFP will be critical in ensuring local action. Regional fisheries organisations provided a role on an international scale and regional or zonal management can make the global become local. It will truly make for sustainable fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because Europe’s Member States are obsessed with disputes in Community waters, they forget, in practical terms, that fishing has a worldwide dimension, in terms of both the conservation of marine stocks and production and also the markets and the nature of the fleets. As a result, some countries in the Union, such as Galicia, which I represent, are affected particularly badly by this situation and by the consequent lack of human and material resources afflicting the European Commission in its implementation of the common policy for regional fishing organisations.</p>

As we have just heard, part of the problem is extensive environmental pollution, such as the recent tanker accidents and, let us face it, there is no shortage of tanker accidents nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main reason is overexploitation of fish stocks due to the huge catching capacity of the fishing fleets. For the sake of the environment, and fishermen, we must aim to achieve sustainable management of fish resources. However, if we are to achieve this objective, the Community still has a few important steps to take. And time is running out.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication to the Council and Parliament, the Commission criticises the lack of uniform regulations governing fisheries within and beyond exclusive economic zones. The law of the survival of the fittest still applies on the high seas. This law is based on the overriding principle of the freedom of the high seas. The sea knows no borders. There is hardly a fish in it which is permanently domiciled. I am referring here to all migratory fish stocks. Any over-fishing has a domino effect, and careful handling of fish resources is a pointless exercise if everyone else is ruthlessly pursuing their own economic interests and paying no heed whatsoever to the need to protect stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has the fourth largest fishing capacity in the world. However, its importance does not give it the right to take measures at its own convenience and any measures taken must be in keeping with its international obligations. It is because of this global perspective that international collaboration is needed and, to be sure, the most important committees – and this brings us back to the basis for collaboration – are made up mainly of regional fisheries organisations. It is not just since the 1995 New York Agreement that their importance has been recognised; basically they are the best way of fostering responsible fishing. They alone are able to implement supra-regional regulations in keeping with local conditions. They carry out statistical programmes and are responsible for inspections and the monitoring system. They are the most efficient way of ensuring that rules are not ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of regional fisheries organisations to sustainable fishing, it is imperative that the EU be granted a seat in every regional fisheries organisation. That way we can be sure that we will all end up pulling in the same direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are backing the regional fisheries organisations; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the Commission to have more weight in them. When we say more organisations, we mean those that can and should be set up in the South Atlantic or South Pacific – as has already been said here – and for the Commission to take a leading role in them. I believe the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations, and the Commission must make every possible effort, Commissioner, to this end. To support the United Nations position in both the 1982 Convention and the New York one, which has been mentioned here, we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing. You can count on the support of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries, including our support for acquiring more material and human resources, which, as has been shown, are much needed. We are a budgetary authority and I believe we should fund this line, because in these organisations and in these waters we are staking a lot on the future of fisheries in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, therefore, to stress that the opinion of Parliament is practically unanimous, and so the Commission should realise that we are allies in this constructive endeavour to give the Commission greater weight – more staff, as we have said. In comparison with other nations the European Union representation is clearly small, so we have to have more and better representation, Mr Fischler. Let me say that we are going to continue this strategy of calling you before our committee in advance to inform us of the positions that you intend to advocate. We shall do so together with the fishing sector so that we can form a common, joint opinion Then you will have to return to the parliamentary committee for the Commission to report back to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close, Mr President, by once again congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Jové, for the magnificent report he has drawn up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Throughout the European Union and far beyond we are all well aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been the source of tremendous disagreement between the fishermen, on one hand, and the scientists, on the other. To some extent, those of us who are politicians find ourselves in the middle. We are neither fishermen nor scientists and we try to find the way and the truth between what both are saying to us. This is an extremely difficult position to have to try to find a way through.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would say to this House and to the Commissioner is that we need information of the highest quality and the highest standard that we can all, scientists, fishermen or politicians, take on board. That is why I believe there is a tremendous role for the Commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should take account of the views of the national regional authorities and the industry. The Commissioner, when he replied to my report last month, seemed to get his geographical situations slightly mixed up – he did not know whether he was going to Scotland, Ireland or Northern Ireland. I suddenly discovered that he went to Scotland and the Republic of Ireland but he did not come to Northern Ireland. Hopefully, geographically, he will be much better placed in the future. I know he knows where Northern Ireland is and I certainly hope he will come in the future to visit the fishermen there.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say, before we come to a decision that will end the chaos – because I think we are all aware of the situation we are facing coming into December on TACs and quotas – that it is going to be extremely difficult not only for the regional and national areas and the fishermen but also for the Commission. We need a better way of addressing this at a better time of the year with a greater lead in and greater cooperation than we have had in the past. I ask the Commission to take that on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with all of you who have said that we need more regional fisheries organisations and I agree with Mr Varela and other speakers that the Commission has a role to play in these regional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the House that the question of controls must be a cornerstone in the area of regional fisheries policy. However, I must again stress the Commission's position that it cannot accept sole responsibility for controls in regional fisheries organisations. It is in fact the Member States – in keeping with the basic structure of the European Union – which are primarily responsible for controls. In exercising their sovereign rights as flag states, they must provide the necessary human, financial and material resources needed in order for the Community to meet its international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore stands by its conclusion in the communication that, as far as controls are concerned, NAFO is an exceptional case and should not become the rule. The Commission should concentrate on its own job, which is to monitor and coordinate the implementation of controls in the regional fisheries organisations by the Member States. The Commission is also required to carry out a huge amount of work in connection with negotiations held within the framework of regional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It would quite simply be inappropriate to disregard current institutional practice in the Community in relation to responsibility for controlling ships operating on the high seas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate two fundamental points here. First, the Community must be consistent in its actions, irrespective of whether we are talking about controls in Community waters or controls on the high seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the stand which we take on this subject must be in keeping with the stand taken during the current debate on the Commission's so-called core activities, which is why the discussion of control measures goes beyond regional fisheries organisations. We need to select a comprehensive <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>which takes account of all fisheries activities in the Community, both in EU waters and on the high seas.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to consider a completely new take on the Commission's remit in relation to controls inside and outside Community waters, then I think that it we should do so in connection with preparations to reform the common fisheries policy. That means that we shall have plenty of opportunity here next year to discuss these issues in depth. So much for the central tenet of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few brief comments now on a number of other points. As far as the time taken to implement the decisions of the regional fisheries organisations is concerned, I agree that the Commission's record can and must be improved. Some progress has already been made but our efforts must focus on better planning.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of infringements and sanctions: the Commission has always been in favour of including sanctions in the control regulations. Without sanctions, we have no teeth. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded so far in getting our ideas across because the Council has always resisted them. But we shall try, as part of the ongoing work to create an area of freedom, security and justice, as formulated and decided at the Tampere Summit, to make progress on this question also.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the reproach under point 16, where it says that the Commission wants to exclude Parliament from the process of Community participation in the various regional fisheries organisations. That is quite untrue; in fact the opposite is true. The Commission has always spoken out here in favour of the rules for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission and has always adhered to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
