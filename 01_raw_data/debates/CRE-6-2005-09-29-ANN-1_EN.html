<p>Recent research by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions indicated that just 23% of temporary agency workers receive paid 'on-the-job' training or are sent on training and courses by their employer, as against 35% of permanent employees. The research concluded that, since new skills and occupational competencies are the key to employability, it is more difficult for employees with non-permanent work contracts to make the transition to the regular jobs market or to have access to new jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>Given these findings, is the Council Presidency making any efforts to achieve progress on the Draft Directive on Temporary Agency Workers, which has been blocked in Council for over two years and which would seek to give temporary agency workers the same opportunities and benefits as their colleagues who have permanent jobs?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) I would like to thank the Honourable Member for his continuing interest in this complex and politically sensitive matter.</p>
<p>The main difficulty, as you know, is finding a solution which reflects the concerns of Member States and labour market diversity across the EU. A solution is needed which finds the right balance between giving temporary agency workers adequate protection and allowing the agency market to develop and grow so that it can contribute to meeting the Lisbon goals of increasing employment and providing better jobs. Member States have recently renewed their commitment to achieving these goals, I believe they can, be achieved in ways which respect the different practices and traditions in the national labour markets.</p>
<p>As you are probably aware, the Netherlands Presidency in the latter half of last year held discussions at various levels to ascertain whether positions remained the same on the Directive since the last substantive debate in June 2003. In the last few weeks, the UK Presidency has been in contact with the Member States. Unfortunately, the UK Presidency, in common with previous Presidencies, found that very little had changed and that views remain very polarised. At this stage therefore, the UK Presidency does not envisage putting this item on the agenda of the Council in December, although it is keeping the issue under review.</p>
<p>I would like to stress that the UK Presidency wants to work constructively to find a solution which is acceptable to all Member States. However, it is clear from our bilateral contacts that many Member States still have problems with the current text.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0678"></a>

<p>(EL) Τhe Council is aware of the events referred to by the honourable Member. Freedom of expression in Turkey is a sector in which, despite the improvements achieved, there are still numerous problems. The need for more constant efforts to be made, especially on the general framework for the exercise of fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, has already been emphasised repeatedly by the European Council.</p>
<p>In its position for the meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council on 26 April 2005, the European Union stated that, although there had been cases in which superior courts had acquitted persons who had been prosecuted for non-violent expression of opinion, in various other cases journalists, publishers, writers and other citizens were still being prosecuted. The Council further noted that the new penal code only achieves limited progress in this sector and expressed its satisfaction with Turkey's declared intention of introducing amendments with a view to improving the relevant provisions relating to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.</p>
<p>The new penal code issued on 1 June could be considered a positive step. The new penal code is, as a whole, an important step forward and introduces numerous positive amendments in sectors such as gender equality and respect for women's rights and the combating of torture chambers and maltreatment. Nonetheless, the postponement of the entry into force of the penal code was not used to make important amendments to the text; certain provisions of the code relating to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press are still formulated in somewhat unclear terms and could be interpreted in a restrictive manner by judges or public prosecutors. That is why the European Union will monitor the application of the penal code closely, especially the provisions of the code relating to the media and freedom of expression, in order to evaluate its efficacy in practice.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, and in full keeping with the conclusions of the European Council in December 2004, the Commission will continue to monitor closely the actual and overall application of the political reform process in Turkey and will submit regular reports to the Council. It goes without saying that this includes the question of freedom of expression. Consequently, the Council can assure the honourable Member that it will monitor this question closely and will raise it at all the appropriate levels, especially within the framework of the continuing political dialogue with Turkey and within the framework of the various bodies set up on the basis of the EC-Turkey association agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0685"></a>

In order to promote this, the Council in May 2005 transferred EUR 2 million from the TACIS programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).

<p>(EL) Naturally the Council also is still very worried about avian influenza.The Member States are responsible for the measures which are taken at national level to control diseases which occur, such as influenza pandemics. The Commission is informed of progress with their programmes and it is the Commission that coordinates action at Community level.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen coordination between veterinary measures and measures to protect public health, a meeting was held between the heads of the medical services and the heads of the veterinary services on 22 September 2005, at which the need was emphasised for the ΕU to continue to work in close liaison and to coordinate closely with the competent international bodies.</p>
<p>As regards the financing measures, the Council is examining, within the framework of the future financial debate, a Commission proposal for a new regulation on the EU Solidarity Fund. The proposal includes the facility to contribute to the cost in the event of a pandemic, including the cost of vaccines and antivirals.</p>
<p>Networks of veterinary laboratories and human health laboratories have been created in the ΕU with the objective of combating the threat of influenza viruses. As the honourable Member perhaps knows, the ΕU has a surveillance network which was set up with Community cofinancing and is known as the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme. The Early Warning and Response System links the competent authorities in the Member States, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Commission in the event of danger from this sort of disease.</p>
<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will offer advice and support on public health issues in order to guarantee the compatibility and standardisation of surveillance and protection measures throughout the ΕU.</p>
<p>The next ΕU/WHO conference will be held on 24 to 26 October 2005 in order to review progress in preparations by the Member States since the last conference in March 2005 as regards the possible influenza pandemic. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will take the opportunity to establish how the Member States intend to decide which social groups are most vulnerable and, by extension, what the order of priority will be for inoculations and antivirals.</p>
<p>In addition, a pandemic influenza exercise (Exercise Common Ground) has been scheduled for 23 and 24 November 2005, in order to test the communications systems and the preparedness of the Member States to deal with a possible influenza pandemic.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0688"></a>

<p>Since the mid-1980s, the EU has had a fisheries agreement with Morocco, including Western Sahara which has one of the world's richest fishing grounds. The United Nations, among others, defines Western Sahara as the last colony in Africa. The exploitation of Western Sahara's natural resources by Moroccan and other foreign companies can, therefore, be seen as illegal.</p>
<p>On 28 July 2005, the EU signed a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, which will also cover the territory of Western Sahara. This differs, for example, from the USA, which has excluded from its free trade agreement with Morocco all products originating from Western Sahara.</p>
<p>In the light of this situation, and if the Council shares the view that Western Sahara is the last colony in Africa, is it justifiable to include Western Sahara in the agreement with Morocco?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The EU condemns all acts of violence in Kashmir, and urges the militants to recognise that their actions cannot bring about a resolution to the Kashmir issue. Rather, a durable settlement can only be achieved through dialogue between India and Pakistan, taking into account the wishes of all the peoples of Kashmir.</p>

<p>On 6 July 2005, Parliament voted for an amendment to the ERDF regulation (Article 7(d) – <a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2005-0279_EN.html">P6_TA(2005)0279</a>) in which it hoped that expenditure which relates to renovation of social housing with a view to saving energy and protecting the environment in the context of sustainable urban development would become eligible. It appears that in the Council of Ministers several states expressed strong reservations and indeed some opposition to this eligibility. As a former Minister of Housing, I can assure you that salubrious housing acts as an important social lever and this brings housing into the field of social, economic and territorial cohesion, which is the regional policy’s prime objective. I can also say that methods of financing currently available nationally are insufficient to tackle the numerous housing problems.

Agents for the firm have told would-be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot. The agents say some of the company's products have been exported to the UK (and most likely to other EU states), and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is 'traditional' and nothing to 'make such a big fuss about'. Doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing numbers seeking to improve their looks.

<p>(EL) The states that have nuclear weapons provide security assurances, which have been updated within the framework of UN Security Council resolution 984/1995, on the basis of which the states in question undertake, under certain clearly defined circumstances, not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states that are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The ΕU welcomed this resolution and supported, within the framework of common position 2005/329/PESC adopted before the 2005 NPT review conference, the call on the states with nuclear weapons to reaffirm the security assurances in question and to pursue consideration of this issue.</p>
<p>Similarly, as regards in particular the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons, I would recall that the European Security Strategy (ESS) approved by the European Council in December 2003 confirmed that the fundamental framework for international relations is the UN Charter and that the UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
<p>Article 51 of the UN Charter recognises the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’; however, this right applies ‘if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations’. It further states that the exercise of this right ‘shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council’.</p>
<p>In addition, in the ESS, ‘an effective multilateral system’ is recognised as the cornerstone of the EU's foreign policy and the prevention of conflict is recognised as a priority through the ‘development of a stronger international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based international order’.</p>
<p>Consequently, the EU Security Strategy defines the objective of ‘preventive engagement’, which may include but is not confined to pre-emptive measures. ‘We need to be able to act before countries around us deteriorate, when signs of proliferation are detected, and before humanitarian emergencies arise’. The extent to which preventive engagement includes the use of military force must be decided on a case-by-case basis, within the framework of the UN Charter and international law. The Council does not support any pre-emptive action taken outside the UN Charter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0728"></a>

<p>(EN) It is not possible to answer the Honourable Member's first question on the amount of organised crime in general terms. Whilst some forms of organised crime may be increasing, others may be decreasing. In this respect, the Council refers to the 2005 EU Organised Crime Report, drafted by Europol, the public version of which will be forwarded to Parliament.</p>
<p>As far as the various types of organised crime are concerned, this report shows that drugs trafficking remains the most common type of crime among organised crime groups that target the EU. Whereas trafficking in some types of drugs may have stabilised or even decreased, trafficking in other types of drugs has gone up.</p>
<p>As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned, the report states that while there has been no real change in volume, there is a consolidation of the organised crime involvement.</p>
<p>As regards fraud, the report highlights that this is an extremely lucrative and often underestimated OC activity. Fraud is the perfect example of low-risk, high-profit crime and second only to drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Regarding trafficking in stolen vehicles, it appears that the number of stolen cars in the EU is slightly decreasing, but that the number of missing stolen vehicles has remained relatively stable. Consequently, the number of missing vehicles as a percentage of the total has increased in several Member States.</p>
<p>Other forms of trafficking, such as tobacco smuggling, illicit firearms trafficking and illegal waste trafficking, also remain important.</p>
<p>The EU Organised Crime Threat Assessment which Europol will be producing from 2006 onwards and which will replace the Organised Crime Situation Reports will allow Member States to have a clearer sense of the scale and nature of the current threat of organised crime to the EU, and assist the Member States in developing a strategy for combating it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0750"></a>

The Commission has published a Communication specifically on language learning and linguistic diversity Communication<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Language learning and training can generally be co-financed by the European Social Fund.</p>
<p>DISCAPNET, the European disability portal, is a successful Spanish project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Although the translation of software on its own is not financed by the ERDF, there are several other ERDF co-financed projects in related areas. In the framework of INTERREG, the Community Initiative which focuses on cross border cooperation, Directorate General Regional Policy (REGIO) can finance the translation costs of documents if they represent an indispensable part of the project.</p>
<p>Although language difficulties may occur in the context of the use of information technology, new technologies are also able to provide quite effective translations of text and speech.

<p>The projects financed from the Cohesion Fund must cost more than EUR 10 million. Small countries find it difficult to get such projects off the ground. The preparation and implementation of such large-scale projects require cooperation between the administrations of several countries, and that complicates project management and the use of the financial resources allocated. And that also infringes the 'N+2 rule' again.</p>

<p>The Cohesion Fund will be covered by the new general regulation from 2007 and two important changes will be introduced: The Cohesion Fund will be managed through programmes rather than on a project by project basis; and the automatic decommitment rule will apply to Cohesion Fund programmes as to all others. The Commission is aware of the difficulties faced by some Member States and regions in the conception and design of large projects, in the timely presentation of applications for cofinance and in the implementation of projects once decisions are taken. The answer to these difficulties does not lie in changing the automatic decommitment rule but in equipping Member States and regions to advance projects more rapidly. In this way the benefits of projects are delivered more speedily to Community citizens.

<p>(EN) The rules on infringement proceedings are laid down in Article 226 (ex Article 169) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice has held<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that the purpose of such proceedings is to put right an ongoing infringement and to prevail over the inertia and resistance of Member States.

<p>The Commission may not bring proceedings before the Court for Treaty infringement unless a Member State has failed to comply with the reasoned opinion within the time-limit set<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing at the end of that time-limit<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Where a reasoned opinion has been issued and the Court has found that the alleged infringement had ceased to exist before the imposed deadline, the Commission’s action has been rejected by the Court as inadmissible’<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the Lloyd’s case the Commission issued two letters of formal notice but did not issue a reasoned opinion. In the case of Equitable Life, the Commission has declared itself satisfied with the United Kingdom’s implementation of the relevant Directive and any problems appear to be problems of practical application rather than of transposition. In both cases it is quite clear that the United Kingdom non-life and life insurance regulatory and supervisory regimes that had been called into question by various correspondents, complainants and petitioners have been radically amended since the occurrence of the problems brought to the Commission’s and Parliament’s attention.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that there is a “large loophole” in infringement proceedings. Nor does the Commission see what would be the purpose of bringing proceedings to establish that an infringement might have existed in the past. The Commission must respect the rules of the Treaty and the jurisprudence of the Court. Since the rules on infringement proceedings are laid down in the Treaty, any modification of those rules would require a formal Treaty amendment.</p>
<p>The main point at issue here appears to be the payment of compensation. The Commission has consistently stated that action to seek compensation has to be pursued before the national authorities and courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member’s question raises some important issues, namely:</p>
<p>The use and availability of recent data;</p>
<p>The timeliness of decision making in the area of financial services, and ;</p>
<p>The need to bring the analysis in line with developments in the financial markets.</p>
<p>On the use and availability of recent data, the Commission would like to point out that the analysis carried out by it in the context of the Financial Integration Monitor is a continuous exercise. The Commission takes into account the most recent (and reliable) data available at the time of the analysis. But here, the Commission is very much dependent on the speed and periodicity of those who gather and publish data at Member State-, EU- as well as at the international level. It therefore encourages and supports efforts at all levels to improve the speed of data provision as this would allow it to be even more up-to-date in its analysis in the future.</p>
<p>On the timeliness of the decision making, the Commission has deployed every possible instrument to ensure a more timely delivery of important legislation in the area of financial services. And, the decision time for new financial services legislation has effectively been shortened considerably in recent years.</p>
<p>On aligning analysis with market developments: the Commission not only looks into trends and developments, as demonstrated in the Financial Integration Monitor, but also carries out impact assessments and consults extensively with stakeholders. This should ensure that new developments in financial markets are not overlooked and that our regulatory responses to market developments and needs are timely and proportionate.</p>
<p>In the context of aligning policy with market developments, it is however important to keep in mind that the EU Financial Services Policy is based on a longer term strategy (Financial Services Action Plan 1999-2004, Upcoming White Paper 2005-2010), directed at creating an efficiently operating Internal Market for Financial Services for all EU Member States. The analysis in the Financial Integration Monitor is carried out in this longer term perspective, analysing trends in structure, competition, efficiency and stability of the EU financial sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0733"></a>

<p>(EN) Public authorities decide themselves how to manage and organise public services. When they contract out services, the Commission applies public procurement law in compliance with the rules set out in the European procurement Directives and with the case law of the Court of Justice. There has been no change to this practice in the past years.</p>
<p>Generally, when a public authority decides to conclude a contract against remuneration with a third party that is legally distinct from itself, internal market rules and in particular public procurement rules apply. This is also valid for the relationship between public authorities.</p>
<p>The aim of the public procurement rules is to guarantee the efficiency of public spending, to the benefit of both consumers and taxpayers. When a service is asked against remuneration the best solution from the economic point of view should be achieved, no matter whether the service provider is public or private.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Commission is not disputing that inter-communal co-operation is also possible outside the field of application of the internal market provisions. For example, instead of concluding individual service contracts, public authorities may completely transfer their competence for a given service to another public entity, with the result that this entity will then provide the service. In such a case, public procurement law does not apply as no public contract against remuneration is concluded between the two authorities concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0755"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the recent ruling of the Court that fully confirms the position of the Commission. The Court decision outlines that the competences of the European Community to protect the environment also include the power to require Member States to ensure such protection through criminal sanctions for serious offences.</p>
<p>The Commission still needs to study carefully the implications of the decision for pending or imminent legislative procedures. Nevertheless, at this stage, the Commission believes it can already draw some interesting conclusions from it.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Court clearly underlines, in accordance with the Commission position, that criminal law has not suddenly become a new policy area for the EC.</p>
<p>Secondly, what the Court tells us is that the European Community can ask Member States to use all means, including their national criminal law, to ensure the proper enforcement of EC rules. This ruling deals primarily with EC environmental law. The Commission believes however that it is applicable in substance to all areas of competence of the EC, including the Internal Market – one of the main EC policies.</p>
<p>In conformity with the Court ruling, the EC law can impose criminal offences for serious offences, where they are the only proportionate and dissuasive measures to ensure that an EC policy is implemented.</p>
<p>This means that the inclusion of provisions on criminal law in EC legislation will only be possible in a limited number of cases.

<p>The Commission can only agree with the Honourable Member that it should limit the uncertainty for growers by arriving at a final Decision on the Reform proposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Beet growers will continue to receive the decoupled payment for sugar beet even after they abandoned beet growing. In addition to that, the Commission proposal foresees that beet growers shall be entitled to an additional payment in the case that they cease the delivery of sugar beet to a factory that abandons sugar production for the marketing year 2006/2007.</p>
<p>Beet growers have had to live with a certain amount of uncertainty already under the current Common Market Organisation where production levies, declassification, the selling price for B-beet and production quotas for the current marketing year have always been known only in October - that is after sowing had already taken place in some Member States.</p>
<p>For the marketing year 2006/07 the Regulation (EC) N° 1260/2001 states that, as from 2006, there will be no quota and no institutional prices.

<p>(EN) It is true that a significant number of developing countries – and notably the Last Developed Countries, benefit from reduced or even zero duties for their imports into the EU. However, what is at stake in the Doha Development Agenda are the Most Favoured Nation duties, applicable to all World Trade Organisation (WTO) members. Here, we have some margins of reduction and we are discussing the tariff reduction formula. (At this stage of the negotiations we would think in terms of limited variations around the pivotal number defining the cut within the bands). In view of the confidentiality of the negotiations it would seem to be impossible to openly quantify the negotiating margins.</p>
<p>On domestic support it is very important that all developed Members and not only the EU, contribute to the process of agricultural reform, by undertaking meaningful commitments in all forms of trade-distorting domestic support. On trade distorting domestic support we have already said we will undertake the biggest cuts. Thanks to our Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reforms we are in a strong position to do so. And we are continuing the reform process through our recent sugar proposals.</p>

<p>(EN) The President of the Commission during his presentation in the Temporary Committee on financial Perspectives in April expressed his opinion on co-financing, and the Commission gave further elaboration in its answer to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0293_EN.html">H-0293/05</a> from the Mr Seppänen<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In these answers the Commission has underlined that in theory the concept of co-financing of the Common Agricultural Policy could contribute to some extent to the resolution of the problem of excessive negative budget positions. However, there are other aspects that have to be taken into account. Overall, the Commission does not believe such a solution would facilitate the conclusions of the current negotiations.</p>
<p>Therefore, while national co-financing is a fundamental element in funding agriculture under the second pillar that is rural development, the Commission’s position on the funding of the first pillar direct aid and market measures is for total funding from the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposal for the Financial Perspectives 2007 – 2013 has been based on this position, for several reasons. Firstly, it would call into question the financial solidarity for the agricultural sector in Europe, which produces, processes and trades its goods on the single market. In other words it would distant competition if it was not compulsory. Secondly, introducing compulsory co-financing of a common policy would lead to the Union imposing expenditure on Member States. Furthermore non-compulsory co-financing is the first step towards renationalisation. The Commission is against renationalisation. Thirdly, Compulsory national co-financing will not reduce total public expenditure but only replace EU by national budgets. Forthly the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)-reform 2003 as well as the integration of the new Member States into the CAP, were both decided under the assumption of 100 % Community financing.</p>
<p>Introducing co-financing at this stage would call into question these decisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is deeply convinced that India and Bangladesh have both a lot to gain from enhanced bilateral relations and this is the message it has been consistently conveying to India and Bangladesh in its dialogue with them. The recent visit of the Indian External Affairs Minister Mr. Natwar Singh to Dhaka shows the genuine interest on both sides to solve the complex issues overshadowing the countries’ relations, including the river and water management issue.</p>
<p>Water management is indeed a key issue in South Asia, and the Commission is due to start support to a water programme in India in the context of the State Partnership Programme. The Commission stands ready to help at a cross border level and plans to convene with other donors in autumn to discuss a way forward on water issues in the region.</p>
<p>The long standing and keen support the Commission has given to the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which in the Commission’s view is the prime instrument to address collective challenges and to accelerate the region’s development should be emphasised. The Commission has set up the ‘EC-SAARC programme’ in an effort to encourage regional co-operation and is optimistic that the next SAARC Summit on 12/13 November in Dhaka will allow India, Bangladesh and the other members to make substantial progress on issues of common concern.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0672"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council’s framework decision of 13 June 2002 lays down a definition of ‘terrorist act’ which has had to be incorporated into the legislation of all the Member States, including provisions dealing with terrorist groups. In addition, penalties consistent with the seriousness of the acts concerned are to be imposed on the natural and legal persons who have committed or are responsible for them. Judicial rules are to be laid down with a view to ensuring that terrorist acts can be prosecuted effectively. Each Member State is required to take the measures needed to ensure that the terrorist acts referred to in the framework decision are defined as criminal offences under their national law.</p>
<p>Member States cannot deny entry to their territory to their own citizens. However, in the context of the measures to combat international terrorism it is for the competent authorities in the Member States to decide whether details of individuals wanted for arrest should be entered in the Schengen Information System (the relevant details can also be forwarded to Interpol), pursuant to Article 95 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985. In June 2000 Ireland asked to take part in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, covering police and judicial cooperation in criminal law matters, the fight against drugs and the Schengen Information System (SIS). The Council approved that request by means of a decision of 28 February 2002<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regards Europol, its powers are restricted to the exchange and processing of information relating to international organised crime, including terrorism.

<p>(EN) The Commission understands that the Honourable Member is interested in the transposition of the Tobacco Advertising Directive (2003/33/EC) even though at the same time he makes reference to Directive 2001/37/EC which is the Tobacco Products Directive. The latter has been transposed in all the Member States. One Member State is in the stage of finalising the official communication of its transposition measures to the Commission.</p>
<p>As regards the Tobacco Advertising Directive, the deadline for transposition expired on 31 July 2005. So far, fourteen Member States have notified the Commission of their transposition.</p>
<p>At this stage the Commission is not aware of the reasons for not notifying the transposition of the Directive into national law in Ireland. However, according to information available to the Commission, Ireland does have in place a comprehensive ban on all forms of tobacco sponsorship and advertising. The ban goes beyond the minimum requirements set by the Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that Article 226 of the EC Treaty empowers it to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States for not transposing or not implementing EU laws. The Commission will not hesitate to use these powers in order to ensure full, effective and timely implementation of Community law.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the Commission intends to send a “letter of formal notice” to the Member States which have failed to communicate their transposition of the Directive. This is a serious reminder to the Member States about their obligations to implement strong policies against tobacco. In this letter, the Commission will invite Member States to submit their observations within two months of receipt. The Commission will thus be able to provide the Honourable Member with a fuller picture on the transposition of the Directive towards the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In response to the Flash Airlines accident in January 2004, and in order to provide the public with greater transparency, the Commission, last February, adopted a proposal for a regulation making it mandatory for passengers to be provided with information on the identity of the carrier<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This proposal also provided for the publication of a blacklist of companies subject to an operating ban or to traffic rights restrictions, on safety grounds, in one or more Member States.</p>
<p>As the proposal currently stands, the publication of such a Community blacklist does not, however, imply that all of the companies on the list are banned throughout the Community.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on examination of this proposal – which must be adopted at the earliest opportunity – the Commission supports Parliament’s amendments aimed at speeding up the process of publishing a Community blacklist, at making the list more workable and at ensuring that any company on the list is banned from flying anywhere in EU territory.

<p>(EN) On 8 July 2005 the EU Council of Ministers adopted Directives for the negotiation of a Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco. Following negotiations, which were based on these directives and took into account scientific advice with respect to the sustainability of fisheries in the waters concerned, the Commission and the Moroccan authorities initialled a draft agreement on 28 July 2005 establishing framework for joint cooperation in fisheries. The agreed text will soon be submitted to the Council for formal approval.</p>
<p>The content and legal wording of the initialled draft agreement follows established United Nations best practice and does not, in any way, prejudice the status of Western Sahara according to international law. The agreement sets fishing possibilities for a limited number of Community vessels in the fishing zone under Moroccan control or, as defined in Art. 2 of the agreement, “in the waters over which the Kingdom of Morocco has sovereignty or jurisdiction”. As in the case of the previous agreement between the European Community and Morocco, the draft agreement contains no references to the Western Sahara.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement it is up to the Moroccan authorities to define the fishing zones on the basis of which fishing licences will be issued, as well as to ensure the full application of the Fisheries Agreement in accordance with the requirements and obligations under international law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0697"></a>

<p>(EN) The Mavrommatis Report <a href="/doceo/document/A-6-2005-0185_EN.html">A6-0185/2005</a> is a comprehensive report, and sets out the extensive background of the International and EU policy frameworks in the area of child labour. It specifically calls on the Commission to address children’s rights in its revision of the Development policy statement and in its country and regional programmes, with an emphasis on birth registration, the strategic partnership with International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the field of development cooperation and the links with the right to education.</p>
<p>A full response by the Commission to the Mavrommatis Report will be issued shortly.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight at this stage that is committed to the objective of eradicating child labour. The Commission supports the effective application of core labour standards. Eradication of child labour constitute an important element of this. Recently, the Commission indicated that it will strengthen the external dimension of EU employment and social policies. In this context the Commission is committed to intensify its support for the promotion of decent work for all as defined by the ILO and the February 2004 final report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Eradication of child labour is part of decent work agenda covering in a coherent way rights at work, employment, social protection and social dialogue. The Commission has also intensified its cooperation with the ILO. The promotion of core labour standards and of decent work for all is part of the overall cooperation framework between the Commission and ILO renewed by the 14<span class="sup">th</span> May 2001 Exchange of letters. The July 2004 strategic partnership with the ILO is part of this overall cooperation. The Commission has already taken - in recent years - a number of concrete initiatives at central and de-central level in relation to the eradication of child labour, the promotion of the related core labour standards and the promotion of decent work in different policy areas. However, the Commission will intensify the concrete actions and initiatives.</p>
<p>In its trade policy, the EU promotes the effective application of core labour standards, including the fight against child labour, through positive instruments and an incentive-based approach. In its bilateral trade relations, the EU uses instruments such as the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the Cotonou Agreement for this purpose.</p>
<p>Concerning trade related interventions, the Commission will investigate the legal and practical aspects of labelling schemes, including the feasibility of such schemes with respect to World Trade Organisation (WTO) international trade rules. Furthermore, the Commission will continue to pursue the promotion of core labour standards and decent work in bilateral agreements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Generally speaking, the Commission considers that tax reductions are not an appropriate response to the increase in prices for oil products. It could also lead to distortions of competition between Member States and undermine the EU's environment policy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Commission understands the difficulties that Member States and citizens are confronted with. While the Commission has not taken a formal position on this, it would seem that a use of some of the increased tax revenue linked to price increases to specifically help the most vulnerable citizens could be a possible solution. This, of course, would have to be decided by Member States in the light of their own national circumstances. In addition, Member States can use increased tax revenues as a means to provide additional incentives for energy savings by energy consumers, which would result in net economic benefits for energy users as well as contribute to develop structural and sustainable solutions to the economic vulnerability to high energy prices.</p>

As part of that consideration, the Commission decided to propose the extension of the option of applying reduced rates to the categories for which a significant number of Member States were already authorised to apply reduced rates under specific derogations and where, therefore, a common need had already been established. This is not the case of fuel for heating, which is subject to the standard rate in most of the Member States.</p>
<p>After several meetings at ministerial level on this proposal, no agreement has yet been reached in the Council.</p>
<p>Concerning the possibility for Member States to introduce adaptation mechanisms in order to stabilise their VAT receipts in cases of significant increase of price of oil products, the Honourable Member will understand that the Commission cannot take a position without having examined in detail the concrete measures introduced by some Member States in order to face the problems created by this situation. As a general assessment, it can be said that the 6<span class="sup">th</span> VAT Directive does not prevent Member States to use additional tax receipts that have been collected due to the high oil prices to finance social policy measures designed to specifically help the most vulnerable citizens to face the consequences of such price levels; this may include schemes to help them acquiring heating oil or other basics. It is clear that such measures have to be taken outside the common VAT system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The EU believes that good social and environmental conditions underpin sustainable development and promote the socially efficient production of goods and services. Investment in people, providing real opportunities for all, policies that mitigate the adverse effects of a changing economy on specific groups of people or regions, good social services accessible to all, social dialogue, the respect for fundamental social rights including core labour standards, minimum standards for working conditions and for ensuring workers’ upstream involvement in managing change, all play a crucial role in development.</p>
<p>In the World Trade Organisation (WTO) context, the issue was included in the Declaration of the 1<span class="sup">st</span> WTO Ministerial Conference (Singapore 1996) with a reference to core labour standards. WTO members have not agreed to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and International Labour Organisation (ILO), both in the EU Trade Policy Review (TPR) and in the TPRs of other countries. As part of this process, International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each Trade Policy Review.</p>
<p>The EC remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of environmental and social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes, and it rejects any unilateral sanctions-based approach. The objective is to further enhance environmental and social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all. The EC therefore welcomed the creation of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation under the aegis of the ILO, as well as the reinforcement of the ILO in order to promote social development, and the adoption of higher labour standards worldwide. In order to contribute to an effective follow-up of the report, the Commission adopted on 18 May 2004 a Communication on the Social Dimension of Globalisation<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently developing a closer relationship with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on trade-related matters. The EC-ILO Turin Conference in May 2005 examined options for strengthening the EC-ILO partnership including on the assessment of social and labour impacts of trade policy, and on promoting core labour standards through capacity building and enforcement in developing countries. Also in 2005, an EC-ILO pilot project will develop methodologies for decent work indicators in developing countries.</p>
<p>The EC has also pursued social development objectives in regional, bi-regional and bilateral arrangements. All of its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights. The EC has for example entered into dialogue and co-operation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and bi-regionally with the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries as well as a number of other regions. Since 1998, the EC has also been granting further trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO or comply with internationally recognised standards on sustainable forest management. In the framework of the new GSP scheme adopted on 27 June 2005 by the Council, a new GSP incentive for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries which have signed and effectively implemented the core United Nations (UN)/ILO human/labour right international conventions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Union's priorities are clearly set out and it is these priorities which determine the 2006 budget. Pursuing the enlargement process and implementing the Lisbon strategy require investment in cohesion and competitiveness, particularly as regards scientific research, education, training, and enhanced mobility for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Regional policy has a key role to play in achieving these objectives, since it is precisely at regional level that actions to promote education, employment and gender equality can be most effectively put into practice.</p>
<p>How will the Commission effectively implement the cohesion policy, including measures to combat unemployment and labour market discrimination and improve mobility, when the Council is proposing in its draft budget for 2006 to cut the total allocation for structural measures by EUR 150 million, including 24 million intended for instruments to tackle unemployment directly, such as the European Social Fund (ESF) and the EQUAL programme?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The EUR 150 000 cut in the allocation for the Structural Funds does not affect payment appropriations for 2006. It is, rather, a technical cut in payment appropriations, which the Council has justified by the fact that its estimate of the pace of budget management of payment appropriations in 2006 for measures already underway differs from that of the Commission.</p>
<p>This cut in no way affects commitment appropriations for current structural funds programmes for 2006, and will therefore have no impact on the Commission’s desire to boost the implementation of the Lisbon strategy by means of the cohesion policy.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fight against unemployment and discrimination in the labour market are among the priorities of the proposal for a new European Social Fund regulation for 2007-2013, which the Commission has submitted to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the utilisation of appropriations for the European Social Fund is proceeding very satisfactorily in 2005; at the end of August the utilisation rate was 69%. Accordingly, the budgetary authority, pursuant to the agreement reached during the 2005 budgetary procedure, should be asked to submit a supplementary and amending budget, in order to meet the projected payment needs between now and the end of the year.</p>

<p>This matter has however been discussed at other meetings between the Commission and Russia, most recently between the Commissioner in charge of External Relations and Presidential Aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky on 30 June. In response to the concerns expressed by the Parliament the Russian authorities have drawn attention to the financial support given to the development of the literature, broadcasting and cultural activities of the Finno-Ugric peoples in their own language in the Republic of Mari El.</p>
<p>The Commission lacks first hand information on this subject but continues to follow it to the extent possible. The Commission will continue to discuss the matter with the Russian authorities on appropriate occasions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0729"></a>

<p>The Commission and the Member States have set up a network to help consumers with cross-border consumer problems: the European Consumer Centres (ECC) Network.</p>
<p>The European Consumer Centres Network contributes to raising European citizens’ awareness of the possibility of such fraud.</p>

The Distance Selling Directive is part of the review. Once the diagnostic phase of this review is complete within 2006, the Commission will assess further steps. It could be that certain directives need to be changed, or adapted.</p>
<p>In the course of this review, the Commission will assess how the directives work in practice and whether new products or marketing techniques cause any detriment for consumers. It will analyse gaps and inconsistencies in the degree of consumer protection in the different directives.</p>
<p>The review of the consumer protection regulatory framework will involve extensive Member State and stakeholder consultation.

The Commissioner responsible has stated that there is now transparency and this facilitates the intention expressed by Greek governments for years to privatise OA, whose possible new owner could use State aid to cover the situation.</p>

<p>(EN) The decision of the Commission finding that Greece had granted illegal and incompatible State aid to Olympic was reached only after a full and exhaustive examination and investigation of the facts. This examination has given to Greece the possibility to provide the Commission with any relevant information, which have carefully been taken into consideration. The opening of this examination brought to the attention of Olympic and the Greek Government since March 2004 all the elements on which compatibility the Commission had doubts, and which have led to the recent decision.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to recall that, since 1994, the Commission has taken several decisions regarding Olympic Airways. More than 10 years ago, the Commission authorised the grating of State aid aimed at financing the restructuring of the airline. Nevertheless, in spite of modifications of the initial plan, agreed upon by the Commission, Greece did not comply with those decisions nor carry out this restructuring, leading to a first negative decision in 2002, for abusive and incompatible aid, and a second new one on 14 September for new incompatible aid granted since 2002. In May 2005, the European Court of Justice confirmed that Greece had failed to fulfil its obligations to recover the aid decided upon in 2002.</p>
<p>Since 1994, any decision regarding the evolution of Olympic therefore lies in the hands of Greece, which is fully informed of the EU competition rules and has pledged to abide by them when since it entered the Community. It has been constantly informed by the Commission of the problems raised by this specific case, and of the possible consequences and issues at stake.</p>
<p>As stated by those rules, the Commission is neutral as to the public or private ownership of Olympic. Its responsibility is to make sure that European Community law is equally applied to all airlines. Where necessary, those rules give Member States the possibility to make sure that public service obligations are correctly ensured and financed, provided that the public support complies with EU rules setting minimums standards for transparency and equality of treatment. This is the only way to ensure sustainable growth and employment in air transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0734"></a>

<p>(EN) Ensuring the protection of EU geographical indications (GIs) in third countries has been an objective of the EU’s commercial policy for a long time and all-the-more-so in the last few years, where the EC has successfully concluded bilateral agreements with Canada, Chile, South-Africa and has begun negotiations with the United States, Mercosur and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EC has also shown multilateral activity and has tabled a number of proposals in the World Trade Organization (WTO), both in the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Council and in the Committee of Agriculture, seeking to establish a multilateral register for geographical indications, the “extension” of the wine GI regime to all products and the “claw back” of a number of names which have been subject to interpretations of the TRIPs exceptions in a manner that hinders market access of products bearing those names.</p>
<p>Progress on these issues has been difficult. Negotiations on the wine register have been stalled since 1998. These negotiations are difficult because of opposition from new world wine producers on one hand, and from developing countries who feel they have nothing to gain from a wine register on the other hand. There is a need to ensure support from developing countries that support GIs generally as long as they apply to their products too – and not only to wines and spirits.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Ministerial Conference offers an opportunity for Ministers to take stock and provide guidance on this issue. The EC and other WTO Members “Friends of GIs” will continue to pursue their goals with a view to make progress on this issue. The EU will also continue to negotiate bilaterally with third countries to secure a legal environment in which our product bearing GIs can be traded in a global marketplace.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0745"></a>

<p>(EN) Concerning the assessment of the results achieved with the support of the Structural Funds, each Member State makes its own evaluation in the various sectors of application.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds have recently undertaken their own mid-term review for the 2000-2006 programming period and have allowed the Member States to adapt their programming documents, taking into account possible changes in the socioeconomic situation and the needs of different target groups as well as the findings of mid-term evaluations. This has led to qualitative shifts in a number of priority fields and provided an opportunity to better contribute to the priorities of the revised European Employment Strategy (EES) and to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the current period, for example, Greece benefits from Objective 1 funding; specifically it receives funding from the European Social Fund (ESF) which is designed to support education, training and employment policies, as well as the ERDF, EQUAL, URBAN II Programme and other European programmes such as SOCRATES for Education and LEONARDO DA VINCI for Vocational Training whose target groups include those mentioned in the question. Through its cooperation programmes in education and training the Community supports the development of new teaching and learning methodologies based on new technologies which promote the integration of learners in remote areas.</p>
<p>For the new period 2007-2013, the Commission, through the Structural and Cohesion Funds, Rural Development and other European programmes, proposes a more strategic approach in an effort to ensure that their content is targeted on growth and jobs. For this reason the framework of the Community Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion (CSG- part 5 "Taking account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy") contains a specific proposition for the development of Regions and Cities. The Community Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development place particular emphasis on considering the special needs of women and young people in rural areas in actions related to the diversification of the rural economy and quality of life. As regards young people in rural and remotes areas in particular, the ESF will act in a preventive way in order to prevent depopulation by supporting actions in the fields of education, training, lifelong learning and creating more and better jobs in the future, thus contributing to the social integration of young people.</p>
<p>Each Member State will ensure that the actions set out in the National Strategic Reference Framework and in the Operational Programmes will promote the objectives and priorities of the European Employment Strategy in order to face the problems of the above mentioned target groups.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0747"></a>

<p>Responsibility for disseminating information concerning wanted persons generally rests with police forces - Eurojust cannot therefore be involved in that process. As regards Europol, the task conferred on it by the convention focuses on the analysis and cross-referencing of information forwarded to it by the Member States prior to the judicial proceedings during which coercive measures, such as the issuing of an arrest warrant, are taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0749"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the report referred to by the Honourable Member, and it has met the authors both during its preparations and after it was published. The Commission has taken note that the report refers, on page 33, to the alleged "case of one agency using storage facilities in the east Jerusalem settlement industrial zone of Atarot".</p>
<p>According to what the Commission was able to establish, the information pertains to the World Food Programme (WFP). The latter explained that, whilst 85% of the food aid that it distributes in the Palestinian territories goes directly from the port of Ashdod to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, 15% of it is in fact stored at Atarot. This concerns, according to WFP, mainly food aid funded by the United States, but also some quantities of EU funded food aid (less than 3%). As far as the Commission could establish, there would be at the moment 83 MT of sugar funded under the EU budget line for humanitarian aid and 243 MT of chickpeas funded under the EU budget line for food security that are stored at Atarot. According to WFP, the main reason for this is operational, since Palestinian drivers have no access to the Ashdod.</p>
<p>The Commission was not aware of any programme of assistance that is using funds provided under the EU budget lines for humanitarian aid and food security to procure goods and/or services from illegally-established settlement-based enterprises, including the hiring of storage facilities at the above-mentioned settlement or in any other settlement. The Commission will take the appropriate action towards WFP in order to avoid that the storage facilities at Atarot continue to be used for the storage of EU funded aid.</p>
<p>In respect to the last sub-question, the Commission draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that Article 16 of its Framework Partnership Agreement with humanitarian organisations, which is the basis upon which financial aid for the implementation of humanitarian operation is granted, already prescribes, inter alia, that: "Humanitarian aid operations shall respect and promote the enforcement of international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles". It also draws the attention on preamble 2 of Council Regulation (EC) N° 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which reads: "Whereas civilian operations to protect the victims of fighting or of comparable exceptional circumstances are governed by international humanitarian law and should accordingly be considered part of humanitarian action".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of three recent epidemiological studies<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">,</span><a href="#defann_70_2" name="refann_70_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">, 3</span> of time trends in melanoma incidence and mortality in Europe, which are in line with European trends of an increase of melanoma incidence and mortality in the population as well as some improvements generally attributed to skin cancer prevention actions.</p>
<p>These studies have been supported by the Community action programme “Europe against Cancer” 1996-2002.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding prevention of all skin cancers the Commission supported the review and re-launch in 2003 of the European Code against Cancer, which includes the review of the actual epidemiological data and the scientific justification for evidence-based recommendations also on the prevention of skin cancer in its recommendation N°6<span class="sup">4</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is not aware of any long-term epidemiological studies on the relationship between the increase of natural UV intensity specifically-linked to ozone depletion in the atmosphere and its impact on skin cancer incidence in the Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, according to measurements of solar UV radiation over Europe carried out by the Joint Research Centre, the UV intensity does not show a substantial variation among the Member States. However, "Mini ozone holes" can be regularly observed over parts of Europe, which lead to locally/regionally higher UV intensity.</p>
<p>In addition, recent scientific evidence shows that increases in bromine, which is a component of many ozone-depleting substances, in the Arctic combined with very cold winters have resulted in high UV conditions being recorded in many parts of Europe. As high UV exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, eye cataracts, damages the human immuno-suppression, and reduces the production of some crops, the Commission is strongly encouraging the recovery of the ozone layer through the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 in the European Community which reflects actions agreed internationally in the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the Commission tabled a proposal for a Directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation). It should be pointed out, however, that the Parliament asked for natural radiations to be excluded from the scope of this Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission supports the balanced socio-economic development of Kaliningrad so that it does not fall behind its neighbours or indeed become isolated. Indeed, the Commission supports projects intended to further Kaliningrad’s integration with its EU neighbours, since this is one of the best ways of ensuring balanced socio-economic development.</p>
<p>Twelve Neighbourhood Programmes are due to be implemented on the EU’s eastern border in 2004-2006, including a Programme for Kaliningrad, Poland and Lithuania. Under the Russia-Lithuania-Poland Programme, Kaliningrad will benefit from a budget of €9.5 million for the next two years.</p>
<p>The Commission is making available more than €30 million to border crossing infrastructure in Kaliningrad. A number of crossings have been considered as priority. Bagrationovsk is the freight link between Kaliningrad and Poland, where construction was completed in Autumn 2003. Mamonovo II is another potentially important border crossing with Poland. Chernychevsky connects Kaliningrad to the rest of Russia through Lithuania and Belarus. Sovetsk lies on the Riga-Kaliningrad corridor.</p>
<p>Post-2006, Kaliningrad will be eligible for the increased funding proposed under the New Neighbourhood Instrument, demonstrating the importance the EU attaches to cross-border and regional co-operation on the external borders of the EU. The Commission will welcome projects which promote economic and social cohesion across borders, as well as cultural and educational exchange.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
