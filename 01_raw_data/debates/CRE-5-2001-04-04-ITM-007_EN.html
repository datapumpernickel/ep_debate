<p class="contents">As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Mihail Papayannakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0248_EN.html">H-0248/01</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Crisis in the Balkans</span></p>
<p class="contents">As developments in the Balkans crisis have revealed, recognition of the borders of many countries in the region is a matter of direct or indirect contention. A case in point is the border between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Serbia, on which the two countries themselves have agreed but which Albanian groups in FYROM itself and in Kosovo refuse to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council's view of these current developments and, in particular, what is its position on the acceptance of borders as a stabilising force in the Balkans crisis?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0259_EN.html">H-0259/01</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Uncontrolled activity of extremist organisations in southern Serbia</span></p>
<p class="contents">Terrorist activity by Albanian extremists in southern Serbia and FYROM, even within the KFOR-monitored zone, is out of control. Terrorist operations and fighting, even involving the use of heavy weaponry, are reported on an almost daily basis. The Yugoslav peace plan for the Presevo Valley has, in principle, received a favourable response.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree that the above peace plan constitutes a sufficient basis for talks? What measures will it take to facilitate the opening of talks between the political leaders of the Albanian-speaking population of southern Serbia and the Yugoslav leadership?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 3 by Efstratios Korakas (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0306_EN.html">H-0306/01</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Situation in FYROM and danger of a general conflagration in the Balkans</span></p>
<p class="contents">The armed and murderous attacks against FYROM by the illegal mercenary army of the UCK which has been strengthened and armed by NATO have intensified and are now threatening to further destabilise the Balkans, causing a general conflagration. Far from promoting stability, the presence of KFOR troops in FYROM actually causes further destabilisation. This is confirmed by media reports that armed mercenaries are crossing over from the German and American sectors unimpeded. All these attacks and developments are the result of the 'divide and rule' policy pursued by NATO and the EU, a policy which is advanced by inciting and exploiting nationalism and splinter groups and tendencies with the aim of setting up protectorates in the region in order better to exploit its wealth and peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">What specific steps does the Council intend to take to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99, to safeguard the territorial inviolability of FYROM and to put an end to all foreign interference in the Balkans?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> The Council has repeatedly expressed its deep concern at the great tensions and extensive violence in southern Serbia and the increased number of incidents in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia particularly close to the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – incidents that the Council strongly condemned in its conclusions of 26 February. On the same occasion the Council repeated that it stands firmly by the principle that all the borders in the area are inviolable. Since then the European Union has been actively engaged in attempting to solve the crisis in close cooperation with the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO/KFOR and the authorities in FYROM.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also stated that it is prepared to continue to give practical support to the efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict with full respect for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. With a view to this the Union welcomes the High Representative Mr Solana’s decision to station further significant numbers of observers – up to 30 – from the Union’s observation mission in southern Serbia, this since at the Council’s conference (General Affairs) on 19 March, following contact with NATO and following the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the parties, he assessed that the safety of the observers was carefully guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions of 19 March the Council supported the initiative by the authorities in Belgrade to find a peaceful and permanent solution to the current situation in southern Serbia. This initiative, which was presented to the European Union Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy by Serbia’s Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Covic, and the Foreign Minister of the Yugoslav Federation, Mr Svilanovic, is considered to form a suitable basis for continued activity. At this time the Commission announced that it would double its financial support in the Presevo Valley. This support now amounts to nearly EUR 2 million. The Commission is also considering what contributions can be made to Serbia in the long term in accordance with the EUR 240 million programme in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">As confirmation of the Council’s commitment the honourable Members of Parliament should be aware of the fact that a representative of the High Representative Javier Solana actively participated – together with a representative of the Secretary-General of NATO – in the negotiations which, on 13 March 2001, resulted in the Serbian and Albanian representatives signing the cease-fire agreement and to a dialogue being started between the Yugoslav-Serbian authorities and the Presevo Albanian representatives on 23 March.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council welcomed Javier Solana’s status report, submitted on 19 March, concerning further EU measures in respect of south-east Serbia and urged him to continue his work on an EU strategy for this region in cooperation with the presidency and the Commission in order to support the process in the region and contribute to international efforts in reaching a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council reacted quickly and clearly to the serious incidents in FYROM that took place recently. The ministerial troika visited Skopje on 22 March and Mr Solana visited FYROM on a further two occasions, on 20 and 26-27 March. The Council entirely rejects the tendentious and unfounded allegations in the honourable Member of Parliament’s question No 306 concerning the role of NATO and KFOR in the crisis in FYROM. The EU position is clearly stated in the declaration by the European Council issued in Stockholm on 23 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it is, of course, very important to bring about an intensification of the interethnic dialogue in various ways. One of the reasons why we have had a continual presence of Union representatives in the region in recent weeks is precisely in order to be able to promote this interethnic dialogue within the framework of the respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. In general terms, the Union – in the Council’s opinion – should continue to do everything to promote this dialogue, whilst always having these fundamental principles in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You mentioned his name five times and maybe it is better to leave him out of it when we are discussing the Balkans. But to get back to the point of my question. Your standpoint has one positive aspect – the Council’s determination not to violate all the borders in the area. What I should like to ask, just to clarify matters and to stop playing with words, is: do we assume and do we mean that the borders of the whole of Yugoslavia, a Yugoslavia with no more Milosevic, a Yugoslavia with Milosevic in prison, also include Kosovo? I raise this with all due respect for the comments made to the effect that, if this problem is not resolved, we shall have continuing instability in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that although we are seeing a lot of human suffering in the areas in question, I still believe that the Union’s very active work has helped limit the suffering and that now, following some very difficult weeks, we can actually see a light in an otherwise very gloomy situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say that we in the Union – which also includes Mr Solana, who has really worked hard on this matter together with Mr Patten and the Swedish Presidency – can really be proud of what we have achieved, although it is not yet sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution makes provision for Kosovo to be a province of Serbia, KLA criminals to be disarmed and the borders to be guarded by Yugoslavian forces, whereas it was the presence of KFOR, with the blessing of the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, which facilitated both the attacks in southern Serbia, in the Presevo valley, and the invasion of KLA criminals into FYROM. And the question here, Mr President, is who gave Robertson, the NATO secretary-general, the right to move in and pressurise the FYROM government into negotiating with these criminals? And Mr Solana did the same. Is this what they mean by their determination to guard the borders? Tell us once and for all, is Kosovo a Serbian province or an independent state? And then, Mr President, I was struck by the presidency’s statement that Presevo...</p>

I would like to raise the matter of the forthcoming debate in the Bulgarian national assembly on the free passage of NATO forces without the need for prior approval by parliament, the first time this has been allowed in a non-NATO country. There is also talk of leaving unmanned American aeroplanes on Bulgarian territory. What I am wondering is, does ΝΑΤΟ intend to use Bulgaria against FYROM in the same way as it used FYROM against Yugoslavia? At the same time, people protesting in Bulgaria against the country’s involvement with NATO are being persecuted and protestors from the new “Che Guevara” movement have been arrested and tried on charges of hooliganism. All this indicates the risk of a crisis spreading in Bulgaria. I should like to ask if the Council has faced up to such a possibility and thought out any action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by Brian Crowley (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0290_EN.html">H-0290/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: International Criminal Court</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council indicate its position on the slow ratification process of the proposed International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that it cannot be formally established until 60 countries have ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and that, in February 2001, Dominica became the 29th State to ratify the Statute?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question no 5 by Olivier Dupuis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0299_EN.html">H-0299/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: International Criminal Court</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its answer dated 24 October 2000 to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0763_EN.html">H-0763/00</a><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning the process for the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Council Presidency stated that it was also possible to envisage substantial progress being made in the near future, since eight more Member States were quietly confident that ratification would take place before the end of the year. However, the first three months of 2001 have now elapsed, but only four more Member States have ratified the Statute. Furthermore, the Council also stated in its answer that three other Member States had reiterated their intention to ratify (sic) but had noted that some procedural or constitutional problems still remained. Can the Council indicate the type of procedural or constitutional problems to be solved by the Member States, the progress made in the ratification procedures in each of the Member States which have not yet ratified the Statute (Denmark, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and its assessment of the likelihood that the ratification process will be concluded in those seven Member States by 18 July 2001, a date which will mark the third (!) anniversary of the conclusion of the Rome Conference?</p>

Where the national courts cannot or will not act, the international community has the ultimate responsibility for guaranteeing that justice is done. The Union therefore considers it necessary for the International Criminal Court to be set up within the near future in order to increase respect for international humanitarian rights and human rights. By abolishing immunity from prosecution, the Court will reinforce the rule of law and justice and contribute to consolidating world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union strongly recommends that the International Criminal Court be set up in the near future. With this aim in mind the Union started international efforts to encourage as many states as possible to sign up to the Rome Statute before the deadline expired on 31 December 2000. The Union has also undertaken to encourage the countries with associate membership of the Union to sign or ratify the Statute and the Union is offering its expertise in this area to all interested countries. Moreover, the Union is firmly resolved to give its support to the actual setting up of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union expects the Rome Statute to enter into force in the near future, when the 60 ratifications required have been achieved, including ratification by all the Union’s Member States. Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and Finland have already ratified the Rome Statute. The other Member States have all started the ratification process and in the majority of cases it should soon be completed, depending on the national procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it should be noted that the implementation of the Rome Statute in national legislation is a demanding task which, in a number of cases, even requires constitutional amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation concerning the ratification of the Rome Statute in the Union is regularly taken up by the presidency at meetings of the Council’s working group on international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding the question of whether the Charter is to be regarded as legally binding in all respects, in December 2000 – as the honourable Member knows – the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice approved a declaration concerning the future of the Union which specifies that the question of the status of the Charter is one of the issues to be taken up in conjunction with the preparatory work to be carried out before 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">It was agreed that when this work has been carried out a new Intergovernmental Conference would be convened to discuss the status of the Charter, amongst other things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Distortion of competition resulting from national compensation schemes for military purchasing</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 15 December the Belgian Federation decided to discontinue the practice of linking its military purchases to economic compensation schemes for firms in Flanders and Wallonia. The cabinet's notification of an order for night-glasses says: 'The cabinet confirms that clauses on economic compensation will not be included in any further orders'. Hitherto the cabinet had endeavoured, as far as possible, to place orders involving billions of francs for the armed forces with 'Belgian' firms. These compensatory schemes were always shrouded in an atmosphere of protectionism and wheeling-and-dealing because the decision-making process did not reflect the market mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">What initiative will the Council take in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to ensure that the fifteen EU Member States follow the Belgian example and put an end to any national compensatory schemes for military purchases?</p>

I do not know whether to laugh or cry. Whilst all of Europe is wondering how it should start to act as a united front in its defence policy, for example after the Kosovo war, you are coming up with this response. I am really starting to question the Council’s validity. You were absent during the foot-and-mouth debate, as well as during the debate on the discharge. The discharge, as granted by the Council, was an illustration of bad craftsmanship pure and simple. I cannot understand why you are simply fobbing us off with such a response. Indeed, Article 296 of the Treaty on European Union imposes a few restrictions on yourselves in this respect. However, you could also start applying Article 296(2), and you could at least ask the Commission to ensure that you have authority to act in this field. At a time when a Member State is finally abandoning economic compensations and moving away from dubious practices, I find the Council’s response in this matter unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the conclusions to these the Council confirms that it will apply the institutional agreement of 6 May 1999 in full. However, the Council emphasises that it is important to make a sufficiently large margin available under the various ceilings in the budget plan when the budget is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards financial repercussions of the BSE crisis, the Council would remind you that, in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council summit in Nice, both the budget plan and the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline must be observed even if new measures or supplementary measures are required.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not consider that the budget framework on which the European Council agreed in Berlin and which was confirmed in Nice is any obstacle to effective measures being taken to deal with the problems currently facing the beef market.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework has not prevented the Council from agreeing on important measures in respect of public health in order to restore consumer confidence. In particular, in February the Council adopted a common position on a Regulation establishing provisions for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Once this has been approved by the Council and European Parliament it will provide a framework for sustainable production.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently discussing the package of measures put forward by the Commission in February, the aim of which is to deal with the disequilibrium in the market for beef within the Union in both the short term and the long term and to raise the quality.</p>
<p class="contents">In the financing summary accompanying the proposal the Commission shows how the financial consequences of such measures can be met within the budget plan. At the meeting of the Ecofin Council on 12 February in conjunction with the Council’s adoption of the proposal for supplementary and amending budget 1/2001 in respect of BSE-related measures, Commissioner Schreyer said that depending on developments in the market, the Commission would consider legislative initiatives to cover the risk of further costs in the budget with a view to observing the financial frameworks of Agenda 2000. The Council therefore feels that the Commission should be able to implement the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy without this being affected by BSE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what happened in Nice and what is happening again today with mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth. The European Union and, above all, the Council, must therefore not avert their eyes from the fact that an issue as significant as reforming the CAP cannot wait until 2006 and that such a reform requires changes to the structure of the European budget and profound changes to the tight financial perspective of Agenda 2000. Is the Council really willing to adapt Agenda 2000 should this be made necessary by serious practical problems such as mad cow disease, for example, which are affecting certain countries particularly seriously, such as my own, Galicia, thereby avoiding a situation in which, to the incomprehension and confusion of Europe’s citizens, the Union denies itself recourse to the political weapons it has at its disposal? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have an excellent knowledge of this protocol and do not need this summing up. The question revolves around a very central issue. The Danish debate is about Denmark’s being able, via intergovernmental agreements, to be associated with parts of what is known as the third pillar, in other words parts of this section of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and I can tell from what the President-in-Office of the Council said that no decision has been reached. The Council has not entered into such an agreement so far, but I am aware – and the President-in-Office can presumably confirm this – that as far as, at any rate, one particular central issue is concerned, namely the EURODAC system, negotiations between the EU institutions and Denmark are under way. Am I to understand the answer as saying that the Council is unaware of these negotiations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I put a written question to the Council, I was told that the Council did not know. How is it possible that the Council did not know? Does the presidency of the Council know which body paid and how much the payment was?

<p class="contents">When, in 2000, Saudi Arabia took over the presidency of the GCC, two such meetings were held at ministerial level: one in the common EU-GCC council and another in conjunction with the UN’s General Assembly in September.

<p class="contents">The EU will continue to emphasise to GCC members the necessity of improving the human rights situation in their countries and will continue to cooperate with the UN and international human rights organisations.

<p class="contents">The Council would nonetheless remind you that there are no agreements or any separate political dialogue between the European Union and Saudi Arabia.

Does this not discriminate against fleets according to their geographical distribution and habitual fishing areas?

Against the background of the scientific opinion from the International Marine Research Council, recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to during 2001 and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question, the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake, or what is known as the Northern stock, at 22 623 tonnes – ‘and four kilos’. On the basis of Article 15 of the Council’s Regulation No 3760/92, the Commission is, at present, considering a series of measures to promote the recovery of the stock.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would call attention to the fact that the Northern stock is a biological concept. The Member States’ catch allocations are divided up on the basis of the International Marine Research Council’s administrative divisions with a view to complying with the principle of relative stability laid down in the aforesaid Regulation and in the accession document of 1985. According to this principle, only Denmark and Sweden may fish in the area comprising the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, and only Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in those areas comprising the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 161 of the 1985 accession document establishes Spain’s share of hake from the northern stock in Divisions Vb, VI, VII and VIIIab, that is to say the western waters including the Bay of Biscay, at 30 per cent. Spain has no rights in the divisions comprising the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea.</p>

<p class="contents">Pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which lays down the principle that discrimination on the grounds of disability must be avoided, the Council consulted the European Parliament in February 2000 on the proposal for a directive on this subject<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In Article 2 thereof, the Council and Parliament agreed on the definition of direct and indirect discrimination, but those definitions seem to have been forgotten when Open Competition COM/A/12/98, the results of which are covered by the new Directive, was held. Out of the 645 candidates entered on the reserve lists, not a single one is disabled. Some visually impaired candidates took part in the competition, but, given the mark scheme used by the Commission, whereby twice as many marks are awarded to the written tests and to the tests involving graphics than to the reasoning and oral tests, their marks were significantly lower than those of the normally-sighted candidates. Does not the Council see in this instance a case of indirect discrimination against this group of candidates?</p>

The presidency also had the privilege of appearing before Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries on 6 February 2001, when we gave an exhaustive presentation of our priorities within the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">A question concerning what the presidency has done to promote the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry is, on the one hand, very general and wide-ranging, because it does not prioritise any particular measures or policy areas. On the other hand, it is also of limited scope because the common fisheries policy ought to include farther reaching considerations than the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency’s overriding priority is, and remains, that of ensuring that the fisheries sector is accorded robust and sustainable development through re-establishing a balance between fleet capacity and fishing activity, on the one hand, and accessible fishing stocks on the other. The Swedish ministers for agriculture and fisheries explained in detail in February how important it is to take a general view of the common fisheries policy, to have a more effective policy for the fishing fleet now that the current multiannual guidance programmes have ceased to apply, to devise a strategy for integrating environmental considerations into the common fisheries policy, to apply the precautionary principle and to have multiannual strategies for establishing Total Allowable Catches.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 March, the Commission submitted its green paper on the future of the multiannual guidance programmes and, on 16 March, its communication about the integration of environmental protection requirements into the multiannual guidance programmes. A programme of measures to promote biological diversity in the fishing industry was expected to be available from 28 March, that is to say last week. At its meeting in December 2000, the Council also began its debate on the Commission’s communication concerning the application of the precautionary principle and multiannual agreements for establishing annual allowable catches.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the presidency’s intention to progress as far as possible with this work at the Council’s meetings on 25 April and 18 June 2001. We also hope that we shall be able to present parts of an integration strategy in anticipation of the European Council in Gothenburg in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Council meeting in December 2000, work has progressed on establishing recovery plans for cod and hake in Community waters. The Commission’s regulations on cod in the North Sea already exist, and measures regarding hake are under consideration. Moreover, we shall soon be embarking on the second phase, in which improved technical measures will be established where these species are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has adopted a regulation establishing measures to be applied during 2001 for the purpose of restoring cod stocks in the Irish Sea. It will also shortly be adopting a further amendment to the regulation concerning certain technical measures designed to conserve fish stocks. The amendment will ensure greater selectivity in fishing, as well as the protection of young fish.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also recently adopted a mandate for the Commission to negotiate a cooperation agreement on fisheries with the Russian Federation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps the timing was not right, maybe I should table this question again in June, so that he could outline even further what the Council should have done and account for its stewardship over a six-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Green Paper on the review of the common fisheries policy, which is all important, particularly to my own country. You will realise that, President, having been an active member of the Committee on Fisheries in the past. It is important to redress the imbalances of the past. The quota and the TACs which the Irish, sharing their prolific fishing grounds with the larger countries, receive was a bad deal. I hope, over the next few months, that we will have an opportunity to impress upon our colleagues in Parliament and ministers in the various Member States the importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the time constraints, I will leave it at that and not ask the Minister to give me a response in view of Mr Fitzsimons' interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 19 by James (Jim) Fitzsimons (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0294_EN.html">H-0294/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Human-induced climate change</span></p>
<p class="contents">A UN Science working party adopted a report in Shanghai last January which concluded that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. A second group, meeting in Geneva, concluded that current rates of human-induced climate change would have irreversible impacts such as melting ice sheets, increased river flooding in Europe and increased risk of flooding in coastal areas, and erosion. The greatest impact would be felt by those least able to protect themselves from rising sea levels, an increase in disease, and a decrease in agricultural production in the developing countries in Asia and Africa. What is the Council's response to these conclusions?</p>
