<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rajoy Brey,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the European Parliament for giving me this opportunity to appear here to give my assessment of the progress we have made during the four and a half months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in what I believe to be one of the key areas of the European Union’s Justice and Home Affairs policy; immigration and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The progressive development of a common immigration and asylum policy is an essential part of the area of freedom, security and justice we Europeans have proposed creating in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">This immigration and asylum policy must be based on a balanced and global approach. This global framework, in accordance with the Conclusions of the Tampere European Council, must be founded on four fundamental premises: the adequate management of migratory flows, the quest for fair treatment of third-country nationals, cooperation with countries of origin and the establishment of a European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">Making progress on these four guidelines was the inspiration behind the Spanish programme of objectives and priorities for the Presidency of the Council of the Union. All of this taking good account of the renewed impetus provided by the Laeken European Council of 14 and 16 December 2001, which put the emphasis on the necessary balance between the protection of refugees in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1951, the legitimate aspiration for a better life and the Union and its Member States’ capacity for receiving refugees. Furthermore, we have tried to prioritise those instruments which the Laeken Conclusions considered most urgent to adopt, such as the Global Action plan to combat illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with these ideas, I am going to try to organise my comments on the progress over these months in the field of asylum and immigration by dealing with what I believe must be the two main sources of inspiration for this policy: progress towards a European asylum system and the appropriate regulation of migratory flows, in accordance with the following premises: respect for legality, the fair treatment of third-country nationals, cooperation with States of origin and the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">On the establishment of a common European asylum system, we have taken very important steps at these last two formal Councils of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. I would like to highlight the directive establishing the minimum rules for the acceptance of asylum seekers in the Member States. This proposal intends to guarantee that asylum seekers arriving in our States enjoy a minimum level of rights essential to a dignified life, including housing, free movement, family regrouping, schooling and education for children, access to employment and professional training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, following its meeting of 25 April, has achieved a general political orientation on the text of the directive and now we must study the proposals contained in Parliament’s opinion and establish the position of the fifteen States with regard to the contents of the opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this same field of asylum, I would like to concentrate on another legislative instrument, which we approved on 28 February and which seems to me to be extremely important: the Council Regulation establishing certain rules for the implementation of Regulation No 2725/2000 on the creation of the "Eurodac" system.</p>
<p class="contents">Having created the Eurodac system in December 2000, implementation rules became necessary to establish the procedures for identifying asylum seekers by means of an electronic comparison of their fingerprints. This will facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention which, as you well know, determines the Member State responsible for the examination of asylum applications.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second section of my speech on the progress made so far during the six months of our Presidency, I am going to focus on the key elements of our immigration policy, which is governed by the central idea of the appropriate management of migratory flows, which includes both the idea of legally regulating those flows in accordance with the fair treatment of third-country nationals, and combating clandestine immigration, in particular human trafficking, governed by the idea of cooperation with countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we have tried to make progress with the gradual unification of our visa systems. To this end, at the General Affairs Council on 18 February, both regulations were approved, establishing a uniform model for visas and a uniform model for the form for issuing a visa granted by Member States to holders of a travel document not recognised by the Member State issuing that form. At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council of 24 April, we supplemented these rules with the Council Decision approving a uniform model for visa applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with this unification, we have also achieved a general approach for the Regulation establishing a uniform model residence permit for third-country nationals. Amongst other advantages, this regulation will help in the recognition of documents by police border control authorities, which will benefit their holders and will help with better detection of false documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to financially support certain actions proposed by the Member States aimed at promoting cooperation and coordination between national administrations and the transparent application of Community legislation, in the fields of immigration, asylum and borders, at the last Council in April all the Member States reached a general agreement for the approval of the ARGO Programme, which will be in force for five years and will receive EUR 25 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is no doubt that the appropriate management of flows requires the adoption of effective measures to combat clandestine immigration, in particular human trafficking. In this respect, the Conclusions of the Laeken European Council urged the approval of a Global Plan, which we were able to discuss at the informal meeting of Ministers in Santiago de Compostela and which we formally adopted at our meeting of Ministers on 28 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Very much inspired by the Commission Communication of November 2001, the Plan is designed to be a programming guide, which will help with the planning of actions which we can start to implement in order to effectively combat the phenomenon of illegal immigration. Allow me to briefly explain the main actions and measures included in this Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, visa policy; secondly, the promotion of the exchange and analysis of information relating to the problem of illegal immigration; thirdly, the plan deals with a series of measures prior to the crossing of borders; fourthly, the plan focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of border controls; fifthly, another aspect dealt with by the plan are the policies of readmission and repatriation; sixthly, the operative role of Europol in the fight against human trafficking will be increased; and finally the Plan includes many repressive measures to combat these crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now a question of making progress with the necessary protection and assistance for victims, the fight against illegal contracting by employers, the confiscation of the proceeds from this trafficking and of the means of transport used, and to make it obligatory for transporters to meet the costs of the repatriation of foreigners who do not meet the requirements for legal entry.</p>
<p class="contents">This plan has borne fruit, ladies and gentlemen. Thus, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council following its approval, we adopted certain measures in compliance with it. Likewise, the Council Conclusions on illegal immigration and human trafficking by sea. These Conclusions seek an integral response by the European Union to the massive arrival of immigrants by sea, on the basis of the notion that migratory issues must have a prominent place in the EU’s external relations. In my opinion, this is a fundamental issue which we must be very conscious of and, above all, we must act accordingly and as quickly as possible. I repeat, migratory issues must have a prominent place in the EU’s external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning more directly to Justice and Home Affairs issues, we are going to prioritise measures such as the carrying out of a study to improve the control of sea borders, prevention, and the adoption of operative measures, in particular the exchange of information, which is already yielding very good results, and we are going to strongly urge States of origin and transit States to combat human trafficking and readmit illegal immigrants who leave their territory, amongst other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as our Heads of State and Government requested in Laeken, we have gone ahead with the determination of a list of third countries with which we must negotiate new readmission agreements, setting the general criteria for that determination.</p>
<p class="contents">During April we have also carried out a risk assessment operation in the main airports of the European Union, known as the RÍO operation, whose results, which I presented during the Council held on 25 April, will allow us to improve the cooperation between the border control authorities of the Member States and Europol, and also to ascertain the methods, routes and other procedures employed for the clandestine introduction of immigrants into European Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Also with a view to this type of cooperation, during this six-month period, the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Borders and Asylum has met for the first time, with the participation of the Heads of the External Border Control Services. This meeting, which is to take place periodically every six months, has established a strategy for improving the operative cooperation of Member States in relation to the control of external borders, in aspects such as risk assessment systems, the situation of our sea borders, and specific training for our agents running border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have improved the mechanisms to resolve the situation of foreigners who do not fulfil, or who have ceased to fulfil, the conditions for entry or residence, by means of Conclusions on the obtaining of travel documents for the implementation of repatriations.</p>
<p class="contents">From another point of view, and as I suggested at the beginning of this speech, in order to manage migratory flows properly, it is essential to promote cooperation between the countries of origin, transit and destination. In recent months, we have intensified the Union’s external relations in this area. I would very briefly like to mention the contacts we have held.</p>
<p class="contents">As a follow-up to the meeting of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 28 February, we held a meeting with the candidate countries during which we dealt, amongst other things, with the control of external borders. At this meeting, we communicated a catalogue of recommendations and best practices in relation to the control of external borders and admission and expulsion procedures within the Schengen area, which we had approved that same day.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, and for the first time within the Union, the fifteen Member States held a meeting with the Russian Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, during which we dealt, amongst other things, with the issue of migration, the management of borders and the readmission policy, and we also communicated to the Russian representatives the catalogue of recommendations I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, at the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Valencia of 22 and 23 April, we dealt with cooperation in the field of the social integration of immigrants, migration and the movement of people, and to this end we approved a regional programme within the Valencia Action Plan. Furthermore, this Plan indicates the will of the parties to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference focussing on the issue of migration and the social integration of immigrants during the second half of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention in particular the Conference on Migration, held within the framework of the ASEM process, in Lanzarote, on 4 and 5 April. This initiative, which stemmed from the Summit of ASEM Heads of State in Peking in October 2000, has served to lay the foundations for dialogue and cooperation between both parts of the world on the general situation of immigration, the management of migratory flows and the fight against illegal immigration. As a result of this meeting, a Declaration was approved which stresses the need for cooperation between Europe and Asia in order to organise migratory flows in an integrated fashion and which specifies, amongst other aspects, the establishment of a network of national points of contact for continuing the dialogue and developing future actions.</p>
<p class="contents">So far my speech has focussed on the concrete results achieved over recent months. I would also like to stress the significant impetus which has been given by the various working groups to the different legislative instruments, in the field of both asylum and of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm that there has been considerable progress on the work on the proposed Council Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for an asylum application, known as Dublin II, or the directive establishing minimum rules on the status of the refugee. In the same way and in accordance with the modified proposals on the minimum rules for the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status and on family regrouping, which the Commission presented on 30 April, we will promote the continuation of the work to move these issues forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the Commission has recently presented the Green Paper on a Community policy of returning illegal residents and the communication on "Guidelines for the integrated management of external borders", and we will try to ensure that it is studied by the competent bodies of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the field of legal immigration, significant progress has been made on the discussion of a proposed directive regulating the status of non-EU long-term residents and the directive relating to the conditions for entry and residence for the purposes of employed and self-employed work. Under our Presidency a study has begun of a proposed directive on the issuing of short-term residency permits to victims of human trafficking who cooperate with the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, within this section on progress made, I would like to refer to the promotion of European Union action plans with third countries. In particular, in relation to the dialogue with Morocco, there has been progress in the work of the ‘Social Affairs and migrations’ group, which held its second meeting on 12 March of this year in Rabat. I would also like to stress that the High-Level Group on Immigration and Asylum has agreed to send a mission of experts to Morocco to assess a border control programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my speech by very briefly explaining our work perspectives until 30 June 2002. At the last sitting of the Council of Ministers on 13 and 14 June, the Spanish Presidency will deal with the issue of creating a Visa Database, with regard to which we have consulted the guidelines of the common system for the exchange of visa information. In June we intend to present for your approval draft Council Conclusions which will indicate to the Commission which aspects must be considered and examined in the viability study. This system will represent a further step in the implementation of the Global Plan against illegal immigration and human trafficking and will prevent the issuing of a visa by a consulate of one country of the Union when it has already been refused by another consulate of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this month we expect the results to be presented of a viability study on European border policy which, under the auspices of Italy, is being developed by a working group which also includes representatives from Germany, Belgium, France and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to submit a proposal for a decision to the Council on the signing of the readmission agreement negotiated with Hong Kong and the draft negotiation mandate for the Commission in relation to an agreement of this type with the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if during these months sufficient progress is made on the proposed Regulation known as Dublin II, we will submit it for discussion at the final Council of our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by once again thanking the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino for the fundamental role they have played in these efforts, which would not have been possible without their help. I would also like to thank Parliament for its dedication and cooperation, which have given great impetus to the European Union’s policy on immigration and asylum during the almost five months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the assessment of results and perspectives is positive and I can confirm that we are fulfilling many of those objectives which were contained in our working programme and which I was able to present to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 4 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and, in particular, thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

Secondly, because there is a close connection, as the Vice-President has just made clear, between external relations policy and immigration – both legal immigration and illegal trafficking in human beings – and related issues. Those were issues that we managed with strong leadership from the Spanish presidency to discuss at the recent meeting of the Mediterranean partners in Valencia, and I shall come back to them later. I was able to discuss these issues as well myself on a recent visit to the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission very much welcomed the conclusions adopted at the Laeken European Council and especially the confirmation of its commitment to the policy guidelines and objectives defined in 1999 in the second semester at Tampere. The Commission supports the new impetus to reduce the backlog in the fields of immigration and asylum legislation defined in the scoreboard which was established to review progress on the creation of an area of "freedom, security and justice". We are delighted that the Spanish presidency has given a new dynamism to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worthwhile recalling that the main proposals necessary for the implementation of Article 63 of the Treaty and the Tampere conclusions are already on the table. Therefore it is mainly up to the Council to speed up its work. The political agreement at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council on the proposal on laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States signified the start of much-needed movement in this direction. The Commission is once again grateful for the efforts of the Spanish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations are under way regarding two other legislative proposals on asylum, namely a Council Regulation on criteria and a mechanism for establishing responsibility for examining asylum applications to replace the Dublin Convention, as well as a Council directive on the qualification and status of persons as refugees or as beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. The Commission will also pursue the implementation of the Eurodac system as quickly as possible in the hope that Member States will soon make the necessary provisions to take part.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other subjects under discussion, the Commission will continue to contribute to the follow-up and the outcome of all these debates. In that sense, we warmly welcomed the rapid adoption of the Action Plan on the fight against illegal migration and human trafficking, which was based on our communication. As promised, the Commission will swiftly take the necessary steps to ensure its implementation. The first initiatives have already been taken, as the Commission has adopted the Green Paper on a Community return policy on illegal residents. In view of the highly complex nature and sheer scale of this phenomenon, the primary aim of the Green Paper is to launch a debate and to sound out all the interested parties. The Commission has also recently launched a communication on the integrated management of the European Union’s external borders. This issue will be considered on a Community-wide basis rather than as a set of national systems and will, I very much hope, map out the route to the longer-term objective of setting up a European corps of border guards or police.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, following the Laeken invitation, the Commission tabled a new amended proposal on family reunification on 2 May in order to make it easier to find a consensus on this extremely sensitive issue. As also requested by the Laeken Summit, the Commission will also shortly bring forward an amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission supported the willingness expressed in Laeken to better integrate migration policy with the external policy of the Union. It would therefore welcome any initiative aimed at giving a new perspective to the High Level Working group on Asylum and Immigration that was created by the Council in 1999. Its mandate merits an update so that it is brought into line with the current situation. The Commission intends to present a proposal of programme cooperation with third countries before the end of the year. It will be based on the experience gleaned from the implementation of the new budgetary instrument created by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say how much importance both António Vitorino and I attach to this particular issue: the relationship between the subjects we are debating this afternoon and external policy. There is plainly an intimate connection between our success, for example, in promoting sustainable development and demographic pressures. There is clearly an important role for us to play in helping other countries to deal with illegal trafficking in human beings, which is just as much a threat and, in some cases, a greater threat to them than it is to those richer countries which are the targets for those who traffic in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Over Easter I was in China and was able to take further the discussions that we had begun, thanks to the initiative taken by Zhu Rongji on how we can assist to develop programmes in China, which will make it less likely that people will put themselves into the hands of those who seek to move other human beings around the world, sometimes with fatal consequences, as we saw at Dover a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been very impressed by the positive way in which the Chinese authorities, led, I repeat by Mr Zhu Rongji, have responded to our own ideas, and I hope that we will have in place shortly some viable programmes in areas such as information and training, which will help to deal with a very serious problem for China and for us as well. This is, of course, a model for what we want to do in other places.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of re-admission, the Commission is about to finalise an agreement with Sri Lanka. This is the second agreement at Community level of this kind, the first one, I am delighted to say, having being concluded with Hong Kong. The Commission will continue its efforts to achieve the other agreements for which it has the mandate to negotiate and will table the necessary proposals to extend this approach in as coherent a manner as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in line with its communications concerning the introduction of open methods of coordination both for immigration and asylum, the Commission will shortly propose the implementation of a European system of information exchange on migration, asylum and countries of origin, as called for by the European Council. The new action plan on statistics requested by the Council in May of last year, the development of the activities of a virtual European Observatory on migration and the take-over of the Council committee on exchange of information activities by the Commission will all be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the extremely important question of the integration of migrants, the Commission wants to complement the instruments which have been developed in the fight against discrimination and racism with some new specific initiatives in this field. This is an exceptionally important area for us and we should not have needed recent electoral manifestations in order to convince us of the importance of this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I want to thank Parliament for allowing me to fill in for my colleague. I say, as a fellow Commissioner, that all of us in the Commission are very well aware of the enormous importance of this subject politically, and I am certainly aware of its enormous importance in the discharge of my principal responsibilities in the area of external relations.</p>

It is also an essential instrument in combating poverty and the social imbalances in the world and, furthermore – and this must be stated clearly – it is necessary to the maintenance of growth and prosperity in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is the case that migratory flows towards the European Union have increased dramatically in recent times and our capacity for reception is not unlimited. So much so that it is no exaggeration to say, as the Council has pointed out, that proper management of immigration is Europe’s greatest challenge today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the immigrants we can receive are protected by and subject to the law, that they assume the rights and obligations that implies and that they fully integrate into the society receiving them and share the values on which that society is based with the other citizens. It is proven that illegality leads to marginalisation. We must therefore prioritise the fight against the illegal trafficking in human beings, that is, against organised crime and mafias, in close cooperation with the third countries of origin and transit, and we must demand greater commitments from some of them. I would ask the Commission to produce and present a report to this House on this issue, because the desire to reach readmission agreements is essential in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Commissioner Vitorino that there is a link between foreign policy and immigration policy. Both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission are promoting greater cooperation in police and diplomatic areas, including, of course, the visa policy, which I believe – and Commissioner Patten will surely agree with me – can perfectly well fall within the framework of the work to create a common European diplomatic corps.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also consider economic aid for specific cases such as the Canary Islands, for example, where there is a shortage of reception centres to deal properly with the flood of refugees and immigrants who find themselves in an illegal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe it is time to leave behind demagoguery and irresponsible statements. My group believes – and I propose – that the time has come for a great European pact on immigration which excludes this issue from party political confrontation.</p>

<p class="contents">For a moment I thought this morning that Mr Rajoy would come here to communicate the good news of a new immigration policy which – according to Mr Aznar – was going to counterbalance these errors of European Socialism which have led to the emergence of the extreme right. I am delighted to see that this is not the case, that you have settled for an explanation of the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, the main approach of the European Council’s proposals over recent months. I am delighted about this and I am therefore only going to speak about this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we also have differing points of view on this, Minister. As Mr Patten has said, we have on the table a legislative working programme – but not only that – presented by the Commission following the Tampere conclusions. Two and a half years after that Council there has been little progress. You have mentioned some progress and I will return to that.</p>
<p class="contents">This has an impact on both the content and on interinstitutional relations. I am referring to cooperation with Parliament. I must say, Minister, that we are perplexed by situations such as the one created by the approval in the Council of the proposal on admission conditions for asylum seekers. We are perplexed because you tell us that you are going to look at what Parliament’s proposals are. I must tell you that they are proposals on a first draft which bears no relation to the one adopted and it will be difficult for us to go on working like this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the same problem with the common rules on entry for residence, the body of rights for third-country citizens. For us, all of this takes the form of concrete proposed directives the results of which we have not seen during these years following Tampere. You tell me that there have been results. I would like to ask you what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration is a part of this immigration policy which is yet to become a common European policy, but I believe that it would be much more effective if it were part of a genuine common structure of immigration policies. I am in favour of it, but I am also in favour of an immigration policy which is better suited to the needs of the labour market, because otherwise, Minister, this lack of suitability will lead to irregular contracts, or rather a lack of contracts, and I believe that this is the worst of the ‘<span class="italic">lamada</span>’ effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in line with the working plan proposed by the Commission and which the Council should adopt, I would like to ask the following four questions: What does the Council think of Mr Prodi’s proposal with regard to border police? What does the Council think about the Green Paper on repatriation? Can you give us a timetable for the implementation of the Tampere proposals? What does the Council think of their content given the way they have been presented by the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the timeliness of this debate is beyond dispute. The recent rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in France and the Netherlands shows what happens when governments fail to respond to the challenge of immigration. We know that, quite apart from the valuable contribution which immigrants bring to our societies in terms of increased cultural diversity, there are sound economic reasons for a policy of managed immigration, such as meeting labour shortages and funding our creaking pension systems. Indeed, our prosperity will depend on immigration. The question therefore is: what policy should we adopt to make immigration politically acceptable?</p>
<p class="contents">What we must not do, as too many socialist governments have done, is to bury our heads in the sand and refuse to address the challenge. It is in large part the failure of EU governments to police our borders, to tackle discrimination and xenophobia, and to integrate immigrants harmoniously into our societies that has led to this impasse. No wonder public concern continues to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Democrat approach would be to open the front door a little, by providing legal avenues for immigration, in order better to close the back door to illegal immigration. This approach has been successfully pioneered by the Canadian Government, and is reflected in the European Commission's proposals for a common immigration policy. It is one we would do well to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of managed legal immigration, co-ordinated among Member States, does not mean a free-for-all. Incentives to immigrants to settle more evenly across their host countries would help. A policy which balances rights and duties, so that those newly arriving understand that they can work in their host country and enjoy free movement in the Union and other benefits of EU citizenship, would be helpful too. But they must also understand the need to make an effort to integrate and to live by the rules of the society they join. It is nonsensical political correctness to dismiss any requirement that immigrants should learn the language of their host country. Moreover, proper support for integration must be provided and we must combat discrimination and racism wherever it is found. In this regard, I would pay tribute to the work of the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and I commend to political parties the Charter of Political Parties for a non-racist society.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to invest more in our justice systems and the enforcement of legal judgments – we can only expect immigrants to respect core values if we too ensure that these values are respected fully by existing society.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of managed immigration requires tough action to control the Union's external borders and I therefore congratulate the Commission for its initiative on a common border guard corps. We also need to do more to help the poor and dispossessed, as the Commissioner said, in their countries of origin, so that they do not have to resort in desperation to criminal gangs of people-smugglers. Most people do not want to up sticks and move elsewhere, so helping to relieve the pressure of illegal immigration is yet another argument, if one were needed, for promoting global free trade and making progress towards the UN target of 0.7% of GDP for development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as asylum policy is concerned, here again the Liberal Democrat Group is broadly supportive of the Commission's proposals and often sceptical of actions proposed in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we believe that there is both a moral and an economic case for managed immigration and a humanitarian approach to asylum. We in the ELDR Group will support the Commission in its efforts to move the Union towards the common policies foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty. For in the words of that great Liberal J.K. Galbraith: "Migration is the oldest action against poverty. What is the perversity in the human soul that causes people to resist so obvious a good?".</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I agree with much of what Mr Watson has just said, even if I do not share his belief in the power of free trade to help solve these ills. I welcome some of the statements this afternoon and particularly the attendance of Commissioner Patten. For too long, we have seen these issues purely as a question of law and order, rather than international and economic relations. Migration is a development issue, as the Swedish government has demonstrated by the way in which it organises its ministries.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is fine with the idea of a common asylum and a common immigration policy if it is going to be of a higher standard than that which we currently have. I have yet to be convinced that this is going to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a lot this afternoon about the need to control borders, but maybe not quite so much about why people are so desperate to cross them. For some, it is a freely made choice – that is as it should be, and part of what it is we are trying to create with the idea of free movement within the European Union. Others, of course, come through force of circumstance because they see no future and no economic possibilities for themselves. We have to remember that the remittances from such people often outweigh the aid which our governments give.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union also has a duty to examine its own policies, to see where these act as factors which actually encourage people to feel forced to migrate. It is a good time to examine this in the run-up to the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. We need to look at sustainable development and the way in which we give economic possibilities to all.</p>
<p class="contents">I was recently amazed to meet somebody from a Romanian embassy, who told me that the environmental clear-up for her country was important, but would have to be done after they had seen to the security of their borders because those were the priorities they were faced with. The other issue which we really need to look at is how we create an immigration policy – allowing people of all skill levels to enter, which is what business tells us we need – as well as looking at legal routes to asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I previously understood that, in Mr Watson’s view, this was due to an unwillingness to tackle this evil at root. I believe, however, that we need to be alert to another aspect of the matter, namely to the fact that the xenophobic parties – for example, in my own country – are strongest where there are fewest foreigners and weakest in those areas where there are most foreigners. I believe we must also see xenophobia as a symptom of other things, namely the fact that fear in itself is often more powerful than the object of fear and the fact that the background to a great deal of all this is a powerlessness that stems from social exclusion, which is also a consequence of increased competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we began the debate in this House, I had just visited the UNHCR's web site to see what the situation was, and, unfortunately, it had not of course changed for the better. There are still more than 21 million refugees who, as such, come under the responsibility of the UNHCR, and there is a corresponding number of internally displaced people who are refugees within their own countries. That of course says something about the enormous need there is for action to be taken. We also need to devise a common policy and to take measures jointly. It would be useful however if, before we begin, we were to agree upon what heading we were to act under. Is the aim to reduce the number of refugees for whom the UNHCR, with its scarce resources, is responsible, or is it to reduce the number of refugees who reach, or pass through, the gates of the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Spanish Presidency for its report, because things are of course happening along the way. Matters are proceeding slowly and, in my view, too slowly where a number of the issues are concerned. It is not completely clear, however, under what heading the work is being done. Unfortunately, I have to say that the heading under which the Danish Presidency will be acting when it takes over shortly is crystal clear. The Danish Minister for Europe states very clearly that the purpose of a common policy for the EU is to stem the tide. There is, of course, a logic here, and the desire for tighter control, increased border surveillance, more of Eurodac and more of Dublin makes sense in this context. None of these measures make sense, however, if all that is relevant is the second project, aimed at reducing the total overall number of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can be in favour of the Mafia’s earning money from human trafficking, and no one can be in favour of an activity that results in the death of innocent Chinese in Dover or anywhere else, for that was not of course a unique event. Bodies are washed up on the coasts of Europe every day as a result of completely unscrupulous Mafia methods. When, however, we ourselves are involved in criminalising anyone who helps refugees and when we also criminalise those acting from good, heartfelt Christian or other religious motives or for humanitarian reasons, then we are directly implicated in supporting the Mafia in this project of theirs. When we do that, we are cramming poor people’s money directly into the pockets of the Mafia. When our response to the 21 million refugees is higher walls around ourselves, then we are stuffing poor people’s money into the pockets of those who should have enough money as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to combine our efforts, but we cannot shut out the surrounding world, no matter how high the walls we build. We are therefore concerned here with the sharing of responsibility, more aid for crisis prevention, improved aid to developing countries – and, on that issue, I should be very interested to know if the Danish Liberals support the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party – more support for the UNHCR's work and greater courage on the part of European politicians in resisting populism and xenophobia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The case of the 13 Palestinians released from the Church of the Nativity and the Italian Government’s proposal to treat the solution of transferring them to Europe as a European matter is evidence, at last, of the intention to give the Union a role in issues which have hitherto been left to the Member States to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to deny that a biblical exodus towards the Union countries is taking place. What might have seemed scenes from dramatic films until a few years ago are now images we see daily in the media: ramshackle old lighters, disused barges, sailing boats from the time of Sandokan the pirate and overflowing dinghies bring hundreds upon hundreds of despairing people to our shores who have often spent copious amounts of money to get that far and are subjected to days and days of deprivation and hardship. Many of them, men, women and children, die during the journey or are thrown into the sea by their captains, as happened along the coasts of Sicily and Puglia. And we are still wondering whether there is a need for legislation preventing illegal immigration. Without rules there is no freedom, and without freedom there is no progress and no dignity of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is behind schedule in its implementation of the third pillar and it has thus far proved incapable of adopting a single political and legislative position, nor can it hide behind the Convention in the hope that it will be able to find quick solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems there are, and we are quite aware of and support the efforts being made by the Spanish Presidency. A European corps of border police must be created as soon as possible, working cooperatively on land and at sea; it is right for there to be a database for entry visas but it is also right that every country should have a responsibility to identify all the people who do not cross its borders legally or who are not in possession of valid identity documents, using digital fingerprinting, amongst other techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">We must distinguish between the regular immigrants who have been living in our countries for years and those who enter them illegally, often without a real excuse, who are serving, sometimes even unwittingly, the purposes of certain criminal groups. Moreover, we must address the situation resolutely and take political action against those countries which are guilty of allowing immigration to continue as well as those countries in which there is a type of political system which places the lives and physical health of their citizens in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must review its trade agreements with countries which fail to respect human dignity. We must all take up arms daily in a relentless political battle against international criminal groups – which raise funds by trafficking human beings.</p>

If that question were to be encountered with no preparation other than sincere humanitarian sentiment, it might be naively imagined that political efforts should be aimed at deterring and preventing the persecution and political oppression that give rise to the asylum problem, as well as at distributing both wealth and political influence or, in short, democratising the prosperity of the world which is at present concentrated in a few dominant centres, including the EU, that function as oases in a world of social, economic and political misery. That, however, is not the Council’s perspective. On the contrary, because development of the EU’s political and economic power – which necessarily takes place at the expense of the surrounding world – always is, always has been and always will be, politically speaking, the overarching guiding principle of the European Union’s policy. Nor do the perspective and the progress talked of by the Council consist of making every possible effort on behalf of asylum seekers and immigrants. It is not the interests of foreign immigrants, including those of our fellow human beings in distress, that we primarily have in mind. No, the concepts of making progress and adopting perspectives have far more limited meanings. The idea is that immigration policy should be of the greatest possible benefit to ourselves. It is a question of restricting the right of asylum as far as possible, as is stated in the phrase ‘stem the tide of refugees’. It is about using our repressive systems to take measures against something called illegal immigration. This takes place in conjunction with a particularly well-developed legal imagination and by means of surveillance, fingerprinting, the Eurodac regulation, the free exchange of personal information and other measures bordering on the methods used by police states. In short, we are concerned here with developing and consolidating Fortress Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ironically, all these measures are described as progress. With cruel humour, we even bid these foreigners welcome in what we describe as an area of freedom, security and justice. As a Danish citizen, I am ashamed to have to acknowledge that my country is a pioneer of this whole short-sighted, callous and xenophobic immigration policy. Not only has Danish policy, which in actual fact prevents asylum seekers from being able to exercise their right of asylum, infected the other Member States. Right now, the Danish parliament is also debating a draft law which is striking in the way it clamps down on, for example, asylum procedure so that this can best be characterised as ‘administrative harassment’. What is more, this is being done in cooperation with the xenophobic right-wing Danish People’s Party. I have to admit that the prospects for further so-called progress under the Danish Presidency are frightening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can therefore say that Pim Fortuyn’s sacrifice may not have been in vain. I should like to say that if, as he says, ‘Holland is full’, so is Italy, so is Padania, so is Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposals put forward, well then, the Spanish Presidency is talking about the creation of a European corps of border police, which no one could oppose, but it must be a corps equipped with adequate resources, the necessary rules and instruments to make its action effective. Digital fingerprinting is only the minimum requirement: of course, we need the necessary connections and the necessary cooperation to be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of cooperation, I would like to further stress the responsibilities of a State such as Turkey: it is unthinkable that the famous <span class="italic">carrette del mare</span> (unseaworthy old tubs) which have already been mentioned should continue to set off from the harbours of that country, bearing hundreds if not thousands of illegal migrants carrying weapons and drugs to the southern coasts of Italy, for example, setting them down in the south so that they can spread up the country to Padania. Now, I feel that we should make very specific demands on that country, which is hoping to enter the European Union; we must demand very specific undertakings to genuinely block the activities of the mafioso groups involved in the international trafficking of migrants.</p>

Networks of smugglers are making billions out of illegal immigrants and, at elections, the public shows its displeasure at EU immigration policy being far from ideally organised. We need Europe-wide strategies on immigration and asylum, and so I am pleased by the Spanish offensive, which I emphatically support.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expectation must be that speedy and reliable asylum procedures be rapidly implemented, in accordance with our decisions, that we decide on strategies for the deportation illegal immigrants and of those whose applications for asylum have been rejected, and that we make rules for the lawful economic migration of labour, which must be what the Member States require, and within the limits of their capacities and needs. I welcome the way in which decisive steps are being taken to combat illegal immigration, whether by the introduction of the ‘Eurodac’ system or by joint patrols of the external borders by a Eurocorps, doing the best job possible with the aid of satellites and radar. In addition, though, we do of course need help on the spot, in other words, measures to create stability and provide help in the countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must firmly reject, however, is what assails our ears from Europe's left. At national level, arguments that we neither want nor need are served up in beer halls, whilst, at the European level, the left-wing clientele is kept happy with demands that the public neither understands nor supports, such as, recently, for all applicants for asylum to have access to the labour market from day one on and to have freedom of movement right across the European Union, even though only 10% of them can acquire refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank God the Council and the Commission are supporting us, the Group of the European People's Party, in taking this sensible line on immigration and asylum policy. You on the Left – your policy is not accepted. Not only is it not accepted; if it is proceeded with, it will incite more Le Pens. That is something we do not want! That is something we do not need! So I rejoice at the Spanish Presidency's commitment and support Commissioner Vitorino's initiatives.</p>

I am afraid to say that the result is neither positive nor encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing the Tampere conclusions, the Commission has indicated through a legislative programme the need to develop a proactive policy which recognises that the pressure from migration is going to continue and that ordered migration can bring benefits for Europe, for the migrants themselves and for their countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach proposed by the Commission involves a comprehensive policy which addresses all the issues – economic, social, political and humanitarian – and provides for close cooperation between government actions and initiatives of the social partners, the associations and local and regional authorities. As we know and as you, President-in-Office, have pointed out, all this means working on five policies simultaneously: defining legal immigration channels, combating illegal immigration, equal treatment in line with the principles of non-discrimination against non-Community citizens and with integration policies, partnership with the countries of origin, and the establishment of a European asylum system. Despite this positive line taken by the Commission and the incorporation of Parliament’s contributions, our progress is neither positive nor encouraging. I feel that the Council is largely responsible for all this for, on the one hand, it is laying down a path to follow – as it did, indeed, at Tampere – and, on the other, it has constantly failed to fulfil its undertakings or to shoulder its ensuing responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and many governments are overlooking the fact that one of the causes of immigration is precisely our own labour shortage. We have to admit that we have failed to identify the needs of our labour market or to see the need to combat illegal working, to see the link between these concerns<span class="bold"> </span>and an effective immigration policy. We focus purely on security issues which, although important, need to be addressed in a balanced way with a policy based on respect for the law and the rights of individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards security and immigration, however, some of the governments in Europe, such as the Italian Government, tend to practise a combination of alarmism and utopianism. Immigration is seen solely as a threat against which the country must defend itself, people’s fears are fed and it is promised that the problem will miraculously disappear; populist slogans imply that the State and the police are justified in anything they do to secure order.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposite is true, however. A responsible security policy must be based on two, interconnected pillars: firstly, holding the doors open to the flows of legal immigration, with precise rules and limits, and I do mean holding the doors open, not flinging them wide. The other pillar is an effective fight against illegal immigration. Failure to do the former will mean having to step up the latter, however, for the most desperate people, those determined – or forced – to emigrate, throw themselves into the arms of the criminal traffickers offering to take them to Europe in their floating death traps.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that the citizens’ concerns cannot, indeed must not be ignored, it is also true that these concerns cannot be addressed, much less resolved, through alarmism or blind, repressive policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It represented a mutually beneficial relationship between immigrant and host country. Then it became aid immigration, characterised by a period of compromise and uncertainty. Finally, in the past few years, it has really become human trafficking: clandestine workers, prostitutes and slaves, as we see in their hundreds in the streets of all our capital cities. This situation, where we are seeing both immigrants and host countries fall victim to uncontrolled immigration, is of course unacceptable. It is the result of thirty years of naïve optimism on the part of the European left, whose good intentions are equalled only by the disastrous results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly a good thing that we are discussing the matter here, but allow me, in conclusion, to say that we must handle this with the greatest care. We cannot decide for people who will bear their family name or who will be their next-door neighbour. These things are of paramount importance and, if you go too far and take the risk of killing off the nations, you will also, and perhaps you will pay more attention to this, be taking the risk of killing off Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that it is perplexing that at its recent meeting in Seville the European Socialist Group should have accused the Spanish Presidency and the People’s Party of having a frivolous attitude to immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">What is frivolous is for the Socialist Group to say one thing here in Parliament and then do something else in the Council by means of its governments; it is also frivolous to approve reports in the European Parliament which promote illegal immigration and offer asylum seekers rights which not even Community citizens have, such as the recognition of the right and obligation for them to be guaranteed nurseries for their children.</p>
<p class="contents">The incoherences of the Socialist Group and its complete lack of ideas and sensible proposals is therefore alarming. This is what leads to extremist tendencies in Europe – although they will not want to hear this today – such as that of Mr Le Pen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the association agreements with third countries are there for a reason, but some of these countries only see them as a source of funding and do not apply those parts which relate to cooperation and dialogue in such important areas as their taking responsibility for regulating migratory flows from their territories. And Morocco is a clear example, as demonstrated by what is happening on its borders with Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no mistake: if the countries from which immigration originates do not put their house in order, the problem will continue. I believe we shall have to start thinking about making serious demands within the framework of the commitments made within agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our external borders are not closed to those who wish to cooperate in our development in a legal and regulated fashion or those who want to live together on the basis of respect, which must be mutual, for the customs, cultures, security and liberty of those of us who live in the geographical and political area of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">Although I should not make comments of a personal nature, the first comment I am going to make is personal, but I am making it because I believe that most of my colleagues in the Council agree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no doubt that immigration has been and still is the most important phenomenon to affect the European Union and will remain so over the coming years. It is a phenomenon which will cause much greater changes than the very creation of the EU and the progress we have seen during its construction. It is therefore an issue on which we must work with the necessary skill, sufficient balance and wisdom in terms of what is said and – and this is much more important – what is done.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must work to bring the positions of all the Member States closer together in this field, since, amongst other things, we are now, at the very least, an area of free movement of persons, goods etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The ideas I believe we have been working on in recent times are the following: firstly, Europe can be – in fact it is, has been and can continue to be in the future – a reception country, because people can without doubt earn a good living here and because furthermore – let us not deceive ourselves – there is a great amount of activity by many people which contributes to the economic growth of our countries. However – and this is the second idea I wanted to express here – immigration must take place legally and we must state clearly that it can not be infinite, because, amongst other things, infinite immigration creates infinite marginalisation. In this respect, we must make an effort to act as responsibly as possible. Thirdly, we must make an effort to integrate people who live outside the European Union with those who live inside. That integration effort must be made by the public administrations of the countries of the Union and also their societies, but we must also demand that all those people who come from outside accept the basic rules of co-existence which we have in the countries of the European Union, which are our Constitutions, our principles and our values, because this affects all of us. There is no doubt that immigrants have rights, but they also have obligations, just as the nationals of the countries of the European Union have. The fourth idea is that we have to fight hard against illegal immigration. We must do this by improving our police systems, visas and border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the action plan against illegal immigration is a good route and that it should lead to many rules which in the future will make us more efficient, but I would also like to point out, as I said at the beginning of my intervention – and this is an aspect which I would like to emphasise in particular – that we must turn the immigration policy into a fundamental element of the European Union’s foreign policy, which – I believe – makes absolute sense if we accept, as I believe we are almost all accepting today, that immigration is the most important phenomenon of our times.</p>
<p class="contents">Those were my initial comments. Now I would also like to clarify some of the issues raised here by various speakers: it has been said that little progress has been made, even that no progress has been made, under the Spanish Presidency. I believe that in my first speech I summarised what the Spanish Presidency has done in relation to immigration during these six months. Obviously everyone can interpret this as they see fit, and by being subjective one can become extremely anti-objective, but, in any event, in case it is of any use to those who hold this view, I would suggest that they make a comparison with what has happened in the past: we should remember that the area of security, justice and freedom, was born in practice in Amsterdam, that it entered into force in 1999 and that a very important dimension of the Union, the economic dimension, has existed for many years, but that almost fifty years passed before we had the euro and even now many Member States, as is their legitimate right, still do not have it. Therefore, we should not be pessimistic when it comes to progress and neither should we look after number one, because that will do no good, nor bring in any votes, and furthermore I imagine that that is not the intention here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to make a comment with regard to some speakers’ insistence that we have put the emphasis on the fight against illegal immigration and not on other issues. Well, it is true that we have put the emphasis on illegal immigration, because it is an important issue, because there was a strong Laeken mandate and a Commission communication and, above all, because everybody wanted it, but we have also put the emphasis on active policies, such as integration policies and the promotion of legality.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about the general approach in the Council with regard to the proposed directive on the reception of asylum seekers. The action plan for combating illegal immigration contains very important preventive measures. We have initiated a series of dialogues with countries of origin and transit; including Asian countries. We have made progress with directives relating to illegal immigration which contain integration measures and we have made progress with the Union’s own action plans; I do not therefore think that statements of this type are justified.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to certain concrete issues raised – and this will form the fourth section of my speech – I would say the following: in relation to the directive on conditions for asylum seekers, it is true that a general approach was achieved in the Council on the same day that Parliament issued its opinion, but we are now going to work as Fifteen and we are going to take account of the suggestions made by this Parliament, as we always have.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European police – another of the issues raised – we will present a viability study on the 30 May in Rome. This study is headed by the Italian Government with the cooperation of three or four other EU countries, including Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Green Paper, I believe it is adequate and that we should make progress on European repatriation policies. I believe that we would be making a great error if, in order to combat illegal immigration, we did not make an effort to cooperate with the countries from which the immigrants originate. It is true that this effort must be accompanied by cooperation policies. That is why I said that it was essential that immigration policy be treated as a key policy within our foreign policy. But how can we fail to be in favour of the Green Paper proposed by the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to certain comments that have been made on racism and xenophobia, I would like to say that at the last meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in April, following a communication from various countries of the European Union and of the current Presidency, we have approved a declaration against racism and xenophobia. The truth is that declarations against racism and xenophobia can be adopted – and they must be adopted because luckily we live in one of the most civilised regions, which are most respectful of the rights and freedoms of all the people of the world – but that that approval is perfectly compatible with compliance with the law and the fight against illegal actions which, in the field of immigration, are taking place every day.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the Council’s position on this issue. These are the approaches we are working on and on which we are going to work until the end. I am grateful for the Commission’s words and efforts, which without doubt govern all the actions of the Council and I am also grateful for the suggestions, comments, opinions and criticisms the Members have expressed here and I thank the President for her patience in allowing me to speak for longer than I should.</p>
