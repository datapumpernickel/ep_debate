<p class="contents">This is why I am here today to present to you a strategy for European action. The starting point for this strategy is to meet the expectations and needs of Europe’s citizens and its aim is to ensure that by 2010 Europe will be well on the way towards renewal. I should like to propose to you that Parliament should also make this its strategy. The Constitution provides for a common action programme that must be agreed upon by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I suggest that we take our lead from this provision straightaway, and propose to Parliament and the Council that the strategic objectives for the Union adopted by the Commission today act as a basis for joint action in the next five years. This is a partnership for a renewed Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Union need a partnership? Enlargement has demonstrated that Europe is a success, but the truth of the matter is that many citizens still appear to have doubts. Together we must strengthen our legitimacy; together we must send out a stronger message; together we must show our political determination to strive to achieve common goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is our first task in a partnership for a renewed Europe. Such a partnership is the only way for us to tackle the complex challenges ahead. Dreams are of no use if we do not map out how we can turn them into reality. It is high time to release Europe’s enormous untapped potential. Vision, leadership and delivery: these are the things that should steer us in the direction of renewed trust and confidence. However, partnership cannot be confined to the Brussels beltway.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial aspect of the partnership will be to bring it to our citizens. We cannot ignore the concerns expressed by citizens when it comes to Europe. Are we interfering too much, or are we being too timid in our initiatives? Are we too technocratic? Are we too cut off from reality? Do we live up to our promises? Our first responsibility is therefore to reconnect with the citizens. How can we do this? Let me give some examples. The successful entry into force of the Constitution is a first step. Legislation should be simpler and more coherent, making full use of the Community method, and effectively implemented. The budget will provide the European Union with the means to meet its commitments. Broader civic participation is required in the European project. Communication, transparency and consultation are needed if we are to engage with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The partnership I have described is a means to an end. We propose that the partnership work towards a European renewal. Why a renewal? If one looks at the direction in which the European project is heading, the challenges ahead may be familiar, but they call for new ideas, renewed energy, fresh determination and a sense of optimism. We need to translate words into action, and that is the purpose of our proposals today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission also adopted today its legislative and work programme for 2005. This is the first practical demonstration of the partnership that the Commission is proposing to you. This programme translates the key elements – the five-year strategy – into actions for this year. This is the new Commission’s starting point for action. For a number of reasons, the programme is innovative and realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this is a programme that is focused on the main political objectives that the Commission is proposing to meet by the end of its term in office. The programme also constitutes the first step in the implementation of strategic objectives. I should like, if I may, to illustrate my proposal by mentioning certain key steps. The Commission is committed to a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy, and will submit the proposals that are still needed so that the proposed package on the future financial perspectives can be completed. Major effort will also be needed in order to implement the Hague programme aimed at driving forward the area of freedom, security and justice. A fresh social agenda will be put forward to promote the social dimension of economic progress. In order for these steps actually to be taken, we are tabling a list of priority initiatives that the Commission intends to adopt by the end of the year. These initiatives will be submitted for an impact assessment in order to ensure that the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and added value to the Union are properly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to improve the flow of information between the Commission and Parliament and to improve the legislative process, I can announce to you that we shall be providing monthly estimates on the legislative proposals being drawn up, and those estimates will be regularly updated.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in keeping with the spirit of the proposed partnership, the Commission is looking to improve the implementation of its work programme, and in order to do this, it is seeking to work more closely with Parliament. Accordingly, the team of Commissioners, and in particular Vice-President Wallström, plans to set up permanent dialogue on such matters with you.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this programme is the first stage in the partnership for European renewal that the Commission is proposing to you today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must not only work on our immediate priorities, but also map out a vision for the future. The proposal for the strategic objectives adopted by the Commission this morning is based on three fundamental objectives: prosperity, solidarity, security. Each of these objectives also has a link with the world around us. That is why a stronger voice in the world is a necessary corollary.</p>
<p class="contents">Our number one priority is prosperity. It is the cornerstone on which the European model of social solidarity and sustainability is built. Prosperity requires economic growth, competitiveness and productivity. These are the conditions for nurturing sustainable development. Indeed, the Constitution lays down sustainable development as the framework for <span class="italic">all</span> European Union policies. This must underlie all our work, and lasting prosperity is only possible in a climate of solidarity and security.</p>
<p class="contents">With these permanent objectives in mind, we now need to focus on the instruments, and there we come to the economy. In the present context of declining growth, and considering the challenges from global competition, our first task must be to help restore growth, pursue the necessary reforms and create more and better jobs. So how do we put Europe back on the path to long-term prosperity? The answer is clear: we need a new economic dynamism. Next week I will come before you with our proposal for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. The Kok Report has already identified where the strategy needs new energy, in particular to remedy inadequate implementation and lack of ownership.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the main conclusions are clear. Growth needs to be based on sound macro-economic foundations. The legal framework must foster entrepreneurship – think about the small- and medium-sized enterprises and the jobs they can create. Growth cannot come without investment in the knowledge economy, indeed knowledge for growth is a priority in the review of the Lisbon Strategy. Finally, we should draw people into more and better jobs. Renewed growth and more and better jobs will only come when we translate our analysis into action, and that must be our task for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Another strategic objective is solidarity. There is no Union without solidarity. Our common project implies a responsibility to guarantee social justice, but also to protect our environment. This means renewed action in different areas. There must be economic solidarity. Cohesion policy must remain at the heart of how the Union works. We must narrow disparities between the rich and the poor in Europe and help disadvantaged areas and groups.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be social solidarity through a revised social agenda. Future generations will not forgive us if we fail to tackle climate change and cherish our natural resources. There is also the problem of solidarity among generations. We need to act. It is possible to preserve Europe’s prosperity and quality of life. Environmental protection can be turned into a double advantage by fully exploiting Europe’s competitive edge in environmental technology and promoting eco-efficiency efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity also means the promotion and defence of European common values. When we speak about a soul for Europe we mean values such as guaranteeing fundamental rights, fighting against discrimination, promoting gender equality, and protecting and promoting cultural diversity. These are the foundations of a society based on mutual understanding and dignity. This message is all the more relevant as we prepare to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to prosperity and solidarity, there is another strategic objective: security. Only with security can we enjoy the benefits of liberty. Within a borderless Europe, citizens increasingly look to the European Union to find solutions to tackle the risks they face in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">For freedom, justice and security, the Hague Programme has given us a roadmap to move ahead, but we need to bring this work to fruition. Prevention and the fight against crime and terrorism must remain a top priority for the coming years. At the same time, the freedom and fundamental rights cherished by Europeans should be respected. The efficient control and surveillance of external frontiers is a common duty for Member States and the Commission. The Union provides a framework for effectively managing asylum, immigration and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are other security concerns which affect our citizens’ daily lives. Natural disasters, environmental or health crises, transport and energy threats have a direct impact on citizens’ security and wellbeing. The Union has a role to play both in reducing risks and in offering a rapid response. The action in the wake of the tsunami disaster was just the latest example of what the Union can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must admit that Europe cannot achieve these objectives in isolation. Since the Union is a global partner, our number one priority – prosperity – is intimately linked to relations with our partners. The solidarity we seek for our citizens cannot stop at the borders of the Union. It is an illusion to believe that Europe can be an island of peace with no other choice than either exporting stability or importing instability. The borderline between our internal and external policies is gradually vanishing. </p>
<p class="contents">During the next five years there is one external priority for which we should assume a particular responsibility. I refer to the coming accession negotiations and the need to work for a stable and prosperous neighbourhood as an essential instrument for our security policy and for the reaffirmation of our democratic values. More broadly, our partnership should also entail a message of renewal for our action in the rest of the world around us. Europe should speak with a stronger, single voice in order to promote effective multilateralism and a stronger role for the United Nations. The relations with our key partners should be reinvigorated. A new strategy for Africa is indispensable if we want to prevent parts of this continent that is so close to us from declining any further. We should also inject fresh blood into our transatlantic relationship, looking forward to our common interests for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have presented the general outline of the strategic objectives we propose to share with you in the framework of the partnership for European renewal that should guide our action for the next five years. However, setting objectives is not enough: we can only turn our ambitions into reality if the Union has the necessary means to do so – I am referring to the financial perspectives for the period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not telling you anything new when I say that last year’s Commission proposals were no surprise – they are the counterpart of our ambitions. All the Commission is asking is to endow the Union with the financial translation of the commitments made at various European summits over the years. I repeat what I have said on other occasions: one cannot have more Europe with less money.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have come to a point where I hear proposals to reduce the Union’s budget even to a level below that of 2006. I ask you whether this is feasible or realistic. The Commission will do its best to play a constructive role, with the support of this House, in order to strive for an agreement on the financial perspectives in the coming months. Let me say, however, loud and clear that this agreement cannot come at any price. This is a duty we have to all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">This College and its President have been elected by a broad majority in this House. As we put our proposals in front of you today, we want to honour the confidence you have expressed in us. We have listened to Parliament’s views and we are ready to stand the test. We believe that what we propose to you is good for Europe and for all Europeans. We hope you can agree with us that we can work together on the common strategic objectives. Growth and jobs, a dynamic, competitive economy, and modernised social protection and solidarity are the key to our model of social justice and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">At home and in the world around us this is what we propose to you today, and we hope we can count on your support.</p>

I feel that the President of the Commission was wise to confine himself to the substance, and not to go into too much detail on the legislation that must be put in place or the initiatives that must be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to see that the opinions of the Commission and the Presidency broadly coincide and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the programmes of the Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies, and of those that follow in 2006, are in fact very close to the Commission President’s proposals. I feel that this is a partnership for European renewal on which there should not be any interinstitutional conflict. The people watching us – the citizens of Europe – are not interested in the opinions and the actions of the Commission, the Council and Parliament. For Europeans, Europe is one entity.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that there have been differing reactions to my proposals, and that some of those reactions have given me more pleasure than others!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Given the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Council, I would suggest that we look into ways of showing the outside world that the three institutions are indeed in broad agreement, and, even if the new Constitution is not yet in force, we shall certainly find ways and means of raising awareness of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to inform you that the chairman of the General Affairs Council, Mr Asselborn, will ensure that the speech by the President of the Commission and the programme that he has drawn up will feature on the agenda at the General Affairs Council of 31 January. Together with the other two institutions, we shall try to find a way to express this shared desire.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the European Council, ladies and gentlemen, the presence of the President of the European Council in this chamber today – for the first time in the history of the European Union – is splendidly symbolic, and augurs well for the success of the Commission’s work in the coming five years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fine symbol: here we are today, the President of the Commission, the President of the European Council and the Members of this European Parliament, taking counsel together on the future of our European continent and setting out on the road together, for we know that European integration is the greatest labour of peace of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and it is one for which we want to work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our values, our ideals and our convictions that guide us in what we do. We have faith in our European continent; we believe that it has a future in which we and our children can share. Faith alone, though, is not enough; our common task is to make that faith real through our actions. Our values, which underpin what we do, are the dignity of man, the rule of law, democracy, and an order which, while founded upon the market economy, is also social.</p>
<p class="contents">We have confidence in people, in their abilities, and in their drive. Neither state nor public intervention can be fundamental; it is the initiative of each individual, the realisation of their own potential in a society characterised by both freedom and solidarity, that is our model for the future of this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you have chosen a fine motto for your programme – a partnership within and without, and prosperity, solidarity and security to renew Europe. Your programme is both realistic and ambitious, and we are glad that, rather than again having recourse to the overblown language of Lisbon in March 2000, when the talk was of how Europe was going to become the most competitive economic location in the world, you talk of it becoming ‘more competitive’. You are modest in the language you use, but ambitious in the goal you set, and I see that as the right formula for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of the European social model is dependent on the European Union’s ability to compete in the world, and those who fail to promote the European Union’s competitiveness now will bear the blame if, in the future, we are unable to guarantee a European social model. The European Union’s competitiveness and the European social model are two sides of the same coin, and we are also facing the enormous challenge posed by changes in population. Another great political task for Europe and the countries in it will be to establish the conditions for a proper family policy, for children’s future. Without children, this continent has no future, and that is why we have to treat this as such a major issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, if we become more competitive, this does not end up benefiting businesses in some abstract way; in very practical ways, it benefits workers, for it is not just about retaining jobs, but also about using our increasing competitiveness as a means to create more of them. That is why there is no contradiction between competition on the one hand and social policy on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Almunia’s presence here reminds me that the President of the European Council also, at the same time, presides over an important group of finance ministers. Our group is committed to keeping Europe’s currency stable, and nothing of what we have hitherto heard from Mr Juncker gives us cause for concern. What is crucial, though, is that the assessment of financial policy – and that includes the financial policies of the Member States – should remain the Commission’s responsibility and that the decision as to whether to go back to running a deficit should not be left to the Member States alone; the Commission has an important part to play in it. If you follow the example of your predecessor Pedro Solbes, Mr Almunia, you will always have support from us.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal and external security – that too was something you mentioned, Mr President of the Commission. People expect our borders to be secure: we have 11 000 kilometres of them on land, and 68 000 kilometres at sea, and we have to secure them, but they must not become impenetrable. We cannot, in future, have even more people from the states on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa trying to escape the misery of their home countries and dying at sea in the attempt; this is where we have to make a joint effort, together with our neighbours in North Africa, to find a good and humane solution to the refugee problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true, but in another way, of our Eastern neighbours. Tomorrow, Viktor Yushchenko, the newly-elected President of Ukraine, will be here with us. Whilst it would not be true to say that all countries with policies along European lines are capable of joining the European Union right away, what is crucial is that we develop a policy of being a good neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to say that in matters of security, armed force can never be more than the means of last resort. Our task as Europeans is to put together a policy of preventive security. I urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to make every effort to bring peace to the Middle East, enabling Israel to live in peace and the Palestinians to retain their dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is in this way that we go into the future of the European Union, and if the Financial Perspective does nothing to infringe Parliament’s rights, then we will be right alongside you, Mr President of the Commission. We have confidence in you, and, for the sake of our European continent, we wish you great success.</p>

That such a President of the Commission as Mr Barroso has not presented us with a glass brimming over with red wine is something we expected. Now, though, we have to ask ourselves whether the glass is half full or half empty. We have come to the conclusion that it is half full.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals you have put before us are good; some of them are what we Social Democrats expected from a Commission such as yours. There are also things that you omitted, and that we would have liked to hear from you, but I do not want to hold that against you. Much of what we have heard today we can see as reflecting what we Social Democrats think.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I want to thank you for having worked with the Social Democrats among your Commissioners, and it is evident even from the title of your strategic programme that you discussed its publication with Commissioner Wallström. That is apparent both from the title and the contents, which reflects points that we Social Democrats have made, and that, Mr President, is a good thing. We would encourage you to carry on down that road.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard you say that you want your work over the next five years to focus on prosperity, solidarity and security. You have proved yourself to be a good listener. You were right to say that solidarity, prosperity and security are interdependent. Now, within the European framework, each has his responsibility: you, the President of the Council, and this Parliament as a whole. All of us have our institutional roles. This Parliament, though, is home to political families, and the political family that I represent has no institutional role to play, but rather a political task to perform. That political task involves me telling Mr Poettering that he is right to say that enhanced competitiveness and social policy are two sides of the same coin, but that we want both sides of this coin to be stamped with the same value. We are right behind those who want more competition in Europe if they want it to benefit social cohesion. Growth has to be created in order that social cohesion be secured; if that is your watchword, Mr President, then the Socialists are on your side. If, though, that does not happen and the approach involves using deregulation as a means of dismantling the socially responsible practices for which we Socialists have campaigned for over 150 years, then we will not support it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I want to add that we are hearing a good message today. The programme you have put before us is a good one, one on the basis of which we can work together with you. The litmus test, though, will be the lawmaking process. When you take your initiatives and the Council and this House must take joint decisions, we will have to make compromises, and we will then all have to be judged by how much of what had been announced is actually produced. So let me repeat that, while we are prepared to cooperate in a constructive way, we do have our very clearly-defined expectations where the maintenance of social standards in Europe is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things I want to say to you on behalf of the Socialist Group, two things that were new to us today and that we were glad to hear. We have been critical of you – not so much in your present role, which has to do with positions on international policy, as in your former role as Prime Minister of Portugal. For you to say, as you did today, that your Commission wants efficient multilateralism, is something we regard as progress. As Mr Poettering pointed out, we want Europe to be a global political player, but also a civilian power. We do not want to solve international problems with pre-emptive strikes, and I have to say that the re-elected American President’s inauguration speech gave me the impression that the European Union must redouble its efforts at ensuring that civilian rather than military solutions are applied. Let us not add another disaster to the one already playing out in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you, as one of the representatives of an organisation that carries weight in international politics, say: ‘I want efficient multilateralism’, then we will support you in that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Stability Pact, we share Mr Poettering’s view that it must be secured, and believe that its criteria should not be changed, but it must be manageable and usable, addressing the demands of 2005 rather than those of 1990. Fifteen years of development separate those two dates. A Stability Pact that is often interpreted in such a way that it produces the precise opposite of the growth to which its second part refers; a Pact that is so stable that it inhibits growth: such a pact is internally self-contradictory. That is why we want to see it reformed, and that is why we endorse the good proposals from Mr Almunia.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying something fundamental about our future cooperation. This House gained in strength through the whole process of confirming the Commission in office, and it is good that you want to accommodate its wishes and work together with it as a whole. The presence here today of the President of the Council is an outstanding symbol of the truth that, when these institutions work together, security, prosperity, flexibility – and, where necessary, social security – can work. It is in cooperation that we find strength. ‘<span class="italic">L'union fait la force’ </span>is a fine saying. We are willing to unite if we are treated with respect and our political demands taken seriously. Remember, Mr President, that this is a day of agreement, and enjoy it, for the days of trial are yet to come.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ALDE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as Jean Monnet once said ‘each man begins the world afresh and only institutions grow wiser’. President Barroso, you now represent the collective experience of the European Commission. You will have to draw quickly on the collective wisdom of its services and enrich the European experience, in tandem with the European Parliament as a partner in Europe’s growth and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I believe your priorities reflect those of the majority of this House, which believes that we cannot build a house on unstable foundations. If we want a prosperous Europe, a Europe of sustainable development, a Europe that can fight poverty at home and abroad and a Europe able to project its values around the globe, then we must begin by securing a strong and viable economy where businesses and innovation can flourish. If Europe is to have meaning for its citizens, then we have to establish practical and tangible priorities. There is a danger, as we have witnessed with the Lisbon Agenda, that in attempting to do too many things in too many fields we achieve little of substance and leave the European people unable to see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to underpin your objectives with a push for better communication and better information. This should have been done a long time ago. We have allowed the persistent drip of half-truths and myths propagated by nationalists to poison the minds of too many of our fellow citizens. This year of referendums on the Constitution must be a rallying cry to all those who believe in the European project, for this is not about ratifying a text that people have not read, it is about whether Europe’s citizens still believe strongly enough in what the European Union stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">You outline four objectives. First, prosperity. The Lisbon Agenda holds the key to your success, and if you can deliver prosperity and growth through improved competitiveness and knowledge-sharing then we can all partake of the dividends. Liberals and Democrats hope to see improvements to and a more intelligent application of the Stability and Growth Pact that underpins the euro. Ultimately, however, our growth and prosperity also depends on implementation at national level of the key structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, you talked about solidarity – the flip side of the coin. Without that we have no Europe. A prosperous economy is a means to an end, but not an end in itself. European history is anchored in its commitment to solidarity and cohesion, to judicious management of natural resources and respect for common values and cultural diversity. We have to improve both the effectiveness and the accountability of our Structural Funds. Since there are good reasons why we cannot afford to be parsimonious in our future budgetary planning, Liberals and Democrats will fully support a costed and justified budget for the Union for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Security is a matter of common concern, with the tentacles of international terrorism having made themselves felt from Manhattan to Madrid. If we do not find an adequate response to such threats, then the pillars of freedom on which our Union rests will begin to crumble. However, we must not go overboard in attempting to deal with security threats that are often intangible. We need a much wider debate on the balance between security and civic freedoms and I welcome the Commission’s proposals on immigration and asylum, which will be instrumental in steering a discussion based on justice and honesty, rather than pandering to fear and scaremongering.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us have ambitions for the wider world that are based not on imposition by military force but on the projection of soft force – of political dialogue, exchange, economic incentives and sanctions, humanitarian relief and trade agreements. You must deploy all of those tools in a coherent strategy that rewards good governance, punishes tyranny and shows care for the global environment.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, your task is not an easy one. The hopes and futures of Europe’s citizens rest in your hands. I shall end with another quotation from Jean Monnet, who stated in his memoirs that ‘a great statesman is one who can work for long-term goals which eventually suit situations as yet unforeseen’.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, you have set us long-term goals and we trust you will earn the reputation of a great statesman in delivering them.</p>

<p class="contents">It is very difficult, Mr President of the Commission, not to agree with the proposals that you have put forward. I therefore feel that, as things stand, our Group can recommend that you put your plans into action. I should also like to return – and I allude here to a motion for a resolution that we tabled in December jointly with the other political groups – to four or five points relating to political elections, which strike me as significant and which are all in fact already being discussed in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the EU’s budget, to which you alluded. The European Greens feel that the Prodi Commission’s proposal on the Union’s budget ceiling is an absolute minimum, and in fact too low. We therefore support your proposal, Mr Barroso, just as we support the intention to redirect Union expenditure; for example, European funding is to be set up for Natura 2000; in the field of research, funding earmarked for nuclear energy is to be redirected towards renewable energy or towards the Commission’s programme on intelligent energy, a further means of reducing the risks to the public; and European funding for culture and education is to be increased, so that more students and creators can help raise awareness of what is happening in Europe. We certainly support the Commission in its responsibility, which consists of reminding the Council and the Heads of State or Government that, indeed, as you have said, it is not possible for a European Union of 25 Member States and 450 million inhabitants to succeed on the budgets that some governments wish to set aside for it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the REACH legislation, which is genuinely intended to protect human health, while fostering technological innovation in the chemical industry. We hope that the Commission will maintain its proposal so that Parliament can deliver its opinion at first reading and that we do not postpone the entire package once again. Furthermore, the Greens would also like to enrich this proposal with other considerations, such as the obligation to replace very dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the proposed law on the internal services market. As things stand, this will lead to increased competition between economies, without sufficiently regulating the conditions of that competition, thereby paving the way for social dumping in the Union. The country of origin principle cannot be retained as a guiding principle in this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the assessment of Union policy, the Luxembourg Presidency was right, in its Presidency text, to state that assessment of all Union policy regarding the criteria of sustainable development must not be deemed of secondary importance and must not therefore be pushed aside by the Lisbon Strategy. In this regard, we look forward to the Commission’s report on the consistency of policies, such as transport policy or energy policy in respect of the EU’s international commitments within the framework of the climate convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that the Union must continue to play a leading role in international climate negotiations and must immediately undertake to achieve objectives set for 2020 – we are already looking much further ahead – objectives that entail much greater energy-saving efforts than those we are currently making.</p>

I had the opportunity to mention in this very House a Commission report from last January, which pointed out that, on the road to full employment, during the year just finished, for the first time in ten years, we actually shed more jobs than we created. As for building a knowledge-based economy, the same report noted that there had in fact been an ‘overall decline’ in public and private investment in the fields that are key to the future, namely training, education and research. The report also said that more than one 15 year-old in six did not have, and I quote, ‘the minimum skills required, of reading, writing and arithmetic’. This was a shocking, but telling, detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the remedies announced since then, to go faster and further down the neoliberal road, strike us as deeply flawed and extremely dangerous. The key word here is competitiveness. What concept of competitiveness are we talking about? The one prevailing in the Union is based on cutting wages, making labour markets less secure and extending working lives. It generates competition in the social, tax and salary areas between the 25 Member States. It sees the democratic elements of the work code as an obstacle. It drives down public spending and places restrictive limits on the framework of services of general economic interest. Even health and environmental requirements – as has just been said – run the risk of being revised downwards in the name of competitiveness, as in the case of the REACH programme. Cultural exception in the rules of competitiveness is put in jeopardy for the same reason. This is undoubtedly what Mr Barroso was thinking about when he mentioned the ‘friendly business environment’ in the report that he gave us<span class="italic">. </span>I am convinced that this neoliberal mindset, this culture of the lowest bidder, runs counter to the stated objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It thwarts those objectives, first of all, because budgetary and salary austerity contributes towards stagnation in consumption – that crucial engine of growth – and works against jobs; secondly, because this restrictive policy inevitably leads to additional expenditure for men and women, beginning with training, a need that is increasingly crucial; and thirdly because this obsession with the market and the unbridled monetarisation of the economy and of competition, is destroying people’s motivation, creativity and confidence in the future, which is an essential, not to say indispensable, resource in the smooth running of the economy and society. Mr Barroso, you said, yourself, in your communication, that a significant proportion of European public opinion remains to be convinced that Europe is on the right track; that, I believe, is an understatement.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done about this? Among the immediate measures to be taken, as far as we are concerned, is to exclude spending on research, education and health expenditure, spending on certain infrastructures and job-related spending from the assessment of public-sector deficits that are to be brought under control. We must also bring in democratic monitoring of all public funding awarded to companies to check its effectiveness from the point of view of employment, and if that system is shown to be ineffective, money must be paid back.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as Parliament has specifically requested, we feel that an assessment must be made of the effects of liberalisation, such as that of the railways, before moving on to the next stage, and we naturally reiterate our request that the Bolkestein directive be withdrawn. On the subject of that directive, Mr President, I see that it is no longer mentioned in the Commission’s text, unless I am mistaken. I should like to believe that this implies that you have accepted the request for it to be withdrawn, though what we would really like, in view of what is at stake, is for the President of the Commission to confirm this change himself.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, structural changes must, in our view, be put in place that ultimately lead to shared control of the markets and, accordingly, to a return to the primacy of political choice, such as the choice to prioritise job security or training for every individual preparing for a job. To do this, we also need resources, which raises the question of the remit and the status of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Barroso has just highlighted the need to be tuned into the citizens’ concerns. I feel that many of the concerns that I have mentioned are shared far beyond the circles close to my group. The Commission would be well advised not to ignore them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the EU, we have the wrong approach to regulation. We send officials to Brussels to set prices for products for which there is no lack of suppliers and for which there is plenty of demand. So much for the market economy. In that way, we overcharge, levy taxes and duties and prevent developing countries from selling food to us, and then hand the money out again, as subsidies tailored to the owners’ assets. A landowner with a thousand hectares receives hundreds of times more in subsidies than a farmer with ten hectares. There is no ceiling on subsidies; 20% of farmers take 80% of the subsidies. The farmers’ income is only a fraction of the subsidies for the common agricultural policy. We thus discriminate against the new Member States. We have also created a subsidy industry and an army of lobbyists who travel to Brussels to get some of our own money back again.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Commission wants more money for more plans, and the opportunity to levy new taxes itself. My advice is to try having less money, less tax, fewer subsidies and greater freedom for the Member States, and reimburse those who cannot cope successfully in the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be some natural energy and raw materials left for our descendants. It must be possible to be a pioneering country in environmental terms. We must give the poorest countries the opportunity to increase their demand by allowing them to pay less in EU subscriptions and by giving Structural Fund resources to the poorest areas in the poorest countries. Millions of citizens receive no wages because the labour market is not available to them. We have a Central Bank that gives more consideration to the price of money than to families. The EU has a common currency and a shared reticence about investment. Why not, rather, agree an across-the-board boost to investment whereby countries with balance of payments deficits increase investment by 5%, those with surpluses increase it by 7% and those with neither deficits nor surpluses increase it by 6%. In that way, everyone would sell more and obtain increased employment without anyone’s being given a black mark for their balance of payments. Economic coordination can provide much more growth and employment than the artificial jobs created through bureaucratic incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Being new, you do not need, Mr Barroso, to get caught up in the mountain of detailed regulation in Brussels. Instead, you should give freedom full rein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not often that you hear people in this Chamber speak about a vision; about bringing forward an ideal that is not swallowed up in bureaucratic detail or in the rehashing of old ideas. To that extent I would like to pay tribute to President Barroso for having the courage, politically as well as administratively, to come forward with what is truly a vision for where Europe should be in the next five to ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that he has moved away from the old convention that the Commission was above politics, because he is talking about a Commission that will be more politically focused, that will respond more to the needs of the people and the citizens within the European Union, and that can give leadership to those people within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than go back over everything that has been said by my colleagues, I would like to make three very brief points. If we want to play our part on the world stage we must first get things right within our own Union. We must ensure that there is a certainty of ideology, a certainty of programming and a certainty of strength within our own Union before we can spread that message further abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ultimately the only thing that succeeds in any political forum or any political life is when people on the ground feel their lives are improving because of the decisions that are being taken. When we speak about solidarity in this room, we very rarely mention the solidarity of ensuring that there is equality of opportunity, equality of investment, equality of education and equality of training for each and every one of our citizens. In every area where there has been growth in economic terms or in terms of social development, those have been the key elements for driving that force.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make is this: never forget our responsibility to Africa. Today, millions of people are dying because of conflict, millions are dying because of starvation and millions more will die over the next number of years because of AIDS. We must be the global leader as regards finding solutions for the problems in Africa. We must live up to our goals and our responsibilities in that sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I hope that your programme gets you to the top of the league, I would like – in the short speaking time available to me – to share two ideas with you.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like is for you, before bringing an actual proposal or directive to this House or presenting it to the public, to keep it back for a very short space of time and ask yourself: ‘Does it comply with the principle of economy?’ or ‘Might it not be possible to be less ambitious when it comes to administration, not to mention the Financial Perspective?’ Consideration of the political background leads me to say that there are times when EUR 700 billion over seven years can amount to more that EUR 1 billion for the same period.</p>
<p class="contents">My second thought follows on from that. I would ask you to take care that you do not fall into a trap by yielding to the temptation to free up funds for rearmament. That way, you may be able to create jobs in the short term, but it would be disastrous for Europe as a peace project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I should like to say to you that I find it particularly pertinent and interesting that Parliament is involved in the discussion on the multiannual programme, and, above all, in adopting it. This is new and significant; the multiannual programme will effectively be agreed upon by the Commission, the Council and Parliament. We shall also be discussing the Commission’s legislative and work programme. We would have liked to have been able to speak about this in more detail, but it is impossible because we have not had the time to study in any depth the proposals tabled by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I should hope that as politicians we can take part fully in these discussions and, most importantly, in decision-making; in other words, I should hope that it is not left to our staff and your staff to make decisions on the multiannual programme. That is not something we would wish to see. What we want, as politicians, is to decide, and in so doing become codeciders of this programme. Parliament must therefore be allowed to work with you in the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, 2005 will be a crucial year for our institutions. I should like to speak about the Constitution and its ratification. We must channel all our efforts into competitiveness and thus jobs, because poverty is unacceptable in Europe. Let us put an end to the interminable, and, unfortunately sometimes, pitiful, rhetoric, and let us put the Lisbon Strategy properly into practice. On this matter, I should like, if I may, to focus on one particular point. I am shocked to see that some people are still opposed to competitiveness and the environment, with the implication that we have learned nothing about sustainable development, despite the tragedy in Asia on 26 December and despite the fact that the scientists keep sounding the alarm as regards the drastic developments in terms of climate change and its consequences. We must understand that bringing the environment into the equation is a competitive advantage; this is the way to develop new and innovative technologies that lead, in turn, to new jobs. Competitiveness, environment and solidarity are the new European pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore keeping a watchful eye on both the REACH directive and the services directive, given that job creation should not lead to other jobs being lost. After all, our priority should be the health of our companies and at the same time the health of our people – everything is connected. Your programme is an ambitious one, Mr President of the Commission. We support you now and shall continue to support you as regards the financial perspectives, because it is important that Europe’s budget is capable of financing the priorities and the policies that we would like to implement together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, as Mr Schulz has already said, many passages in the programme you have presented reflect our thinking, and this is something I want to highlight. It is, however, in the nature of parliamentarians never to be satisfied with what they are given, and so I would like to concentrate on those points where I would ask you to take matters further.</p>
<p class="contents">Your starting point was the issue of better regulation, in other words, our need for a different way of making laws, and you also asked whether the public understand what we want. I do think that we need to concentrate, over the coming months and years, on those issues in which the public are really interested, such as that of public services, and that is where there is a lack of commitment on the part of the Commission, most particularly, in practical terms, when it comes to a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">When the public see one post office after another closing down, more and more other public facilities disappearing, and whole swathes of land laid waste, they ask themselves whether Europe is the underlying cause of it, and so I ask you not only to focus on the issue of private services, but also to give higher priority to services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, your programme begins with prosperity, and then moves on to solidarity. You repeatedly stress that the two are connected, and you are right to do so. There too, I ask you to go even further. In the European model of society, in fact, it is impossible to separate the promotion of our prosperity from solidarity, and we do not see solidarity as a hindrance to efficiency, a hindrance to competitiveness, or even – as the Nordic model demonstrates – as a hindrance to flexibility on the labour market. If we want a flexible labour market, it is all the more important that social networks should be in place to catch people if the worst comes to the worst.</p>
<p class="contents">What solidarity also means for us, though, is that the public sector must not be starved or neglected. Growth, employment, and the fair distribution of income demand not an over-expanded public sector, but one that is alive and proportionate. We need – as you rightly said – more investment in infrastructure; we need, above all, more investment in health and education, and that brings me back to services, for it is a vitally important point that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want to extend public services. On the subject of private service, though, I would like to pick up on something that Mr Juncker said: while we want the market for services to be opened up, we do not want social dumping. It is for that reason that the Services Directive is in need of revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity conjoined with prosperity does of course also mean the practice of solidarity with all groups in society, including various minorities – about which this House is now doing something – and especially the large Roma and Sinti minorities. I think this an appropriate opportunity to make that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity also, of course, means international solidarity on our part, and that brings me to my last point, that Europe is a great civil power. We may be a soft power, but soft power does not mean weak power, the two are not the same thing, and that is something I think we have to stress. If we, as the Americans now acknowledge, were so successful in Ukraine and have to continue with a rational approach, doing what has to be done in the right order, and if we are heading for success in the Balkans, then we must apply the same approach to the shaping of international policy in such places as Iran. We also have to tell our American friends – and I emphasise ‘friends’ – in plain terms that it is not acceptable to take military action first; on the contrary, we have to try, wherever possible, to apply civilian solutions through negotiation and participation; that is the European way of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in any way disregarding the fact that there are military elements in this. We may well be a great civil power, but the military element is needed if the great civil power of Europe is to be credible and capable of making itself felt.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you have come some way; we Social Democrats would like us to go even further. The fact that the USA, China and Russia have a quite different view of the world means that we increasingly have to communicate Europe’s own, even to our own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not entirely sure what the word ‘partnership’ means in this context, but I am quite sure what ‘a renewed Europe’ means, and it is my belief that a defining feature of Europe has always been its ability to undergo constant reform and successive renaissances.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw Mr Barroso’s attention to two issues I believe to be important when talking of a renewed Europe. The first of these is education. Europe has traditionally gained its strength from its education system, which provides schooling from primary to university level, yet we must be aware that this education system is currently deteriorating. It is not enough simply to say that culture and education are important, Mr President. A strategy outlining the way in which education is to be placed at the heart of the European Union’s concerns is needed. It would then be impossible to use the principle of subsidiarity to claim that the European Union institutions have no right to take action. We need a strategy that ensures European education is the best in the world, because this is what it deserves and this is one of Europe’s great traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is another issue I believe to be important, and with regard to which I also expect there to be some kind of political strategy. It is simply not true to say that democracy is an inherent characteristic of Europe. By its very nature, democracy frequently comes under attack from the powerful. At present European democracy is being weakened by populism and instances of demagogy, and this means that there should be a European strategy on democracy, which would also serve as a mouthpiece for the whole world. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

We are opposed to the approach taken by Mr Kok's committee, because it leads to less Europe, especially in the cohesion and environment sectors, and to more social dumping, which dismantles the European social state. We need ambitious, not miserly plans for the unified Europe of the future. A substantial increase in own resources is needed in order to finance the new common policies demanded by the citizens of the 25 Member States now and the 27 in future. The Commission proposal is the minimum starting point for the financial perspectives. If you want, you have a brilliant opportunity, you just have to stop constantly going backwards.

That was very helpful and will come as news to poor Michael Howard and the Conservatives in the British Parliament.</p>

No state can reverse this downturn alone; it is the duty of the European institutions, in particular the Commission, to fire up the European economy by concentrating on a strategy aimed at employment, growth and inclusive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Lisbon strategy needs to be relaunched, in a such a way that it finally becomes effective, and a national administrator should be appointed to meet its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Stability Pact needs to be revised intelligently, so as to encourage structural reforms and to facilitate pursuit of the Lisbon objectives, boosting investment in infrastructure and research to increase competitiveness. In this regard, I consider it essential to hold a debate in the European Parliament on the reform of the Stability Pact before the European Council in March.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, perhaps we need to return to the idea, originally put forward by Mr Delors, of financing European public investment to support growth and competitiveness by issuing Community bonds, which, now, would be guaranteed by the current strength of the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent strategic material clearly shows that the Commission has not only begun its work, but has also paid attention to the European Parliament. I would like to remind the House and members of the Commission who are present that last December this House adopted a resolution which defined the fundamental strategic goals of the Commission, namely those goals that the European Parliament wanted to see in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has clearly taken these goals into account. We expressed our desire for a competitive and dynamic Europe, and the Commission is talking about competitiveness, prosperity and creating job opportunities. We expressed our desire to see cohesion, the consolidation of European expansion and solidarity, and the Commission is talking about the same issues. We wanted European citizens to have a safe Europe. These goals were clearly defined in the Commission’s recently published material, and in the President’s presentation as well. This is the case, even if Members of Parliament sometimes make the Commission’s work more difficult. Let me remind you that last December’s resolution was initially backed by most of the main groups in Parliament, but our socialist colleagues reneged on their approval at the last minute. Now, however, socialists issued strident press statements before the Commission and Parliament sittings regarding their expectations of the Commission. Interestingly enough, these expectations included elements that they refused to sign or vote for at the last sitting in Strasbourg. This is why I am content to see the socialists approve of this material even though they would like to see these issues become a little redder.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw the attention of the Socialist representatives, indeed of all representatives from all Groups, to the fact that creating job opportunities is not a socialist or liberal goal; it is not the goal of the Green Party or the People’s Party, but is in the interests of European citizens. This is what we are working for, this is what we are fighting for. It is perhaps hardly surprising that I, as a representative from a new Member State, am bringing to your attention that one of the important aspects of solidarity within the European Union is to work with increased effort to create cohesion between existing and new Member States. I am confident that Mr Barroso, former Prime Minister of Portugal, a country that has enjoyed the benefits of cohesion for a long time, finds solidarity important even outside the context of generations and social strata. Finally, I would like to express our appreciation that the President of Commission undertook definite and clear commitments that the Commission will avoid steps that conflict with the interests of European citizens and that it will refrain from legislation that interferes with the goals of competitiveness and creating jobs opportunities, or infringes the security of European citizens. I wish the Commission courage to be able to refrain from action from time to time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will not happen. It will not happen because the President has presented us with a document and with his comments that indicate a step ahead from the Strasbourg Document: we use the same words and hope that behind words of the same tenor, there is hope for similar and joint political action as well. I rest assured that his cooperation with the Vice-Presidents presages a promising future and I do not want to start a debate on who likes red in neck-ties and who prefers red in ears. Let us conclude that solidarity and social cohesion are values and they have human content rather than colour.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about the issues of security and justice. I was pleased to find that security and justice were mentioned among the fundamental principles, and not simply treated as regulatory technicalities. We all know that security cannot be taken for granted and that it means more than providing a peaceful life to citizens in the face of life-threatening perils. European security policy does not end with combating the threat of terrorism and finding effective ways to prevent and tackle bombings. We believe, and I would like to emphasise this notion: democracy is the real pledge of security. Only democracy protects people, and personal rights are guaranteed by democracy in the law-making process. It is democracy that prevents the introduction, in the name of security, of restrictions that conflict with the philosophy of our Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to live in a world – we have already done so – where our dreams are written in dossiers. And neither do we want to live in a world where people are discriminated against on the basis of gender, age, religion, or financial or family status. We do not want discrimination, as it exposes the weak to tangible dangers and it is the weak who become more and more exposed: women, the elderly and children. We do not want discrimination of ‘otherness’ and this is why we keep asking you whether we can take seriously the promise of your personal commitment to anti-discriminatory legislature and to taking definite legal steps to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">There are dangers that reach far beyond security policy among the perils that threaten the quality of human life. While entrenched and irreversible poverty creates fault lines that divide continents, countries and regions within countries, solidarity and social cohesion not only strengthen competitiveness, but security as well. They prevent mass migration of the poor, and may prevent anti-poverty riots. Hence, we can say that although nature may turn against man, our joint policy may prevent man from turning against man. I hope we will be able to cooperate no matter which side of the horseshoe we sit on in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we carry on as we have been doing, we will not manage to make the EU the world’s most competitive knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, we hear Mr Poettering telling the plenary that it was not meant like that, that we do not want to become the most competitive society, that we just want to be able to compete, but, as for being Number One – no, no, that was not what we meant. That, Mr Poettering, bespeaks an attitude according to which competition is something to be talked about rather than faced up to. Sportsmen, entrepreneurs, scientists – they all want to compete and get to the top. If it were you rather than Otto Rehhagel coaching the Greek football team, Mr Poettering, they would never have got to Lisbon. The Greeks won, and we want Europe to win too. We face up to competition. We face up to competition between one economic area and another, quite simply because we have no other option. In this competition, we still have a chance; we have to use it, and we have to use it now.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Commission, in its strategy document, has not only acknowledged that, but also wants its policy to be guided by it, gives Europe an opportunity, one that we very much welcome, and on which we congratulate the Commissioners responsible, firstly Mr Barroso, but also Commissioner Verheugen and the other members of the College. It is, after all, clear that we have to focus on becoming more competitive. We must at last grasp what competitiveness is: an indispensable condition for more growth and hence also for the creation of more jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">That we do this is a matter of obligation – not merely politically, but also morally. Mass unemployment and long-term unemployment are fundamental evils in Europe, in my own country and in many other Member States. Unemployment causes poverty, and poverty is a breeding ground for social problems, problems with health, and problems affecting the environment. The best antidote to poverty is properly paid work; it brings prosperity, it gives people prospects and a sense of self-worth. Only a society possessing these characteristics can achieve ambitious social and environmental objectives. That these are connected is something your group, Mr Schulz, will have to get into their heads. Mass unemployment is not a social benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">With five wasted years behind us, now is the time to get started on implementing the Lisbon targets. The Commission has reached out a hand in partnership; we should, for our people’s sake, seize it. I might add that I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barroso’s yielding to pressure from Parliament in the autumn of 2004 evoked the image of a powerful Parliament against a powerless Commission. I should like to ask Mr Barroso whether that is an image with which he can identify.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, the Commission is facing the thankless task of keeping the referenda on the Constitution on the right track, but it has only itself to blame for having got itself into this predicament. Although the Commission is always claiming that ratification is, above all, a task for the nation state, and rightly so, this clear line has, unfortunately, been abandoned. By launching an active campaign and releasing funds, the Commission has lost its neutral stance. The public’s own tax money is now being used to fund the imposition on it of a constitution for which it never asked in the first place. The European Constitution campaign is meant to bring the citizen closer to Europe, but, if we jump the gun, it remains to be seen whether the public will feel they are being taken seriously. For example, a great deal of work is already being done behind the scenes with regard to the form the European external service should take. National parliaments and citizens, however, have not been consulted, precisely at a time when Commissioner Wallström indicated that Europe should start listening to its citizens now instead of pursuing a policy of <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not know how to explain to the citizens of the Czech Republic, whom I represent here, what this Europeanism actually is. I cannot say which of the present Commissioners and Members possess more or better Europeanism. I do not know what criteria are currently used to distinguish between a good and a bad European. I come from a country where, for decades, people did not get ahead as a result of their abilities, education, initiative and efficiency, but as a result of how loudly and how often they declared their commitment to a single political idea. Today, the countries of eastern Europe are still paying dearly for this way of running society in terms of economic backwardness.

We are therefore entitled to defend the Constitution to the public, and we are glad that the Commission is joining us in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment I would like to make has to do with the Foreign and Security Policy. I think the Commission has put forward a lot of good proposals and that it has the right idea – using the European Union’s economic strength to give it a voice in foreign policy and also drawing on the latest developments, in particular the Constitution. I would say to Mr Schulz that I think it is quite clear that prevention has to have priority, but prevention is ineffective without military capacities, which are the only means whereby pressure may be brought to bear. Both are necessary, but the use of armed force can only ever be the means of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union also have to take care not to do this unilaterally, but as part of a multilateral framework. What this means is that we have to develop our trans-Atlantic relationships. I wish the Presidents of the Council and the Commission all the best for 22 February, when President Bush comes here and we start to make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point I would like to address in the short time available to me. Tomorrow, President Yushchenko will be with us, and I think it has become clear to us over recent days – not least through debates in this House – that we cannot, right now, keep on enlarging the European Union <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>, for that would make it incapable of welcoming new members. We also see, though, that the action programmes under the neighbourhood policy for Eastern Europe are inadequate. I would ask that we should think up some new ideas in this area, including multilateral frameworks, which might draw on such ideas as the European Economic Area. I see this as the only way in which we can reduce pressure and build up prospects, both of which are crucial at this present time, and I hope that this can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">My last word must be to the President of the Commission, whom I urge to resist any attempts by the Council to structure the European External Action Service in such a way that it is not dependent on the Commission. We want a community Europe and not a new intergovernmental authority. Parliament is on your side.</p>

That is something that I too believe as Chairman of the European Social Democrats. Clearly, we are in agreement. I must, however, say one more thing to you. Those of us in the PSE have a common allergy. Our allergy consists in reacting badly to mere lip service. My point is that it is very important, Mr Barroso, for you now really to take seriously what Mr Schulz has said today – something on which I should like to comment. It is important for your statements today to be followed up by practical action. Allow me to give you some examples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, what you said today about the gap between rich and poor within the EU needing to become narrower. When, then, I see, on the front page of today’s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, your Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, saying that regional aid in the rich countries too must be scaled down, I perceive an inconsistency. You should be careful, Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, what you said today about our needing to create more and better jobs. Both Mr Schulz and I agree. Be careful, however, that old-fashioned recipes from the last century are not applied, based on the view that it was enough simply to talk about productivity and structural changes and not about what we need, namely greater investment and stronger demand in the European internal market. It is no use just focusing upon the supply side; in a modern economy, the demand side too must be focused upon. Without coordinated investment in training, innovation, regional policy and an active labour market policy, we do not get the jobs. I do not believe that you disagree, but I would ask you to confirm today that this is how the Commission President also sees matters. I would remind you that, six months ago, we presented an investment programme consisting of five points concerning five million new jobs in Europe. The programme can in fact be implemented and, as President of the Commission, you will have a crucial share of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">When, today, you talk about the European social model, I agree with you, but be careful that we do not separate matters. It is very important that you should not let yourself be pressurised by old-fashioned thinking in the European Union into first focusing upon economic productivity and only then seeing if we can afford more welfare and, if need be, more social security and more environmental investment. Take care; these matters are inseparable from one another. We must insist upon the European social model, economic productivity, social justice and environmental investment. That is the European way.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, the challenge we both face can be summarised in the question: shall we compete in Europe under American or European conditions? That is what is at issue. We must find the answer together, and I am certain that we can do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to what the President of the Council, Mr Juncker, said not so very long ago when he emphasised that the European way involves a balance between the economy, social conditions and the environment. We expect to see this balance on 2 February when the first proposal comes from the Commission, enabling us to begin work.</p>

I would like to thank President Barroso for having drawn substantively upon the outcome of Parliament’s approval process for the new Commission. The programme deserves serious reaction from Parliament and from the European Council. To put the emphasis on prosperity as a first priority is certainly brave. There are few levers at the disposal of the Commission or the Council to control macro-economic policy. The Union has extremely limited fiscal power. Therefore the completion of the single market in services – financial and also public – is not a luxury: it is crucial. Personally, I would have wished to have seen greater stress on the importance of certain other Member States, including the UK, embracing the single currency within the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso said that bringing the Constitution into force is a first step to greater legitimacy. It must be said that it is a prerequisite for almost everything else that we find inside the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, without the planned improvements to a common foreign, security and defence policy, the Union will be unable to play an effective part in global affairs, and relations with Russia and the USA will remain feeble and prone to quarrels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that it is also a programme for the long term. I am adopting your programme and I am expressing my support for it because I believe that it is a programme which is good not just for the Commission but, in a broader sense, also for the Council and even for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You have heard today a largely positive reaction and it is clear that you have also heard our comments made at other sittings. One important step is now behind you, but the second is to achieve these targets. You will only be able to succeed in this if you can engage the Council and if you can also engage the Parliament in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">This period will also see the ratification of the Treaty establishing the European Constitution in the European Union. We are now persuading people that we have prepared this document for them, for the citizens of the European Union, that it is the European Union which will offer them protection if a nation state fails.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has devoted huge resources to the countries affected by the natural disaster of the tsunami. In Europe, however, we are witnesses to millions of victims of economic reforms, an economic tsunami – young people have fled eastern Europe in search of better conditions in western Europe, but the elderly are dependent upon our help. The European Union and Africa are afflicted every year by the AIDS tsunami. Tens of thousands are dying. I am therefore asking you to help these people. I also offer you my help with the programmes for old people and for those suffering from AIDS, but I also reserve the right to monitor these programmes.</p>

Being the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for development cooperation, it was with that in mind that I read the programme. The programme rightly notes that the European Union is responsible not only for the peace, prosperity and well-being of people in the European Union itself, but also has a responsibility with regard to the rest of the world, particularly the poorest countries. Five years ago, we in the European Union, together with other countries, adopted the so-called millennium objectives, which set out how we want to meet that responsibility. World poverty was to be halved by 2015, everyone was at least to enjoy basic education, the position of women was to be improved, the fight against AIDS stepped up and sustainable development promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have fallen behind on achieving those objectives, they are still realistic. The European Union is doing a great deal, but much is yet to be done, especially in the areas of cohesion, cooperation and coordination. Those millennium objectives will not be achieved unless the international community, unless we in the European Union, considerably improve the quality of our aid. Resources can, and should, be deployed more effectively. At last week’s meeting of our Committee, Mr Sachs, of the UN’s millennium project challenged us with regard to the role of the European Union in the world, to which the work programme also makes reference. The European Union is still the largest donor, and the challenge is also to be the largest player on the stage in terms of vision, cohesion and leadership. In the area of development cooperation, too, there are very, very great challenges to be faced. I would call on the Commission to give this further careful consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You effectively have a five-year mandate ahead of you and you have an extraordinary challenge – finally to put in place this Lisbon Strategy by providing it with real instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a privileged position, but also a paradoxical one, because, as you mentioned at the lunchtime press conference, when you were Prime Minister, you were not very keen on the Lisbon Strategy. We noticed this during the hearings, too. Today, however, your new responsibilities mean that this programme is now yours. It also represents the best means at your disposal to put the Union back on track and to enable it to face the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, today’s sitting is virtually a trial run for you to prepare what you are going to say to us next Wednesday, the substance of which is making the Lisbon Strategy the European project for the coming years. If you want to succeed in this perspective, you must ensure that this is based on the following three pillars: financial perspectives aimed at implementing the strategy; a stability pact that enables growth and competitiveness to take place in the Union in terms of sustainable development and employment; and EU policies that work towards this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to strike the right balance, the most important thing is not to undervalue the social dimension, which, being in fact at the heart of the European social model’s elements of competitiveness, and of Europe’s strength, including international competitiveness, must not be pushed aside. This is what we are expecting of you and it is on the basis of a programme of your activities in this respect – your legislative programme – that we shall judge you, text by text in a European spirit, that is to say, with the desire to move forward in the service of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am not so much talking about the effects on demand of the large amount of investment required to build TENs, which ought to contribute to an increase in economic growth. In the framework of the Lisbon Strategy we should already have solved all the diplomatic, design and funding problems and now we should be ready to translate the investment into spending. In reality, that will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Solid European cofinancing commitments for TENs, however, need to be drawn up before the financial perspectives are approved for 2006-2013 and possibly for a time horizon including the period after 2013, up to 2020. While we cannot expect rapid effects on demand from implementing TENs, we can instead expect a real and progressive contribution to the effective creation of the internal market in the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of time and financial constraints, however, this result can only be achieved if the TEN implementation strategy is not left, so to speak, to the discretion of the Member States and to their local decisions, and to their ability or inability to cofinance the various sections and various projects. In fact, it is only in Brussels that the sections of the network can be identified. Their construction will have the effect of really creating a single market which is greater than others, albeit in the knowledge that the network effect will only be created with the completion of all the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this will only be possible if European cofinance is increased and, in certain notable cases, only if the Member States agree to an exceptional pooling of resources to construct TENs, which surely is incompatible with cutting the resources transferred to the Union by the Member States to 1% of European GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">This possible increased financial responsibility of the European Union could also have the benefit of allowing a useful revision of the Stability Pact. Breaking the 3% ceiling could only be permitted if objectively linked to the above-mentioned infrastructures, as well as to research spending, and subjectively guaranteed by the executive Commission. It would be the Commission’s task to use the increased resources according to European priority criteria, such as making a greater contribution to unifying the market in the enlarged European Union, as I mentioned before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The emphasis the Commission places on creating prosperity in Europe is welcome and overdue. Central to success will be the outcome of the Lisbon Strategy – a review which will be discussed at the Spring European Council – and the language used on competitiveness, entrepreneurship, research, growth and jobs is more robust than under the last Commission. Mr Barroso, I believe that you are personally committed to genuine economic reform in Europe. Your record as Prime Minister of Portugal demonstrates you were interested in results, not simply rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain cautious about the potential of both the Commission and certain Member States in terms of the need for effective and tough reform of Europe’s economies. The revised Lisbon Strategy must not be weighed down with political correctness, as in the past. Much has now changed – enlargement of the European Union has brought in countries which are strongly committed to flexible labour markets, to competitive taxation policies and the development of free trade. In addition, we face the major challenges of competing not just with the United States, but with the emerging giants in China and India. Europe simply cannot go on talking about reform to meet these challenges; it must now deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the emphasis on Member States applying EU legislation in their own countries. In the United Kingdom we have sometimes had a tendency to enforce legislation over-enthusiastically, while other Member States have a tendency at times to minimise the effects of the legislation they do not like. That is, of course, unacceptable. We must deliver less regulation, whether in the economic sphere or elsewhere. Previous Commissions talked about this. This Commission must deliver and we must make matters simpler – simpler for the people to understand and simpler to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">We will judge this Commission partly on its effectiveness in creating the environment for real reform, its commitment to less and better regulation and its determination to ensure that taxpayers’ money is used efficiently, while fraud and mismanagement are tackled with great vigour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I missed in his speech, however, was any emphasis on the need to maintain and enhance social dialogue. What I have in mind here is negotiations between trade unions and employers’ associations at all levels, including the European level. I am convinced that everything which has been achieved in post-war Europe is the result of cooperation between sensible governments, employers’ organisations and trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">When looking at the proposals intended to help make Europe more competitive, its labour market more flexible and the business conditions more transparent and simple, I cannot help feeling that the last obstacle to actually achieving this are, in many people’s eyes, the democratically established powerful trade union organisations. Unfortunately, we are today witnesses to the fact that, especially in some of the countries which have recently acceded, representatives of the conservative parties are confusing social dialogue with social monologue. There have been attempts to replace industrial relations which have been in existence for more than a century with individual relations. This is supported by primitive arguments to the effect that all individuals are freely able to make decisions and assert themselves in the labour market. It is therefore a good thing that our group is placing emphasis on the creation of more, but also better jobs. Europe does not and never will want what American trade unionists fittingly call McJobs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many ways in which to dismantle a social state and some of them have unfortunately been tried with success in formerly wealthy and stable countries in the South American region. Therefore, no privatisation of public services, no privatisation of pension systems. I find most European labour legislation satisfactory, but what I find unsatisfactory is the inadequate control over what is approved and what is subsequently not observed and even contravened in some Member States. Mr President, how are you going to ensure that good European directives do not simply remain pieces of paper? Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that renewal should really be the key word in the coming years, and I warmly welcome the similar noises I have heard from the presidency. We desperately need renewal, particularly in the economy. Although many Members have pointed to the drawbacks and possible pitfalls that reforms entail, I think we should spend more time talking about the drawbacks and pitfalls of the <span class="italic">status quo</span>. Reform requires political courage. Choices need to be made and political positions adopted. I hope that this Commission, unlike its predecessor, is prepared to do just that, rather than carry on tabling watered-down consensus proposals without any substance. Change almost always hurts. Change affects the vested interests, which perhaps partly explains the resistance that is being put up in certain circles. The longer we postpone the reforms, though, the greater the pain. Mr Barroso, we have a saying in the Netherlands to the effect that desperate times call for desperate measures. I do not know how you would translate that, but I think the message is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is much talk about innovation, we are still investing in old systems, like an old agricultural system designed for the priorities of the Fifties, and social security systems designed for society half a century ago. We are still spending a great deal of public money to keep doomed and polluting industries afloat. We are still trying to solve the economic problems by running up public deficits. I hope that this Commission will press for investments in expertise and skills, in education, innovation, the environment and the services market, and I would call on the presidency and the Member States to do the same. I hope that the Commission will simply stick to its guns. Instead of old policies, we should invest in free markets, open markets, initiative and entrepreneurship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore hope that the Commission dares to prioritise and to choose a focus in the form, obviously, of what is most important, namely growth. There is no magic about creating growth. In actual fact, everyone knows what needs to be done and why Europe is slipping behind, but there are few who dare talk about it.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in reality, is needed is not more power or money for the EU, but political courage. Courage is needed to dare to stand up and implement a number of radical reforms designed to obtain the competitiveness we need and to get away from over-regulation and over-taxation of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">An important tool for increased growth is free trade. The EU should be the European power, and the world’s strongest power, fighting specifically for free world trade. The EU project is based upon free trade and upon creating peace, prosperity and freedom. It can be of a very great deal of help in other parts of the world too.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the EU often does the opposite and instead sets up further barriers to trade. Poor and vulnerable countries are robbed of prosperity and opportunities through customs duties. The immorality of this became additionally clear when, in December, the EU increased the duties on perfumes and spices from countries such as Thailand and Sri Lanka. Those countries that have been affected by the tsunami disaster need trade in order to pursue their own development, and they definitely do not need new customs duties. The fact that Europe too loses out due to what is an immoral policy is becoming clearer than ever now that Thailand is talking about refusing to buy the prestige European Airbus as a consequence of the trade policy that imposes duties on fishermen specifically in Thailand.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to call upon the Commission to do everything it can to stand up for free trade and to try to go down in history as the European Commission that was most friendly to free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lisbon can be compared to a pyramid: at its top is Research and Development, which for us is both a tool and an opportunity, although only two countries have implemented this 3% objective for GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The next level down is taken up by ICT, the information and communications industry. It is both a means of accomplishing objectives and the fastest growing way of producing results. ICT’s share of our gross domestic product is already approximately 10%. Digital literacy is vital therefore, because, for example, the majority of our office workers lose around three hours of working time every week due to computer problems. What are we to do? Should we extend the working week or should we teach digital literacy?</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we need to remember that the top of the pyramid will cave in if it is not founded on socially and environmentally sustainable development. That is our European model, the precondition for our competitiveness. I am pleased that you, Mr Barroso, include solidarity as a basis for our success, but there is still much to be done. Non-solidarity, that western import, is becoming more and more evident at all levels of our society and between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy as its objective. The power of decision, however, remains with the Member States. Only a small minority have implemented the necessary legislation. The non-solidarity movement therefore reigns within us. The Union’s goal of competitiveness will not be achieved if the majority of Member States apply the brakes. I would like to ask Mr Barroso how the Commission intends to persuade the Member States to implement the agreed laws jointly. Otherwise, it is to be feared that this will become a Soviet-style five-year plan, which will only be implemented on paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is simply that, as usual, there are so many goals that there is a danger of there being no prioritisation at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to create an EU that is slimmer but sharper edged, that does less but is better at what it does and that takes vigorous action on issues of common interest, while leaving other issues to be decided at national, regional or local levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Stable and sustained growth is needed in Europe. The EU’s competitiveness needs to be improved, perhaps more than we think. The United States is now discussing the growth that exists in China and is making ambitious plans for achieving the same levels. Meanwhile, we in Europe are still discussing the United States. In that way, we are already several steps behind. Europe has huge potential for growth, which must be released, but it needs to muster its strength and to prioritise. Otherwise, the Lisbon process is in danger of bearing out Groucho Marx’s statement that ‘[p]olitics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it, misdiagnosing it, and then misapplying the wrong remedies’. Sustainable development is the basis for growth, and the programme is too weak where this aspect is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, freedom of movement within the EU presupposes that people feel they have legal security when they leave their own countries to study, work or take holidays in other Member States. Unfortunately, there are at present far too many people who have not obtained the right to fair trials and legally secure treatment when they have been suspected of committing crimes in other countries. Common guarantees in this area are, of course, in preparation, but we have now waited so many years for these. It is important for these issues of legal security to be resolved so that people dare to make use of the four freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in the first half of 2005; we are also discussing the financial framework – the very financial framework that will be your concern, Mr Barroso, throughout your term of office. That being so, I expect your proposals to take into consideration what financial instruments are available to you to enable you to actually accomplish the things you have set yourself to do. I have no sympathy whatever for your desire to continue handling budgetary payments in the same way as the previous Commission did. There, I think, the Commission has some more catching up to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is also true where own resources are concerned. How does the European Union fund itself? This is where the Commission could perhaps put some new proposals before us as to how we embark on a time of innovation – not only in its work programme, but also in the European Union’s financial arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me raise something that I have already often had to speak about, both here and in Strasbourg: you are quite right to say that Europe has to make sure it can compete and must create jobs. We are eagerly waiting for the Commission to revise the proposal that the colleague to the left of you, Mrs Wallström, brought in when she was Commissioner for the Environment for this mammoth REACH project, which enhances the competitiveness of industries outside the European Union rather than that of those within it. If you want to do something to help create jobs, then withdraw REACH and take a closer look at the whole thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I read that Commissioner Kyprianou wants to regulate even the grilling of hamburgers, the last area of employment left to us. I thought we had seen the last of this sort of nonsense when Mr Byrne finally departed the scene. You have to consider which model of society you are defending – one in which people are free or one in which they are led by the nose? I supported you because I thought you were in favour of freedom, so I would ask you to introduce some! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what Mr Ferber said a moment ago somehow forces me to speak about the REACH dossier – as I am the rapporteur on it – which Mr Ferber held up as the greatest threat to the competitiveness of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I hold exactly the opposite view. I think it is always wrong to turn a specific piece of legislation into a symbol of either good or evil. In any case, I think that if REACH is a symbol, it is precisely pointing the way towards a new competitive future for Europe’s industry.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in the world to leave our competitiveness in crisis and in question? We are witnessing a great international redistribution of work, as has happened before at other times in world economic and industrial history. Europe has not yet succeeded in finding its own space, its own trump cards, in this great transformation. It identified them in the Lisbon strategy, but it has only been able to develop and expand them in a very small way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I recognise that the list of priorities that you have indicated, for which an interinstitutional partnership ought to be established, is a fair one and I believe that it is precisely on that basis that we need to address this major turning point in Europe’s competitiveness. Our trump cards are knowledge and the environment. Europe is going to become a world leader in those areas, and it is now in a position to achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure everyone in this Chamber thinks we want to achieve that; the question now arises of how we do it. Some of it Europe can afford, and I would urge you to focus your work programme rather more on the self-employed and small businesses instead of solely on large-scale industries or on more innovative sectors; important though these certainly are, most businesses – truism though it is to say so – are small ones or one-man operations. Your programme does not, unfortunately, do justice to their importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing I want to say is that you have to monitor the Member States in this respect and point out when they have to implement the necessary reforms. I have high expectations of the Commission actually doing that, but I have to say that, having first vowed to stand up to the Council, the Commission gave up even before embarking on its first contest with them. That brings me to the Stability and Growth Pact. Look at your Commission and the Commissioner with responsibility for these matters; it is apparent to me from the statements he makes that all he is doing is picking the Council’s proposals to pieces. Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, I think back to the time when Mr Juncker joined us in Committee and said: ‘You have to learn’. He was right: politicians, too, have to learn. The problem with the Pact is that it is those who offend against it – the finance ministers – who decide among themselves whether or not the Pact is to apply. You ought to fight to have the Commission given greater power in this area. In the areas we are discussing, though, it is unfortunate that the Commission is not doing that, but simply walking behind the Council and making life even easier for it. This is where Mr Solbes was a good example of the sort of commitment required, and a good yardstick by which to measure it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in addition, urge you not to indulge in the Prodi Commission’s obstructive tactics, for the Commissioners at the time, who played a part in them, had their work cut out – Mrs Wallström, who is here today, spent five years helping to make Europe the most competitive area. Judge by the results, and, if you do not make a quick job of putting a stop to bureaucracy, you will end up the same way as the Prodi Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have created and continue to create a certain amount of unanimity around yourself and your intentions. Having said that, I would like to strike a more downbeat note.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to you, we should be channelling our efforts into turning Europe into the most competitive economy and from the competitiveness thus achieved there would be a flood of jobs that would benefit everyone. Mr President, I do not share that view and there are a number of us who do not share that view. This is because your programme does not provide the right responses to the problems encountered by Europe and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, at the moment, economic growth is too weak and must be stepped up. How should this be done, though, and for whom? The by-products of growth should help to improve our citizens’ lives, should be shared by everyone, and should favour the less-privileged members of society. Apart from the lack of jobs, our citizens are suffering from insecurity of employment. Our healthcare, social security and retirement systems are under threat. With the advent of globalisation, more and more people are feeling insecure about their lives. Now more than ever the Union needs a strong political plan, but in order to achieve the Europe that we want, we need that strong political plan to come from a social perspective, a plan for society that enables every individual to lead a fulfilling life, a plan based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want our children to continue to enjoy a high standard of education that is accessible to all, if we want public services to continue to strengthen social cohesion, if we want jobs to enable each individual to lead a decent, fulfilling life and if we want older people to have a proper retirement, we must do much more than stake our entire future on the uncertain rewards of a policy of competitiveness at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in your programme, you could, in my opinion, have placed greater emphasis on strengthening the EU’s social dimension, because it is precisely policies of this nature that are at the forefront of the citizens’ concerns, and I feel that you have not done this. Far from it, in fact; it strikes me that when our social protection systems and our public services come under attack, it is the citizens of Europe who stand to suffer from the proposals that you are tabling. In this respect, Mr President, I should like to ask you to make the right decision and withdraw Mr Bolkestein’s draft directive, which in its current form would not be acceptable to us.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like, though, to make one observation, namely that it will not be possible to assess many of the action points you have mentioned until March and April when we know what the renewed Lisbon process brings, and, while I am on that subject, there is one aspect of the Lisbon process that gives me slight cause for concern. We are all talking about a strategy, the strategy in which competition, growth, more jobs, but also sustainability, are central. It is impossible to lift one element from a strategy. You have spoken about social sustainability, rightly so, but I have not heard you utter one word about ecological sustainability, which should be part and parcel of the Lisbon strategy if it is to work. I am therefore assuming that social and ecological sustainability will soon be given more attention in the Lisbon process.</p>

I do not actually find in it – although you will perhaps return to this later – any reference to mobility in Europe, about the need for us not only to sort out the financial services issue, but also that of qualifications, and to ensure that a migrant worker or tradesman feels at home in Europe. For this to happen, we must ensure that more jobs are created.</p>

Most chemicals we depend on, some we handle with care and some need to be phased out or banned. We need a workable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">REACH as such is costly, would take some 50 years to implement and would lose some six million lives of animals in the process.

What matters most, however, is that it be implemented. We will not be able to assess you until such time as we receive the concrete policy measures, and I urge that this be done at the earliest opportunity. If you take Lisbon’s social pillar seriously, I would ask of you three things. First of all, that all new proposals be verified in terms of their social implications and not only in competitive terms, as is indicated in the Commission document. Secondly, that the Commission should finally enact a framework directive regulating services of general interest, which are vital for social cohesion and solidarity. Thirdly, that you, Mr Barroso, create clarity about the services directive. Commissioner Verheugen has said that the REACH proposal will be adapted and will undergo a general overhaul. I would ask the same from you, and for an undertaking in respect of the Bolkestein directive: that there will be an internal market in services, but without social dumping, something on which the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, has also insisted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think your policy is the right one; you are trying to ensure that Europe does not spend the time until 2010 following those countries’ policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Commissioner Wallström which countries have actually created jobs. Who has created the most new jobs? Who has cut taxes? Who has achieved a Budget surplus? The fact that we have these two paths before us is something of which I think we have to remind ourselves. Do we want the one or the other? The Commission under Mr Barroso has made it quite clear that the Lisbon Strategy is intended, between now and 2010, to create new jobs, increase wages in real terms and put Europe in a better position as regards global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that, we have to invest in research. I believe that we have to double the funding for the Sixth Framework Programme. Although it has already been laid down in black and white, I believe we also have to get all 25 countries to conform to it; we have to take inflation into account and also lay down a proper timeframe for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work to at last complete the internal market, to have a competitive system for transporting energy across borders, and it is vitally important that we use <span class="italic">e-</span>Government, <span class="italic">e-</span>Learning, and <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe to make what Europe is about accessible once and for all. There is much to be done. I think Commissioner Wallström has to be supported by all of us in making the European Union present and visible to the European citizens of the future. This is where we have a lot to offer, and, here in this House too, we have to think up completely new ways of becoming more comprehensible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me suggest that the repayments to the Member States should be made conditional on added value to Europe and on subsidiarity, thus ensuring that the European Budget is actually used to benefit the public.</p>

<p class="contents">The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – which I have the privilege of leading for the PPE-DE Group – will work with you and your services to achieve those twin aims. The internal market is absolutely crucial in this respect, with 2005 marking a critical stage in the process, and I am delighted that you have identified the huge growth potential of services in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the internal market for services is quite rightly an ambitious and wide-ranging project. Members on my side of the House will work with you to deliver the growth market for services by pushing ahead with that important directive. Changes may be needed in order for it to work, but you have our backing. Do not listen to the siren voices on the other side of the House urging you to slow down.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this internal market for services directive so important? It is important because we must move the internal market forward to the next stage, where Member States start to trust each other to organise and control the market. We must make mutual recognition work, be it for goods or services. Why can we not have country of origin control of business establishment? Why can we not exchange information between administrations? Why can we not trust governments to deliver? Members on the other side of the House do not want this directive because they do not trust governments to deliver. Indeed, the word ‘trust’ does not appear. However, I know you will not back down, and hope that you will take forward with the Council the task of making the internal market work and of ensuring that internal market rules are enforced properly on the ground so that we can achieve our goals of a better environment and jobs and prosperity for everyone.</p>

You can order everything conceivable via every conceivable kind of electronic connection, but to trade goods – whether a fridge or a computer – you have to actually deliver the thing, and for that you need a proper transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Vice-President, Commissioner Barrot, has made a very sensible statement outlining what we need, and I want now to recapitulate the three core issues. I believe that the internal market needs to be made a reality in the railway sector too. For 40 years, the railways have thought there was no such thing and that they could carry on making railway policy at national level. Now is the time to use the Third Railway Package to open up the passenger transport networks, and to bring in a single locomotive drivers’ licence, thereby doing away with the need for trains to stop and change crew at national borders. The only way we will be able to use railways for cross-border transport is if they are fast, efficient and well-organised, and for that the networks need to be opened up, there needs to be a locomotive drivers’ licence, but passengers also have to have proper rights when they are left standing waiting or when their journeys are delayed. The rules on compensation for air travellers are very good, but far more people travel by train, and they are just as entitled to compensation when the railways fail to organise themselves properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the railways, there is the issue of the ‘Eurovignette’. Infrastructure costs need to be charged in a fair way, one that also has to be economically sustainable and structured in an environmentally-friendly way. This is an area in which we have to make headway.</p>
<p class="contents">My final and crucial point, Mr President, is one that I trust you have already taken to heart. We need proper trans-European transport routes, not only as part of the rail and road networks, but also in the inland waterways sector. We really do need cross-border transport routes and a network of all means of transport, so that we can make real advances in the trade of goods. They need to be competitive, they need to be economically sustainable, and they need to be laid out in such a way that they do no damage to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor could it be otherwise, given that this year, 2005, will also be a crucial year for the future of regional policy. Within this framework, I should like to make two very specific comments: the first comment concerns the timing of decisions. I trust that decisions will be taken during the Luxembourg Presidency and I should also like, along these lines, to ask Mr Schmit, the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, to do his very best, because regional policy programmes are multiannual programmes and any delay would have adverse repercussions on the development of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have problems during the next period and we must all, each for his own part, do whatever we can this year to bring the decision making to a close. The second element which I should like to highlight concerns the size of the new financing package for regional policy. I wish to be perfectly clear: we cannot go below the European Commission's proposals, which talk of 0.41% of gross national income for cohesion policies. If we go below that, there can be no talk of a credible regional policy, because we have far more needs with enlargement and these needs will have to be financed. Consequently, I think that we need to move in this direction. I believe that you will also have the support of the European Parliament, but we must not forget that we cannot want more Europeans with enlargement, but less Europe. If we want more Europeans, we must also want more Europe. We need to understand that an efficient Union also means a Union with financing. I understand the needs of the taxpayers, I want to be realistic in my approach, I have no desire to be maximalist but, on the other hand, I think that realism dictates that we follow the European Commission's proposal which, I repeat, makes provision for 0.41% of gross national income in regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have to do with rural development and how it is to be funded. The Commission has presented us with its proposals on the subject, and we are working on them. In principle, the Commission’s approach is to be welcomed; only recently, Commissioner Fischer Boel gave us to understand that the proposals on rural development had to be – and were – in line with the Lisbon process. That is something we in this House will take on board.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, rural development is also and especially a matter of funding, and we have to keep a very close eye on the work of the temporary committee on the 2007 – 2013 Financial Perspective as far as this matter is concerned. Unless we know what the financial facts and possibilities are, there is no point in us discussing what and how much Lisbon will do about rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the WTO, the 2003 agricultural reforms have increased our margin for negotiation in the agriculture sector; now we have to use it, while adopting a defensive stance in order to maintain the European model of agriculture. If one disregards the issue of its implementation at national level, which is a cause of concern to quite a few of us in this House, the 2003 agriculture reform left a number of issues outstanding. The markets in sugar, fruit and vegetables are ripe for reform, as is the wine sector. In all these sectors, we should wait and see what practical proposals the new Commission comes up with; nothing is to be gained by poking around in the dark. No doubt Commissioner Fischer Boel is perfectly well acquainted with the aspects that matter to this House, and it remains to be seen to what extent her proposals will take our concerns into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to give some thought to renewable energies, which I believe provide a good alternative source of income for our farmers if there is proper support for them.</p>

There was not much evidence today of the desire to ‘give Europe a soul’. When you reported on your work programme, words like ‘culture’, ‘education’ and ‘schooling’ occurred less frequently than any of us in the Committee on Culture and Education would have wished, particularly as we are all well aware that these areas have a very great part to play in the process of integration and in the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it really is time for all these speeches and symposia to be backed up by actions that the public will sit up and notice, actions that they will welcome as adding value to Europe. You did admittedly say earlier that investment in education is important, in that it promotes growth and employment, but what you say must, of course, be reflected in what you do. I would add to that the need for the Commission to create more incentives to learn languages, for learning languages is important. Learning your neighbour’s language matters, because it builds another bridge between you and them, and our young people’s mobility in the internal market depends on it.</p>
<p class="contents">It truly would be great if you, Mr President of the Commission, were really to take up the cause of the new ‘Lifelong Learning’ programme, and if the money that I, on behalf of my fellow Members, have been demanding for it, were actually to be forthcoming. That would be in line with what you are seeking through the Lisbon strategy. The preamble to the new Constitution speaks of the need to strengthen Europe’s ‘unity in diversity’, but if that is to happen, the Member States have to come round to accepting that there is such a thing as a European cultural area and have to enjoy its advantages. The culture industry creates an enormous number of jobs. Like education and schooling, it is compatible with the Lisbon strategy. It is quite simply ridiculous, and shameful, that only 0.03% of the total budget is allocated to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you, Mr President, and all your fellow Commissioners, to invest in education and culture; by so doing, you will really help Europe to gain a soul.</p>

I want to sum them up under four headings.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that your programme includes better regulation<span class="italic"> </span>and impact assessment, which could be summed up as the business of estimating the cost of compliance with laws. I would like to make it quite clear that our Committee attaches particular importance to the text of this agreement being taken seriously and to you not merely signing affirmations, like the one your predecessor signed in December 2003. That means that proper consultation processes have to be gone through, and there also – quite crucially – has to be sufficient transparency and, in contrast to what has often, unfortunately, happened with Commission proposals, a real impact assessment rather than one that can be said to do no more than help to justify the proposal. We have our own expectations in this respect and are addressing them to the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am glad you have addressed a number of aspects of the Company Law Action Plan that had already been put forward by the former Commission, I want to draw attention to two that we regard as important. One is the need for a proposal on the right to choose between the single-tier and two-tier systems of company law, and the second is that the ‘one share, one vote’ principle – which was the subject of very in-depth discussion during the previous legislative period – must be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to intellectual property rights, we welcome the Commission’s intention to present a proposal on the regulation of rights management societies. At the same time, though, we ask it to examine the rightness or otherwise of its strategy to date in relation to the European patent, with a view to finding out whether there is the danger, in view of the current state of discussions in the Council, of what comes out at the other end being a monstrosity that small and medium-sized businesses cannot afford. Perhaps we should wait for the Constitution and then produce a new proposal on a new legal basis and with new majorities, out of which something decent will emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least comes something of which I ask you not to lose sight. I believe that the most important proposal for the making of ‘soft law’ in the term of this Parliament will be the harmonisation of civil law. Groups of professors are currently working on a frame of reference for this, which will shape European civil law for over a century to come. I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to bear that, too, in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People judge whether the Commission and this Parliament are successful or not on the basis of whether we can offer them security in their own country, in their own homes, and in Europe. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I therefore very much welcome the proposed strategic guidelines and basic principles, and the priorities that have been set.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to take this opportunity to point out that political will and practical implementation are often not the same thing. The improved monitoring and surveillance of our enlarged Europe’s external borders are within the scope of the tasks outlined by the Commission, and in this it has our wholehearted support, but one thing that will be crucial in terms of its success will be whether or not the Council will once and for all resolve the issue of where the Borders Agency is to be based, thereby enabling it to start functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to effective controls, the introduction of European passports and visa documents that are proof against counterfeiting and falsification would be a good starting point, as would the inclusion of biometric data in these documents. Progress must also be made with operational cooperation by police forces in a Europe with open internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is European machinery rather than national measures; on that, this House agrees with the Commission, but the Council has for over a year been unable to agree on a new head for Europol. Whilst assuring the Commission and its President that we are alongside them in this, I would appeal to the Council to again give its attention to the points I have enumerated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also share your strategic choices in order for us to achieve this vision. We shall, moreover, also have the opportunity to discuss the individual policies both within the framework of our political groups and within the framework of our parliamentary committees, as well as other opportunities for discussion and cooperation with you. At the end of this day rich in ideas and discussions, I should like to point out that the efforts we need to make are many, varied, interactive and inter-dependent. They relate to all aspects of our economy and society. No-one can say that the economy is more important than social cohesion, that transport is more important than equal opportunities for both sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy we have followed over recent years has not borne the fruit we expected in terms of either growth or social cohesion. We have no room for either inertia or delay. The survival of our social model, the credibility of the European Union, the belief of citizens in this vision are being judged. We experienced this acutely during the recent European elections and we promised the citizens that we would change everything. The hour is therefore nigh for us to implement these changes. The reality and the challenges we have before us demand boldness, changes and innovation. We have spent enough years talking about reforms which have never come about or which did not come about to an adequate degree. As you know, reforms which are announced and discussed but which do not come about are harmful. They create confusion, insecurity and pessimism, irrespective of whether they concern bureaucracy, the insurance system or the pension system. They restrict consumption, they restrict entrepreneurship and they tie Europe down to the low rates of growth which we have today. Be bold, Mr President, my political group will stand by you.

I have picked out a few key points from his speech – which was obviously very general in nature – on which I believe we should focus our attention and our energies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, I think it is clear to everyone that the challenges that Europe has set itself – which we have taken up and will continue to take up – are to a great extent, although not explicitly, contained in the Lisbon project. Nonetheless, we are aware that this week and in the coming months we are dealing with an issue – the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 – on which everything else depends.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your opinion that one cannot have ‘more Europe with less money’. I would also add that one cannot implement the Lisbon strategy without money and one cannot make progress with a cohesion policy, which all the countries are calling for, without having the necessary resources available. I believe cohesion is essential for us, and I would also like to include here the subject of women, a topic which I would always ask you to bear in mind, as it is a factor for strength and innovation which you may find it useful to take forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the opinion that agreement on the Financial Perspective cannot come at any price. Bold choices will also probably be needed to achieve our objectives, and I call on you to take action in that respect. I therefore propose reopening the debate on agricultural funding, on the need to press ahead with the policy on services, and also on the REACH programme, about which all the Member States have reservations and which it would therefore be appropriate to review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed the strategic guidelines this afternoon. Mr President of the Commission, I feel that we might agree with what you have proposed to us, but there is a problem. We have not in fact been able to talk about the 2005 legislative programme because Parliament is not yet familiar with the programme. Along with some of my fellow Members of this House, I was able to get hold of the text at the beginning of the afternoon, but many others were not able to do so. It is absolutely essential that the Members are able to work, in each parliamentary committee, within the framework of your proposal and that we can hold another debate during the next session here in Brussels or in Strasbourg on the 2005 legislative programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the request that I wanted to make on behalf of the group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is important. I should like to remind you that there was an agreement between the previous Commission and Parliament to the effect that the legislative programme should be forwarded to the Members of the House at least ten working days before the debate in plenary, so that they can familiarise themselves with it. This is stipulated in annex 14 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Mr President, I am sure that you will agree that we should have a fresh debate on the 2005 legislative programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> I shall begin by clearing up the point raised by Mrs Grossetête. The arrangement between us is that Parliament is the first to be notified of major decisions taken by the Commission. It was in fact today, this morning, that we adopted the five-year strategic programme and the work programme for 2005, and this is why it only arrived here today – it was only today that we adopted it. Parliament therefore received the work programme for 2005 immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate has certainly not taken the place of another possible debate on the work programme for 2005, which will definitely happen. I feel that Parliament wants the Commission to come here as soon as it adopts its work programmes, which is why we are here today, having adopted both the strategic programme and the work programme for 2005 this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall certainly be more than happy to attend a further debate with specific regard to the work programme for 2005. The main purpose of coming here today was essentially to set out the strategic guidelines for the next five years. As some of the Members of this House have acknowledged, things have been done differently this time: the Commission has decided not to give you a bureaucratic or technocratic programme containing hundreds of pages. Instead, it has decided to make some choices, to present you with the major strategic guidelines and thus to present you with a clear document.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed a partnership to you and Parliament has responded favourably to this partnership. We have proposed priorities to you and it has clearly transpired that the issues that concern the Commission are precisely those that concern Parliament. The conditions are therefore now in place for us, along with the Council, to present our fellow citizens with a programme and a strategic perspective for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I should also like to welcome the presence, for much of this debate, of the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Juncker. As he encouragingly said, there is broad agreement on how to proceed. The Commission, the Council and, of course, Parliament, with the help and support of the Luxembourg Presidency, will therefore, in the next few weeks, seek to achieve interinstitutional coordination, and thus be in a position to make a joint statement on the strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, Mr President, honourable Members, that you can count on the Commission and that, with determination and a sense of responsibility, we can achieve a common project and can consolidate a partnership for a renewed Europe. In so doing, we are pre-empting the spirit of the Constitution. In so doing, we are demonstrating that all three of our institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are capable of setting out a clear vision for the future. I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your support and for your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is clearly the time, however, to translate this strategic programme into practical action. The Members of this House have focused on a point that was also a concern in today’s Commission meeting, and that point is delivery. We wish to concentrate on delivery, on effective implementation, whereby plans do not remain in documents and on paper, but instead the citizens see that something is happening and that we are actually putting those plans into action.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step towards such implementation, the first step towards translating this strategic programme into action – which, I note, has received overwhelming support here today – will be the review of the Lisbon Strategy. We shall be in this House next week to present the so-called Lisbon mid-term review, because the aim is to translate our priorities into action, particularly the priority of prosperity, which, in practical terms, means growth and jobs; growth and jobs as priorities. We have always said, however, that there are many elements of the Lisbon Strategy competing to achieve this objective and some of the Members of this House have noted that there may be problems in relation to certain legislative initiatives. I should like to say to you that these issues will be covered when we present the review of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">You will therefore be able to see that this Commission does what it says and says what it does; that it has the courage to table proposals and the ambition to turn those proposals into action. I should also like to say at this point that I am counting on your support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to answer some of the general questions asked during the debate. First is the question of cohesion. If there is one area in which, frankly, you do not need to argue with us, it is that of cohesion. This Commission does not need any convincing in this area; we understand that cohesion is an essential element of the European model. What we now need is your support so that there is practical support, if possible during the Luxembourg Presidency, for the new financial perspectives. Indeed, we have seen a range of priorities today, as we have seen in previous debates, that can only be implemented if the EU has resources that are commensurate with its ambitions. We have spoken in this House about the transport network for Europe, education and culture, which, again, we shall look at in more detail when we present the Lisbon Strategy, because we consider what we refer to as ‘knowledge for growth’ and ‘knowledge for development’ an essential element of this reviewed strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have also spoken today about cohesion in relation to the weakest regions, those regions that are lagging behind, be they in the new Member States or in the old Member States, be they in the wealthiest countries or in the least-developed countries. The truth is that we must strive to achieve cohesion, because without cohesion there is no solidarity, and without solidarity the very idea of the Union ceases to exist. Consequently, what I ask the Members of this House is that we also do this with our governments – with the governments of the various Member States – to gain support for the concept of solidarity, a concept of genuine cohesion in relation to the least-privileged sections of society and to the regions of our Union that are lagging furthest behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Our model is the European model. I trust that there is no doubt about this. The European model is our model. Nonetheless, we are in a world of globalisation and increased competition, and we have many challenges ahead of us. We must therefore learn from what others do without changing our model.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of research into new technologies, for example, we are behind some of our partners. I am not suggesting that we should replace our model with theirs. I am suggesting that Europe should do more in terms of supporting research into new technologies, whilst maintaining and strengthening the component parts of our model.</p>
<p class="contents">I was therefore very pleased, Mr President, to see that in this House today there has been virtually no theological debate, in the negative sense of the word, about our priority objectives and that it has been possible for us, over the course of this debate, to move closer to a broad consensus, and to demonstrate that economic dynamism and a liberalised and dynamic internal market are not incompatible with justice and social cohesion. We must work simultaneously on both axes – towards both greater liberalisation of the markets and increased social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that if we do achieve the consensus that can be seen here today, this would confirm that we are capable of turning our diversity – and the diversity of opinions in Parliament and in society – into a strength and not a weakness. I am especially pleased to see that a programme that is a programme for change and a partnership that is a partnership for renewal can achieve a broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">On my first visit to Parliament, I promised you, ladies and gentlemen, that I would work in complicity with Parliament. I said this to you, Mr President, and I said it to all of the political forces. The Commission is demonstrating that it keeps its promises. We have heard your concerns during these debates and we are prepared to work within this relationship of positive complicity with Parliament. I therefore wish to congratulate Parliament. I should also like to say that what I want, and what the entire Commission wants, is to work with you and to ask for your support – along with your criticisms when you feel that there is good reason to criticise the Commission – because with your support we can be sure that we will drive forward our partnership for a renewed Europe over the course of the next five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategic statement coincides with the publication of latest Eurostat wealth figures which highlight the poor performance of Scotland compared with other similarly sized European nations. The GDP per capita figures show Scotland trailing behind other small countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">These new EU figures are just the latest to show that the Scottish economy is seriously under-performing. Small countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Finland yet again overtake Scotland in terms of wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures are particularly damning for the government in relation to the north. After EU enlargement, the Highlands and Island are poorer even that parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Eastern Europe is now competing directly with Scotland for jobs and wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Scotland ought not to be so poor. The Irish don't have oil. The Finns don't have a world-class whisky industry. What they do have is the power to take charge of their own wealth. The key element lacking in the Scottish economy is the power to make real decisions – independence is the missing ingredient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
