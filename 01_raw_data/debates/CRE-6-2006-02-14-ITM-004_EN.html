<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights and democracy clause has a long history within Parliament and is based on the assumption that civil and political rights and, in a broader sense, economic, social and cultural rights as well need to be at the heart of European Union policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The clause began in the early 1990s with the Lomé Agreement and in 1990 itself was also applied to Argentina. Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation. Parliament’s requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response. The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries. In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament. It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement. That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause. Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives. In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country. Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited. I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas. To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commission’s external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">A structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights. We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights. It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a further extremely important aspect. This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause. We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Human rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved. All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full. After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries. A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence. Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners. Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous démarches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world. The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries. The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard. EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy. More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Assessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner. The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights. The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues. Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states. I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EU’s human rights policy could be damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement. Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities. This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Parliament’s involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union. Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues. Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically. I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour. That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament. We are in a listening mood, but we would also like to contribute to improving human rights in the world.</p>

Its content has been evolving over time and in accordance with the nature of successive agreements: currently more than 50 with more than 120 countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out. Unfortunately, this has not prevented us from occasionally having to suspend our agreements because of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report that we are debating today, the Committee on Development wishes to stress the following points:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we would state that human rights are universal and indivisible and that human rights, democracy and development are highly interdependent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wish to stress that the fight against poverty is our priority and that we will not be successful without a global approach to processes of democratisation and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we would insist on a twin approach in terms of conditionality: positive discrimination for countries that achieve greater progress and negative discrimination in cases of serious and persistent violations.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement, given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause laid down in Article 96, thereby making it the only agreement that has led to sanctions and that has functioned relatively well.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we would insist that transparency is one of our governing principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we support all measures aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, we welcome the G8’s decision to cancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries on this planet.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, we would appeal for greater commitment from the countries with which we cooperate in the achievement of those Objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighthly, we regret certain Commission decisions with which we do not agree, such as the lifting of sanctions on Sudan, given the serious events in Darfur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, we adopted our opinion, which echoes what Mr Agnoletto was saying, by 20 votes to 1.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, 14 years on from the start of these human rights agreements being included, it is time for a fresh look. Since 1995 the human rights clause has been invoked on 12 occasions. We have invoked it against Niger, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Togo, Haiti – from which I have just returned from an election-observation mission, Comoros, the Ivory Coast, Fiji, Liberia and Zimbabwe. The human rights clause has also prevented the conclusion of agreements with Australia and New Zealand and with Belarus, following the increasingly authoritarian rule of Mr Lukashenko.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the inclusion of the clause and would like it extended to sectoral trade agreements as well. We believe there should be specific benchmarks and possibly a more nuanced set of benchmarks for responding to human rights violations. We ask that the Commission establish a monitoring mechanism that links the implementation and temporary suspension of trade agreements and autonomous trade measures to beneficiary countries’ compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for human and minority rights, as set out in the European Parliament’s annual report on human rights in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the Commissioner’s point that, if our involvement is included in terms of the adoption of the clause in trade and other agreements, it is not formally included in terms of the implementation of the clause. However, we ask the Commission, by its own initiative, to involve the European Parliament more systematically in the assessment of the implementation of the human rights clauses and similar requirements in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important, I think, that Mr Agnoletto refers in his report to the new role which needs to be given to the European Parliament, not only with respect to negotiating agreements with third countries, but also with respect to application and control. This would change significantly the institutional framework within which these agreements are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Agnoletto is right to recommend the extension of the human rights clause to all sectors and to all countries and the precedent which he uses to support this opinion is interesting. Mr Agnoletto is right to call for better control and a better monitoring procedure to establish if the parties are adhering to what they have signed, because often, as you all know, signature is easy, but adherence is hard. Mr Agnoletto is right to mention the need for a mechanism on the application of agreements, among other things. He is right to insist that the human rights dimension should be highly visible in this mechanism. Finally, he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come, at long last, for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that, on other occasions, we criticise through the European process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, as you know, tabled an amendment which, as far as I understand, Mr Agnoletto accepts and, consequently, it supports his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause to which I have just referred has many limitations and lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly. The result is that the clause is often used as an alibi or rhetorical example, without having any real consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are debating today is intended to put an end to this situation, increasing the effectiveness of the clause from a legal point of view. To this end, we Socialists have made several proposals that have been taken up in this report, something about which we are very pleased. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Agnoletto and thank him for his work and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to be under any illusions, though. This initiative report will once again come face to face with reality when we come to applying the clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must promote the introduction of the clause in line with the recommendations of this report, and that is what we are calling for today in this House. We shall continue to need great political will on the part of the Union so that respect for human rights genuinely provides added value in international agreements and in the promotion of dignity and so that the introduction of the clause is not a dead letter and so that it is not used in a hypocritical fashion and only applied when it suits our interests. For this, we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights; an effective, credible and coherent commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">We can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time. Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause, because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements, and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries, in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals, for example, and react accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must maintain a credible position. Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip. We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests. Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion. We must call for an end to the death penalty in India, China, Japan and the United States. We must demand an end to torture wherever it takes place, whether in Guantánamo, in Iraq or in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">In a world obsessed by short-term benefits and security, we cannot lower our guard when it comes to defending our universal rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sajjad Karim, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in May 1995 the Council decided that, to promote fundamental rights and the EU’s democratic ideals, a clause insisting upon human rights observation should be included as an essential element of all bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EU’s agreements. However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of illustration, I make reference to the fact that, despite what we demand on paper, the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests. Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself, the EU-Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage. However, when probed about the EU-Israel Association Agreement, despite Israel’s catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice, as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination, what is the EU’s response?</p>
<p class="contents">I have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House. Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms, such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue. If the Council and the Commission cannot spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently, effectively and transparently, then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements?</p>
<p class="contents">The vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions, nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations. A revised text must provide a concrete, step-by-step implemented mechanism, from dialogue to warning signals, and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension, to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators. Moreover, the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad. If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe, it is that when it comes to human rights, the EU has failed to keep its own house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">The significance of this latest twist in the war on terror cannot be exaggerated, effectively shattering EU complacency about its own human rights record, with enquiries launched by the Council of Europe and this House with warnings that the sanctioning mechanism of Article 7 may be used. It is time for the EU to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review and to connect and balance the external and internal dimensions of its policy on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the EU has struggled to consistently and systematically promote a coherent view of human rights, this Parliament has been praised by NGOs for the positive impact of the revival of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. Under the chairmanship of Mrs Flautre the subcommittee has gone from strength to strength and, coupled with the appointment of Mr Michael Matheson, we have made inroads into the implementation of human rights guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish by saying that as human rights feature more prominently in a range of foreign and security policy domains, and as cross-cutting issues demand more consistent participation, our knowledge and proficiency must be drawn on as joint decision-maker when it comes to initiating consultations and suspending agreements on the basis of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament. This clause does suffer from some deficiencies. First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another. I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact. It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods. In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights. At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated. We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries. That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause. When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue. The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened. I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours. If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions. We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies. That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view it is well-balanced and objective, and above all it gives us an excellent summary not only of what has been achieved in the area of human rights, but also of the important aspects that we must focus on in the future. I should like to mention the following key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I endorse the view that human rights should not be understood only as civil and political rights, but that it is absolutely necessary to focus on economic, social and cultural rights as well, and not only within the context of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals. Secondly, we should draw on the positive experiences that have emerged so far from the Cotonou Agreement, and ensure that clauses on upholding human rights and democratic principles are included in all sectoral agreements or all agreements with developed states, in order to achieve a level playing field for all parties to the Agreement. Thirdly, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on implementing so-called positive measures to motivate states, and to use negative measures only where absolutely necessary, where other options have been exhausted. When weighing up such options it is clearly necessary to consider the impact of the measures on ordinary citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, one of the key factors from the standpoint of ensuring transparency is for the European Parliament and civil society to play a greater role in the implementation of clauses relating to human rights and democratic principles. The work of the Commission and Council has so far had little transparency, and has often been misleading, giving rise to concerns that political, strategic and commercial interests are over-ruling the consistent implementation of clearly defined standards. It is absolutely necessary, if we are to increase transparency and democratisation in decision-making processes, for the European Commission to inform Parliament and interested parties in the public sphere regularly, ideally on an annual basis, about the implementation of clauses dealing with the upholding of human rights and democratic principles, including studies of individual cases and of the approach taken by the Council over a given period, the success of given measures and suggested approaches for the future, in case a situation does not improve. An objective methodology and a clear procedure for implementing the aforementioned clause will of course be essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report wants new criteria which must apply between EU Member States and third countries. Suspension of agreements with those countries would follow if the clause was contravened.</p>
<p class="contents">This report criticises the fact that the clause does not exist in three big areas, namely agriculture, fisheries and textiles. Of course democracy and human rights should be encouraged in all the states of the world which are unfortunate enough not to enjoy them already. All decent democratic states should use their relations with other countries – diplomatic and trading, cultural, etc. – to encourage the growth of democracy and human rights, something that my country, Britain, has done for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this report says that the clause must apply in all countries equally. Has this been properly thought out? If so, it will apply to China and other developing economies in the Far East and other parts of the world. Many jobs depend on trading relations with China and the number will increase in the future. Are we really saying that we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight, just on the basis of one report from the European Parliament? I think not.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the United Nations has called for Guantanámo Bay to be closed and there are many human rights questions hanging over what the Americans are doing in Guantanámo Bay. If this agreement is to apply equally to all countries, are we going to suspend relations with the US if we think that it is contravening human rights in Guantanámo Bay?</p>
<p class="contents">I was also struck by the arrogance of the Commissioner in demanding that other countries, such as China and Japan, abolish the death penalty if they want to have relations with the EU. I think that is an unbelievable intrusion into the democratic and sovereign right of other countries to have a penal system that suits them and their citizens rather than the European Union. The European Union itself is undermining democracy in all its Member States. I know at first hand how democracy in Britain has been undermined by our relationship with the European Union and our increasing political integration into a United States of Europe. So I think perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned. Perhaps it could make a start by paying attention to the results in the Dutch and French referendums on the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that this report is not properly thought out. Yes, we want democracy and human rights in all the countries of the world. But let us try to do it by setting an example in friendship, rather than setting criteria and conditions that will not be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should be flying the flag for human rights at all times and not lowering it in unfavourable circumstances, as unfortunately sometimes happens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about our notorious double standards. We are quite prepared to demand that human rights be respected and to condemn certain countries that fail to do so. However, when it comes to the largest countries or countries that are particularly important in economic terms for businesses in the Member States of the Union, we are just as prepared to remain silent on the subject of human rights or we speak about them in whispers. The curse of these double standards is a stain on the Union’s honour. It is a stain on our fine blue flag with its gold stars.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must also be understood in an economic context. That is why we support the granting of debt relief to developing countries, as Mr Martin mentioned. However, we are also in favour of monitoring the implementation of Union aid to ensure it is not used to prop up dictatorships in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is worth emphasising the need to include clauses on human rights and democracy in the sectoral agreements we enter into concerning agriculture, fisheries and textiles for example. In conclusion, we must always bear in mind that where human rights are concerned, it is never possible to say that everything that should be done has been done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this is an ambitious and serious initiative by the rapporteur. He has produced a report that the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has described as one of the most important reports for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights clauses have been included in EU international or trade agreements for more than 50 years. As the Commissioner has said, they involve over 120 different countries. This report assesses the effectiveness of such human rights clauses as regards implementation and adherence and proposes new ways to strengthen the clause to make it more effective and better monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights clauses have had some success in the past. If the truth be told, however, in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on. Therefore a trade and cooperation relationship develops as a result of an agreement, yet basic and clear breaches of human rights continue; human rights clauses are ignored or not taken seriously, but there are no consequences. This is a regrettable situation; not only is it a missed opportunity for the EU to use its considerable influence better in order to raise human rights standards, it also undermines the credibility of the EU in a key policy area.</p>
<p class="contents">This report goes into a lot of detail about what a new human rights clause could or should look like, how it could be monitored and enforced to make it more effective and what the consequences of breaching the clause might be in different cases. In essence, however, the report aims to do two things. Firstly, to ensure that a new and improved human rights and democracy clause, based on a respect for international law and accepted EU conventions, is included in all new international agreements entered into by the EU. Secondly, a mechanism must be put in place that better monitors adherence to the human rights clause, so that breaches of the clause have a range of real consequences for the overall agreement. This would ensure that human rights are given the kind of political priority the Commissioner has spoken of today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Richard Howitt (PSE). –</span></span>   Mr President, once again over the past year the EU has been accused of failing in its commitment to human rights by refusing to effectively use human rights clauses in trade and cooperation agreements. An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre, but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East, human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt, Israel or Tunisia, in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding.</p>
<p class="contents">With the ACP countries, I acknowledge that so-called Article 96 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years, in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures. However, the EU maintains close relations with Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations. In Eritrea there has been little response to the démarche so far: forced military conscription, arbitrary detention, harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we ensure the success of consultations on the human rights clauses? It needs commitment on the side of the third country. Too much today this seems dependent on how far there is dependence on EU funding. It needs coordination between donors, for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003. It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them, as in the case of Guinea-Bissau, when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue, something that can be blocked and – as was seen today – was sadly lacking in the case of Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States. I do not think she is arrogant; I think she is noble when she upholds the EU’s unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty. I find it breathtaking that the UK Independence Party this morning said that we could turn a blind eye to human rights violations with China simply because we trade effectively with it. I congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur.</p>

<p class="contents">I say that they should be more so because, as has been said, there are many, too many, examples of these principles being toned down, or even over-ridden, in favour of certain particular economic, commercial or political interests. It is true that what is known as the human rights and democracy clause has been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and that this affects 120 countries, but it is also the case that the degree to which it is complied with or the degree to which we demand that it be complied with varies considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">After ten years of applying this system, therefore, we must take stock and take certain corrective measures, and I would therefore congratulate Mr Agnoletto on his work, on his report and on his conclusions, with which we agree, naturally.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to stress that we must remember that many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as those relating to textile products, agriculture and fisheries, do not yet contain such a clause, and that is clearly a deficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although the clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country, full use has not yet been made of its reciprocal dimension and, as Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco has said, I believe that the European Union must begin by offering an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, one of the factors that have compromised its application is the generic nature of its wording, since it does not provide for precise methods for positive or negative intervention in cooperation between the European Union and third countries, leading to the Council’s demands and the national demands of the Member States taking precedence over more general human rights demands.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we support the drawing up of a new text for a model clause to improve the current wording of the so-called Article 2, with a view to guaranteeing a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy in the agreements with third countries.</p>

So be it, but before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in my country, France, as in the rest of the EU, the tyranny of political correctness is becoming completely intolerable. In theory, you can say what you like about mass immigration, but if you oppose it, you are condemned for incitement to racial hatred. If, as happened recently, you mention the islamisation of Alsace, even as an elected representative, you become the target of disgraceful condemnations that only reflect badly on those who made them. In theory, you can say what you like about contemporary history, but, in practice, you can only do that provided you comply with a Communist-inspired law, otherwise you risk being imprisoned. For having contested this law during a political press conference, I myself have lost, at least temporarily, my post at the University of Lyon. If you say you prefer natural families to homosexual partnerships, you risk being condemned once again, as a member of the French parliament from the majority party found out recently. A mayor does not have the right to give a fellow countryman preference over a foreigner when allocating social housing, nor can an individual give this sort of preference in any field. I could give you more examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Every group, every lobby, every minority and every deviancy has developed its own methods of pressurising, intimidating and persecuting the majority, with the active or passive complicity of the authorities. In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, before we impose on our partners a clause that you seem to interpret completely unilaterally, we would do well to start by putting our own house in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall confine myself, for reasons of time, to five of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First question: will the Union continue to confine itself to the more or less declaratory character of the human rights and democracy clause or will it try – and this is my proposal – to raise the democracy principle to an appropriate legal means, into a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the smooth functioning of agreements with third countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Second question: are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible? Is the differentiated intensity in the formulation of the principle in question permissible? The answer is obvious. The credibility of the invocation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must obey the rule of uniform standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Third question: do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic? Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy. It makes the demand of participatory civil rights, of horizontal political accountability. It makes the demand of honest governance, of institutional security and of social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth question: does the Union intend – do we the democratically legitimised Chamber <span class="italic">par excellence </span>intend – to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and, more importantly, of third European countries which are being called on, or will be called on, to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth and last question: in European external relations, the democratic principle and the market economy are cited along side each other or in the same breath, but in practice the market economy claims priority. If nothing else, are we going to restore this balance? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The incorporation of a human rights clause in the agreements of the European Union, since the beginning of the 1990s, has been a politically and institutionally cutting edge. However, in taking stock today, we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive. This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, as the Commissioner so honestly and boldly said, to selective sensitivity to the application of the clause, to the prevalence of double standards and, finally, to the supremacy of national interests and expediencies over the common and decisive stand of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Τhere are numerous examples and this situation is creating a serious problem of credibility of the European institutions among European citizens. On the one hand, the European Union can freeze relations and agreements – Mr Ford spoke and gave examples – and, on the other hand, it does nothing about infringements of human rights in Tunisia, Egypt, Israel or Turkey. Strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort. The European Union will not be able to engage in a dynamic foreign policy with the unanimity procedure. This dimension needs to be retabled in the debate on the future of Europe. I agree with all the proposals made by my honourable friend, Mr Agnoletto. However, we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision, behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities. Otherwise, however strong the clauses are, they will, unfortunately, remain inactive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evident from the responses to it that it enjoys very widespread approval. We have already heard from various quarters how much easier we find it to criticise small states such as Myanmar and impose sanctions on them to do the same with large ones, where economic interests come into play. This is where we have a problem, a dilemma, and it is one that we should address frankly instead of beating about the bush. The European Union has a credibility problem, a problem with double standards, and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations. We very much agree with many of the points made in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, though, that we will be addressing a similar issue – that of the Fundamental Rights Agency – in a forthcoming debate in this House. That Agency will deal with many of the issues with which we are concerning ourselves today. I would like to raise Members’ awareness of the fact that we will be able to use this Fundamental Rights Agency not only to improve the protection of human rights within the European Union’s Member States, but also as a sort of early warning system to inform us what is going on in the states around us and how things stand as regards human rights in them. This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europe’s policy on human rights. This House will be taking a decision on this very soon, and I ask you all to support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, it has to be noted that this clause is very rarely invoked: only 12 times since 1995. If we compare this with the number of non-democratic states with which the European Union concludes treaties, the clause must, in most cases, be regarded as redundant for all practical purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the Member States’ immigration and asylum policies, which the rapporteur wishes to bracket together with the human rights clause. That strikes me as not very realistic and in any case not very desirable, certainly when developing countries would be invited to criticise the reception of their own nationals who apply for asylum in Europe. We should, in fact, make a point of encouraging such states to take back those of their nationals who do not qualify for political asylum over here. Often, though, experience has shown that the exact opposite is true.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is undesirable to involve non-governmental organisations in the assessment of the application of the human rights clause with regard to third countries. Such organisations have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever, and should not be given political responsibility of this kind. If anything, Europe should be able to give more account of what happens with taxpayers’ money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, their efforts to further their own interests often prevent the Union from taking effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">The task before us today is to ensure that human rights clauses are introduced in a way that will make it possible for us to exert effective pressure on third countries. It is no longer enough to simply make a statement of principles and requirements. They need to be implemented, and that calls for a great deal of courage and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been saddened to note that the behaviour of the Union’s leaders tends to be governed by fear and opportunism. All too often economic and political interests outweigh the need for a swift response to notorious cases where individuals are humiliated and their freedom restricted. The principle of solidarity must not be treated as if it were a ballast to be jettisoned at any time. It needs to become a crucial instrument of the European Union’s policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights clauses must therefore be equipped with appropriate means of persuasion and of exerting political pressure. That, in turn, requires a change in the approach to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. A permanent feature of this policy should be an ongoing struggle to defend the principles of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need European institutions modelled on American government-funded foundations and which are able to effectively support human rights defenders the world over. No such institutions exist at present, but the planned EU Fundamental Rights Agency should help to fill this gap. Indeed, the Human Rights Agency would be a more appropriate title for this body.</p>
<p class="contents">In its annual report, the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch concluded that during 2005 the European Union’s main interests had been in the fields of business, politics and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mere verbal criticism of totalitarian and dictatorial regimes is no longer enough. The European Union must demonstrate the will to implement fundamental rights the world over. Is there anyone in the European Union currently dealing with the restrictions on freedom of expression and the activities of non-governmental organisations in Russia? Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities? Will we eventually be able to bring ourselves to stand up to the Cuban regime?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to express my support for the protest action against the <span class="italic">Google</span> search engine. I do not intend to use it today. <span class="italic">Google</span> has set up a special version of its search engine for Chinese pages, controlled by the Chinese Government. This is a way of censoring material that runs counter to the official Chinese line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human rights policy of the European Community and indeed of the wider international community played an important part in the fall of the undemocratic regimes in Southern Europe in the 1970s and in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989. At present, human rights and democracy form the axis around which the European Union’s external and security policy is being constructed. The Union’s foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries. The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid. Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development. General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">A good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis. It would also be desirable to set up a mechanism for consultation with non-governmental organisations. Election monitoring missions play a vital part in protecting and supporting human rights and democracy beyond the Union’s borders, as does the aid the Union should provide to civil society in third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Economic development, social peace and a growing economy are clearly related to democracy and human rights. Cooperation for development can only be assured in the context of democratic societies. If we analyse the efficacy of our cooperation for development, we will confirm that in those countries where democracy and respect for human rights are improved, everything works better. In cases of dictatorships, non-transparent regimes or corrupted governments, our work can be completely distorted.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that we must fully understand democracy and human rights. Democracy means respect for diversity; human rights are not complete without respect for diversity, plurality and cultural differences. We have seen how minorities in countries close to joining the European Union rely on us in order to achieve this respect for their rights. A chance for plurality and respect for cultural and national rights can come from the European institutions, irrespective of the fact that many European countries do not respect it. We have to enhance the role of our Parliament, because it is the house of our European representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the report it seems as if a magnifying glass is being held over the principle of clarity and transparency. Various interpretations of the concept of ‘human rights’ prevent the European Union from taking appropriate actions when there are gross violations. When the Council is debating the human rights situation in a state where there is cause for concern, usually one EU country or another insists on acting in its own national interest and vetoes the decision. The unanimity principle ought to be made more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">When debating the possibility of sanctions, inevitably the political and economic power of the target country, along with its size and the likelihood of retaliation, is considered. Such a state of affairs should be avoided where possible and certain states, which blatantly violate human rights, should not feel more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions instrument, directed against one regime or another or a government, which has behaved inappropriately, must be employed with extreme precision. The stick of sanctions should not hit people, who often live in particularly harsh conditions and do not have the opportunity to oppose the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few months the EU will begin negotiations with a state, which still has difficulty applying policies of gender equality and women's rights; a state, which has yet to rid itself of the shackles of ethnic discrimination. Human rights will form an important part of these negotiations, so the procedure for defining this negotiation process should also be more transparent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements constitutes one of the instruments of this policy. The clause, as has already been stated, has so far been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and applies to more than 120 countries. Despite the frequent positive experiences, however, I feel it is necessary to consider how we might improve or perfect the clause.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Agnoletto report provides many important and interesting suggestions. It points out, for example, that the concept of human and civil rights and freedoms also includes economic, social and cultural rights. It also emphasises that the EU, in its support for human rights, should focus on implementing policies in the area of gender equality and women’s rights and should oppose any form of discrimination on the grounds, for example, of sexual orientation, or of the rights of disabled people. I should like to lend my support to the idea that the European Parliament should play a greater role in the preparation process for implementing and assessing the democracy clause, and I should like to add that both civil society and the international network of non-governmental organisations involved in human rights should play a much greater role in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be pointed out that there has always been a discussion as to whether human rights can be administered internally by the State or government or whether they are universal. It is clear beyond doubt that human rights are universal rights and that no dictator or State is entitled to deny human beings the smallest aspect of their fundamental rights. The problem is that of how Europe is to make use of its resources to try to export these noble aims. In this area, we sometimes criticise Europe for not employing its rights and its power, including economic power, and, at the same time, we criticise the administration or the institutions for closing their eyes to certain shortcomings. There is a decision to be made. We have to decide whether it is by using persuasion or economic power that Europe can best export its aims. I would conclude by saying that we have to give our institutions all the resources to ensure that our values are made sufficiently coherent to be exported by the Community.

I especially welcome the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in all agreements with third countries. It is regrettable that the implementation of the human rights clause has until now been contingent on geo-political and geo-economic considerations which have nothing to do with the Union as a whole, but which often depend on the narrow strategies of some Member States and some Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">The most glaring example of the lack of substantive implementation of this clause is Ethiopia, despite the fact that Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission and the Council to open consultations, under the terms of Article 96, following the massacres and serious violations of human rights that took place in the wake of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I am appalled by the Council’s silence and inaction on this matter. Only the Commission and one Member State – the United Kingdom – have suspended direct aid to the budget of the Ethiopian Government, the minimum they could do in the circumstances. Given, however, that they did not clarify the terms and conditions, this had no impact whatsoever on the Ethiopian Government, and sent out a disastrous message not only to the Ethiopian people as a whole, but also to all Africans – the headquarters of the Organisation for African Unity is in the Ethiopian capital – as well as to the EU Member States and to all countries with which the EU maintains relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us not forget that human rights issues are already being raised systematically with partners in political dialogues. We have established dedicated human rights dialogue and consultations with certain countries, and human rights subcommittees have also been established. In other cases, human rights may be raised at association councils and at association committee meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the human rights clause is not simply to make it possible to impose sanctions, but also to create a basis for human rights dialogue and for the setting-up of institutions concerned with it, because we need to give such institutions a chance and encourage them to develop. Institution building is as important as the clause, and the existence of the human rights clause in the association agreement, or in partnership and cooperation agreements, creates the basis for this. Therefore there is no need to replicate this in sectoral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to recall that our agreements have a wide range of policy goals. We want to contribute to stability and to the increase of welfare for all the populations concerned. It is not a lack of courage if we do not always have the same human rights clause or if we do not apply sanctions. We also have to contribute to the development of a population – look at the African, and some Asian, populations, as some of you mentioned. There is also freedom from want and freedom from fear, which are closely related to human rights and to the human security concept. That means we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are many other clauses to defend, such as the clause against terrorism, the clause against weapons of mass destruction and the clause for democracy. It is all interlinked and we cannot focus only on human rights; we have to see the whole picture, which includes poverty eradication. This is the difficult balance that we have to strike sometimes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to harmonise this clause, because we are negotiating with every partner and we have to find solutions in the end. Not every partner accepts exactly the same wording. However, it is not so much about wording but about application and the way we can encourage the partners to come up with their own solutions, because, as we have always made clear, we do not want to impose everything on the others: we want to encourage their societies to build and to change.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, institution building is just as important, as are legal, judicial and police reform, because that is where human rights are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that, with all due respect, in many individual cases we have been able to get people out of prison and to talk about them. We speak about the death penalty with each and every partner, we speak against torture, and slowly these things come through. Maybe sometimes the issue is speed – not everything is being done at the same time. But let us be realistic: we cannot change the world in a day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
