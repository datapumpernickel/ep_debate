Let me begin by taking this opportunity to inform you of another decision which the Commission took today. The Commission today decided to appoint Mr Carlo Trojan Head of Delegation in Geneva as of 1 September this year and Mr O’Sullivan Secretary-General as of 1 June this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Levi, formerly Spokesman for the Commission, has been appointed Director of the Forward Studies Unit. Mr Jonathan Faull, formerly Head of the Press and Communications Service, will henceforth – and for a transitional period – act as the Commission Spokesman. All these staffing decisions were taken as part of the reform of the Commission and I think they were the right decisions in the context of the further reform measures that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thanked Mr Carlo Trojan sincerely for his activities. May I add, speaking also as a former Berlin politician, that I too want to thank Mr Carlo Trojan most sincerely for the great commitment he demonstrated during the process of German unification. Let me make it quite clear here that it was partly thanks to this commitment that the European Parliament and the Commission immediately rendered so much assistance to East Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I will now turn to the Commission’s decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective. That decision was necessary to secure financing for the new political priority, the new highly political task of providing assistance to the Western Balkans region. Many of this Parliament’s resolutions have emphasised how important the European Union’s commitment to the Western Balkans is to the future success of the EU’s foreign policy, and the Council has also constantly stressed its importance at various summits. That is why now is the time to safeguard this task from the financial viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">In the financial perspective, the financial plan for the European Union, which the Council decided on in Berlin in March 1999, the effects on the Balkans were not anticipated. Let me remind you that the Berlin decision on Agenda 2000 was taken on exactly the same day as the outbreak of war in Kosovo. When Parliament, jointly with the Council and the Commission, adopted the interinstitutional agreement on Agenda 2000, the following statement was annexed to it at Parliament’s instigation: “In view of the development in the Balkan situation, particularly in Kosovo, the two arms of the budgetary authority request that the Commission, when needs have been ascertained and estimated, submit the necessary budget proposals, including, if appropriate, a proposal for a revision of the financial perspective”. </p>
<p class="contents">On 16 December last year, at the time of the decision on the 2000 budget, the budgetary authority once again called upon the Commission to submit a multiannual financial plan for a programme of assistance for the Western Balkans and, if necessary, depending on the amount required, to submit concurrently a proposal on the review of the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions the Commission has taken today are a response to the requests made by Parliament and the Council. The starting point for the Commission’s proposal is the following question: what resources will be required for the programme period – i.e. up to 2006 – to meet the substantial financial assistance needs of the Western Balkans? By the Western Balkans I mean Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo, and also the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to submit an integrated aid programme, while each country’s participation in that programme will be conditional upon compliance with certain criteria concerning the development of democracy in the region, the rule of law and the will to cooperate. The programme the Commission is proposing forms part of the stabilisation and association process and is designed to make financing available for the reconstruction and stabilisation of the region, for the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, the development of a market economy and the development of cooperation between the recipient countries themselves and also between them and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now give you a few figures, for whenever we discuss the budget we must, of course, quote actual figures. According to the Commission’s estimates, the financial requirement for Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and also Montenegro up to the year 2006 will be EUR 1.5 billion, i.e. around EUR 200-230 million per year. Late last year, we received a very precise study from the World Bank and the Commission regarding the financial requirements for reconstruction in Kosovo, a study which showed that, over the next three to four years, the financial assistance required will total USD 2.3 billion, and the Commission, i.e. the European Union, agreed to fund half that requirement from the EU budget, in other words approximately EUR 1.1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out, the Commission proposal focuses particularly on the need for the regions to cooperate with one other, which is why special funding is to be provided to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal also makes provision for including financial aid for Serbia to the tune of EUR 2.3 billion in the financial plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard it is clear, of course, that these EU budget resources can, and must, only be allocated if there are signs of progress towards democracy in Serbia. The Commission is convinced, however, that if we decide the financial framework at this stage, that will send an important political message to Serbia. It will make it clear that it is not just a question of making promises to the Serbian forces of opposition, but that preparations are also being made to provide immediate assistance on the ground once the necessary changes are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amounts involved, let me tell you the following: the Commission estimates the total requirement for the region at EUR 5.5 billion from the EU budget. The financial plan in Agenda 2000, which was adopted in Berlin, already includes some EUR 1.8 billion; these resources were earmarked for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, the Commission decided to propose reallocating a further EUR 1.4 billion of aid from other foreign policy budget lines to the Balkans. It therefore proposed and decided to reprogramme the budget for external actions, as I will describe in more detail in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The view of the Commission is that we will have to raise the external action ceiling here for the next few years by EUR 300 billion a year. In this connection, the Commission made the following proposal on financing this additional requirement: in the years 2001 and 2002, these resources should be taken from resources previously earmarked for agricultural policy and reallocated to the external action heading.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in Parliament. At this point let me repeat that this measure does not mean undoing the agricultural policy package decided in Berlin. And it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers. Let me point out that, overall, the agriculture budget totals EUR 44 billion, which makes it clear that reallocating EUR 300 million has no impact on the overall agricultural package. This amount will have to be financed in the year 2001, among others, from the savings resulting from the euro-dollar exchange rate. After all, the current exchange rate value of the euro means very substantial savings for the European budget with regard to export financing.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2003 onwards, the Commission proposes that the decision on financing the necessary resources should be taken in conjunction with the already scheduled mid-term review of agricultural policy. Let me point out that the Commission is also proposing to the budgetary authority that the external action appropriations should only be increased once resources for Serbia can indeed be allocated. This is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred, let me summarise the situation as follows: the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region. We did not propose any cuts in programmes aimed specifically at combating poverty in the world and the proposals also took into account whether some programmes were not fully taken up in the past, i.e. the administrative activities and the relevant administration’s implementation of these programmes in the areas concerned were examined.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the TACIS programme for the countries of the former Soviet Union. But let me point out that, in relation to the Mediterranean region, the Commission proposal provides that in this coming period – i.e. up to 2006 – the resources available for the MEDA programme will be increased overall by 13% compared with the previous period. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by pointing out the following: there is another point where the decision on the revision of the financial perspective also responds to a request by Parliament. In connection with the 2000 Budget, you proposed that, in future, the appropriations allocated for Cyprus and Malta should no longer appear under the external action heading but be reclassified under the pre-accession aid budget, so as to make it clear that we have a coherent plan here; that these are appropriations that will be spent with a view to the desired accession of Cyprus and Malta to the European Union. I think that will make the financial planning even more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In many regards, today’s Commission decisions satisfy some of Parliament’s key requests; we have complied with these requests. That is why I ask you to support the Commission proposal on the review of the financial perspective and hope you will do precisely that!</p>

There were not a great many surprises in it and, to some extent, I welcome that. A question remains, however, in relation to redeployment in Category 4. I heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines. You mentioned lines where there was not complete take-up and that there would be cuts in TACIS. Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions? Last year, the Council proposed a 10% across-the-board cut in Category 4. Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4? I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003. If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years, where do you expect that money to come from in 2003? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would regard that as the wrong approach. We have enough criteria according to which we can carefully assess to what extent we need to shift appropriations compared with Agenda 2000. So these proposals are entirely justified and no across-the-board cuts are being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">On your second question: the Commission is proposing to shift appropriations from agricultural policy to foreign policy for the years 2001 and 2002. Let me repeat that this is simply a question of limiting the increase in foreign policy appropriations, i.e. not of cuts to the budget available today. The Commission’s proposal for the years from 2003 is as follows: we are looking to increase the amount for foreign policy, which, in arithmetical terms, would, of course, mean raising the overall ceiling. But the Commission is proposing that both arms of the budgetary authority should try to make savings in particular areas during the annual budgetary procedure in order to find these 300 million. It could also be that in connection with the mid-term review of Category 1, scheduled for the year 2003, it will be proposed that these additional appropriations be financed over the entire period.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress once again that, in my view, we can finance this increase in foreign policy resources within the overall ceiling decided in Berlin and that the appropriations for Serbia should only be disbursed once we see real democratic developments there.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that we would have preferred to be presented with a written text, but it appears that these ideas have been the subject of internal debates within the Commission and that we will therefore be given a more specific text to study at our leisure. Having said that, I fail to see your grounds for considering that agricultural expenditure is not going to be used in its entirety, as it should, nor how you could release sums, that you describe as minimal, for the heading covering international actions and foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last financial year, we instead felt palpable tension regarding market expenditure and I do not understand what intellectual grounds you have for considering that too much money is being allocated to agriculture, apart from the fact that you need money for the foreign policy heading.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the same applies to the cuts under heading 4. You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity. Fine, I can accept that, but what gives you the right – you spoke of very specific criteria, so tell us what they are – what gives you the right to think that too much money has been earmarked for other parts of the world, apart from the fact that you need that money for Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a genuine problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude with my third question. I should like to know whether, in the undertakings concerning aid that we gave at the donor conference, we made commitments in US dollars or in euros? Given the state of the euro, I should like to know, if it was in US dollars, how you are dealing with the resulting situation and how you plan to guarantee that there will be strict parallelism between the donations made by the European Union and those made by other donors within the international community? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the 2000 budget discussions. In its proposal the Commission has now allocated EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2000-2006. It is not therefore charging appropriations already disbursed for Kosovo in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your comment that you need a written document in order to analyse the proposal: you will find the proposal on the financial perspective and re-programming on the Internet tomorrow. The Commission will decide on the CARDS programme next week, because here there were still some questions that required clarification from the legal service. The key figures will therefore be available to you as from tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure, let me point out the following: this year, given the fluctuations in the exchange rates, we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less, assuming a parity euro-dollar rate. You are also aware that the Commission will have to make proposals again next year on various organisations of the market, especially the sugar market, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, has stated that he will make a proposal in this regard, which will lead to savings of EUR 300 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am not saying that there is too much money floating around; as Commissioner for the budget I am aware that money is always scarce, but money is also scarce for those who have to finance the European budget. That is why, in my opinion, the Commission had to propose financing a new priority, without asking for new money, but rather by examining the possibilities of redeployment within the budget and making the appropriate proposal. And that is what it has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you. You say there was an increase in the agricultural sector and that this increase would be curtailed. The fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in Berlin. In fact, these appropriations are urgently needed! I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas. That is why I now ask you: do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas? We need substantial funds there, because enlargement, with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries, will generate enormous problems in these rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture. I would ask the Commissioner how this Commission proposal fits in with the decision of Parliament on next year’s guidelines that agriculture could not be the primary source of financing, as it appears that more would be taken out of agriculture than found, for example, by means of reallocation. On the other hand, I would ask whether the Commission believes it would again be possible to use the flexibility instrument for this financing measure, since the rules forbid the use of the flexibility instrument more than once?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me perhaps give you a few very rough figures once again: we estimate the need at EUR 5.5 billion and, overall, 3.3 billion of that will come from the external action heading. So it is quite clear that the redeployment here is concentrated on foreign policy. In practice, the Commission proposal means redeploying EUR 600 million from agriculture policy for the years 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the use of the flexibility reserve. The interinstitutional agreement provides that the flexibility reserve can only ever be used for a given purpose for one year, i.e. cannot be used on a continuous basis for a long-term measure. The Commission proposes that, for the time being, only the EUR 40 million that are also available in the budget this year should be allocated to Serbia for the year 2001, for example, to finance the Energy for Democracy programme. In the event of a political change in Serbia during 2001, we could also resort to the flexibility reserve.</p>

<p class="contents">This is neither the time nor the place for me to criticise this government, but I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission took into account the fact that neighbouring countries, as well as the Serbian civilian population, were being penalised when it decided to defer appropriations on purely political grounds. Without direct appropriations and aid, how does it intend to resolve the issues of industrial pollution, the navigability of the Danube and the Danube’s bridges destroyed by American bombing, which drastically reduced the river traffic of as many as five neighbouring countries? What contribution is the Commission going to make – not in three years’ time but in the next few months – to resolving the issue of the vast amount of pollution caused by the bombing of the Pancevo petrochemical plant, which contaminated huge areas, seeds and harvests with poisonous gases and which, according to the latest United Nations report, even polluted the water tables with dioxins, mercury and other toxic substances? </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any chance, any prospect of taking direct, immediate action on Serbian territory as well, in the interests, and I stress this point, of the neighbouring countries and regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the proposal on the review of the financial perspective specifically earmarks approximately EUR 80-90 million for cooperation projects. Secondly, as I pointed out, we have allocated EUR 40 million for aid to Serbia in this year’s budget as well, but these funds will only be used in a targeted manner in areas where the democratic opposition forces are currently endeavouring to establish a democratic system and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s budget includes EUR 540 million for the region as a whole. At the donor conference on the Stability Pact, Mr Patten approved certain projects and made it clear that the Commission can provide practical measures of assistance on the ground. These EUR 540 million are available in the budget, thanks largely to the very strong support of the European Parliament and its endeavour to genuinely allocate adequate resources to this task. In this connection, let me once again thank the European Parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated? When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms, when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market, then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them, that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly! Or must we always and, on principle, begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics?
