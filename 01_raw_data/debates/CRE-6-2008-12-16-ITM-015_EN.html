This report was the first to be finished, exactly two weeks ago, and strangely enough it is the last to be debated.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all and quite sincerely I must thank everyone who has worked on this report, particularly the delegation, among many, from the French Presidency. I too would like to mention Mr Léglise-Costa, who led this initiative with great professionalism. Together we have found an intelligent solution to the issue, at perhaps the most difficult time imaginable, that is to say when the motor industry is in the throes of an appalling crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">On close examination, this result was by no means a foregone conclusion, not least considering how this report’s journey began, with all the controversy when the Commission adopted the corresponding proposal last December. Yet we have succeeded not only in seeing it through, but also in achieving three things at once: we have stepped up our efforts, enhanced our strategy and introduced greater flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I say we have stepped up our efforts because, as you know, the priority proposed by Parliament has been agreed; that is to say, a long-term reduction target has been included, of 95 grams of CO<span class="sub">2</span> per kilometre by 2020. This is obviously important because it brings this sector into line with others covered by other legislative instruments such as the emissions trading scheme, but also, and above all, because it allows companies to plan their investment, innovation and research accordingly, which I believe is crucial at this difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I say we have enhanced our strategy for the reasons that Mrs Corbey explained a short while ago: we have in fact helped to shape the future by encouraging eco-innovations and subjecting them to rigorous controls; we have encouraged research into new engines, or new fuels, shall we say; and we have introduced a system of super credits for vehicles with exceptionally low emissions. This opens up a strategic outlook that will, of course, hinge on the review in 2015 of the testing systems used to produce accurate and credible measurements of how much the various technologies help to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have introduced greater flexibility, as I said, because, as we have managed to strengthen the regulation, it has been possible, reasonable and fair to allow businesses to take a gradual approach, phasing in the new measures between 2012 and 2015. At the same time, as you will be aware, we have reformulated the procedures in such a way that they still enable us to persuade companies to make investments that will put them in a position to meet their own specific reduction targets, while at the same time facilitating their transition to the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say again how pleased I am with this proposal; it is, I believe, a great work of industrial policy. It is shame that we do not have the power or all the tools we need to be able to intervene with other instruments or other levers, and I hope that under the Commission’s coordination all the Member States will adopt intelligent policies to encourage demand, using forms of eco-taxation, for instance, as the French Government has done for its part, in order to prevent any distortion of competition. This would be an extremely useful additional measure in terms of replacing existing, obsolete vehicles, while permitting more efficient cars to be placed on the market on a large scale.</p>

<p class="contents">Moreover, we are dealing with something that is basically quite emblematic of our urban ways, the way we move around, our way of life, our industry, our society. It was therefore an impossible bet on a subject, moreover, in which there are many consumer countries and few producers, in reality. It was therefore very complex.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had already initially done this very difficult task, as far as possible. The rapporteur and Parliament have adjusted the realm of possibility and I believe that, with the prospect of the 95 grams, the details of which will be re-established in 2013, but which have now been clearly set out, manufacturers now have visibility and are going to be able to integrate technology in order to get there by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently not sure what the emissions are from the existing stock. We only know about the stock that has been sold, which is not far off 160 grams. The target is 95 grams, and the current stock is probably at more than 200 grams. This is the extent of the challenge. It is really a very spectacular step forward. I do not know what the Commission will say now, but insofar as it has conducted this project from the start with so much intelligence, expertise and finesse, I have no doubt that all of this will end in a consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is an important tool in helping the Member States to achieve their emission targets within the framework of the proposal on effort sharing between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise agreement achieved introduces a series of changes to the Commission’s proposal. They include the gradual adoption of targets between 2012 and 2015, lower fines for the first 3 grams by which manufacturers exceed their targets up to 2018 and, finally, the provision for taking account of eco-innovations, which are disregarded today when measuring emissions during test cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments could also be seen as a watering down of the Commission’s proposal. The proposal for a compromise on a long-term basis, by setting a long-term target for emissions from all new cars in the order of 95 grams per kilometre by 2020, offsets these losses. By incorporating the target in question, the legislation will achieve approximately one-third of the reductions needed in the sectors outside the emissions trading scheme, which is approximately what we had initially calculated for 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise agreement achieved benefits both the environment and consumers, who will save money from lower fuel bills. It will also provide stability in investments, allow manufacturers to predict movements, strengthen innovation and result in greater investment in research and development. Thus it will offer manufacturers the advantage of the initiative to move on global markets, where the demand for ecological cars is expected to increase, and by extension it will improve the competitiveness of the automotive industry in Europe. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guido Sacconi, for the important contribution which he made in achieving the agreement and I trust that you will support the compromise agreement in the vote tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He headed a good and fair negotiation and I think that the result can be seen for itself. The outcome of the negotiations in the trialogue reflects some of the basic points demanded by the Committee on Industry. We demanded ambitious targets for 2020, we demanded a slow phasing in, we want a fair distribution of the burden, and we want ecological innovations; the recognition of eco-innovations also had a broad majority. We want to treat niche vehicles and small series separately and the only point which is still under discussion is the size of fines.

It has been a pleasure to work with him. One of these days I may even learn Italian and be able to communicate with him properly, though he is leaving Parliament next year. He has done a fantastic job on this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s car industry is particularly significant. It is very important in many ways: millions of people in Europe depend for their jobs and their livelihood on this very important and in some respects cutting-edge industry. It certainly accounts for a major proportion of our manufacturing export outlet. Through various measures we have succeeded in exporting much of the rest of our manufacturing capacity outside Europe. We have to be very careful that we do not do the same with the car industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I thought the original Commission proposal was too draconian and placed too many burdens on the car industry, and large parts of it were probably unachievable without major change within industry.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have now arrived at a very good and acceptable compromise. It was important that instead of always wielding the big stick we left some space for carrots. I think we have done that now: we have put in incentives for the manufacturers to develop cleaner and greener technology rather than threatening them all the time with swingeing penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never forget the important role that the Member States will need to play in this, in terms of adjusting their tax systems to make the incentives for buying cleaner and greener cars much more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good proposal now, and my group will support it in the vote tomorrow. I thank Guido Sacconi once again for his work. I think that, after much negotiation, much argument and much debate, we have reached an acceptable compromise, and I pay tribute to the French presidency for that. Albeit, I think the whole first-reading process is severely flawed, and I hope we do not adopt this for future legislative acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, this industrial situation requires several ingredients: the financial capacity of the Union to invest, to create a real European adjustment fund for a non-carbon economy, in particular in the vehicle research sector, and to bring together the employees of the sectors concerned through the creation of a consultative committee on climate change, in order to give direction to the social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The crises and the demands of the fight against climate change mean that we urgently need to generate new industrial policies based on this capacity to anticipate, to manage the social dialogue and to develop employment. ‘A wise man cures ambition with ambition itself’.</p>

That is why this chapter had to be closed now, so that the automotive industry can focus on the crisis plaguing it and will not need to keep battling with what figures it must or can achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We need security of planning and this package gives us security of planning. It is a now-or-never package. It is a now-or-never decision, because if we do not get it through now, if we were to go now to second reading, then we would not get an automotive regulation. For this reason and because it is a special omen, I should like to congratulate Guido Sacconi.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not easy, when he took over as rapporteur for this difficult part, to strike a balance here. He has managed to do so. I have to say, I have the highest respect for your work, because you have managed in this report to create incentives for industry but, at the same time, to introduce fines which, as Werner Langen said, are perhaps a little high, but which achieve a paradigm shift, which is precisely what we need here.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot keep pummelling away at the automotive industry by saying you have not achieved your own targets.

He tabled a very reasonable proposal. It is a shame that Environment Minister Borloo did not give Mr Dimas strong support against the diehard reactionary Heads of State from Germany and especially Italy. It was Mr Berlusconi and Mrs Merkel who made sure that we now have a directive which will result in 2012, when the rules in this directive have been exhausted, in higher average emissions from the new European car fleet than we have today. Whatever happened to ambition?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Langen, I asked you last time to bring me proof that you are capable of this sort of basic calculation. I, at any rate, come on balance to the conclusion that this directive will not exert any pressure to innovate because, apart from the unambitious regulation of limit values, it recognises no penalty mechanism and because the limit value for 2020 was not made compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">The current crisis in the automotive industry in Europe was caused by the automotive industry itself. It slept through and sat out decades of pressure to innovate. It failed to respond to the need to protect the climate or to the demands of the energy crisis and we are again passing up an opportunity to ensure there is constructive pressure here until well into the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless agreement is reached tomorrow on a binding long-term target, my group will be unable to vote for this directive. I am sorry, Mr Dimas, that it should be so. We must make an example of this directive. We must ask ourselves if Europeans really are serious in their ambitions to protect the climate, if they are not more daring with their gas-guzzling cars and cars as status symbols than we are in this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report on the reduction of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from light vehicles has added an important detail: the fight against climate change. For the first time, in fact, we have regulated CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from passenger vehicles by imposing an ambitious and binding long-term target of 95 grams of CO<span class="sub">2</span> per kilometre by 2020, at a time when the serious financial crisis and the subsidies given to the motor industry in non-EU countries are, together, severely testing our own industry. We have successfully fought to include a reduction in the penalties for slight deviations from the set targets.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the method the Commission has chosen to determine the reduction targets, based on the kerb weight of the average car, is questionable and unjustified from an environmental point of view. Indeed, a provision of this kind leads to a paradoxical situation in which vehicles that are lighter and smaller, and therefore less polluting, are in fact penalised. Nonetheless I believe and hope that, once appropriately balanced, the text will be able to give great impetus to a targeted effort. For these reasons I see the report on the reduction of vehicle CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions as a significant result and I am therefore in favour of its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fines are so low that it is cheaper to ignore the law than to convert their production. What will become of Parliament’s requirement of 95 g per kilometre by 2020? Nothing!</p>
<p class="contents">Vote for Amendment 50 put forward by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Then we will have a truly binding emissions requirement for cars: 95 g of carbon dioxide by 2020. If this is adopted, we in the GUE/NGL Group are prepared to support this. Otherwise, we are not.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that if two company managers are shut in a room they will immediately start to discuss how they can divide up the market between them and form a cartel. Unfortunately, this also applies to the two large political groups in this Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Once again the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group have chosen to ride roughshod over the rest of us. Who are the big losers in all this? Well, they are the environment and social democracy. For the environment, this is a lost opportunity to take control of the emissions from cars. As regards the Socialist Group, this agreement demonstrates that they are increasingly starting to resemble their environmentally unfriendly political opponents in the PPE-DE Group. It does not bode well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to these agreements, a considerable reduction in emissions should have been achieved by now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is very little evidence of this in practice, however. The average CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from a car today are not that different from those of 10 years ago. That is why we must impose strict, binding rules. A strong industry lobby, however, has significantly weakened the original Commission proposal, which I regret.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been included, though, is a long-term goal of 95 g/km by 2020, which I am pleased about, but it depends on the interpretation to what extent this has been included effectively in the current text. Moreover, the short-term agreements have been watered down, which is partly attributable to a phase-in for both volume and penalties, as a result of which fewer efforts are made.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I am unable to support the present agreement reached between the Council and Parliament, and I regret that the Commission proposal came to nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their concerted efforts have enabled us to finalise all of these climate dossiers and this one in particular regarding the automobile sector which, as many have said, raised concerns due to the current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the speakers today have said that these are ambitious targets, from the initial ones for 2012 to the final ones for 2020, and that it was a wise decision to choose this single timeframe, which also applies to other reports that we will be adopting over the next few days. I also agree with the decision to introduce the modulated penalty system gradually, and the possibility of taking into account reductions achieved through the use of eco-innovations. All of these things stemmed from the trialogue among the institutions and, in my opinion, have enabled us to find solutions that lower the economic cost for manufacturers at this sensitive time, without affecting the general targets. An example of this is the introduction of super credits for cars emitting less than 50 g of CO<span class="sub">2</span> per kilometre.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I too would like to point out that, in all likelihood, the approach taken whereby the limit value of emissions will increase in line with vehicle weight will mean that smaller vehicles will not obey the general rule that ‘he who pollutes the most, pays the most’. We are nonetheless pleased with the outcome and are happy to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk about loopholes in the legislation. These are not loopholes. These are absolute motorways with emergency exits for the car industry, which avoids any responsibility and any requirements. Who benefits from this? Are we to continue to produce cars that no one in the world wants to drive? No. Most cars will in future be sold in India and China and other developing countries, and they want low-energy cars. Our planet wants low-energy cars and Europe’s consumers want low-energy cars. Are we, then, to allow the car industry to live in a fantasy world where they can continue to produce cars that no one wants? No. This is a bad policy for the environment, for consumers, for the economy and for research. A total failure, in other words. We are therefore unable to support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that the average CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from cars sold in 2005 were 159 grams per kilometre, on the basis of this regulation introducing a binding target for 2020 of 95 grams per kilometre, we will have cut the average emissions from cars sold by 38% in 2020. It is quite easy to work out, and you do not need an impact assessment to get the answer. I think it is extraordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">My apologies to those of you who have praised me and thanked me for my work and who approve of this compromise, which seems to me to be a large majority of you, but allow me to address mainly the dissenters and our friends from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, namely Mr Davies, who are once again demonstrating their inability to take responsibility. They just call for wonderful targets, but when it comes to decision time, they leave it to us to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I only hope that the same farce does not begin that I had over REACH (the Regulation on chemicals and their safe use), because these same groups said that REACH too was giving in, that it was a betrayal. A month later it was heralded on their websites as a great environmental success for the Union, making the EU the world leader, we might say, in the control of chemical substances. I hope that this time I will be spared such a farce.</p>

The conference focused on electric cars. It is obvious that the time is right to switch to this environmentally friendly technology. The era of fossil fuels has run its course.</p>
<p class="contents">The current crisis which the car industry is facing also offers opportunities to completely change tack. The manufacturers must, in exchange for the government support and guarantees they are receiving, invest far more in this technology of the future, or affordable batteries with a greater range, in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">The government, in turn, should support this switch far more resolutely, not least fiscally.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2005, there has been a Commission proposal on the table to reform car tax and to coordinate this at European level. This proposal should be re-submitted to the ministers. Car tax should be re-calculated on the basis of emissions criteria. People who drive electric cars and emit hardly any CO<span class="sub">2</span> or soot particles, if at all, should be rewarded fiscally for this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for a radical switch. The engineers have done their bit. It is now up to the government to push the car manufacturers further in the right direction and to do so quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European automotive industry is part and parcel of Europe’s strategy to achieve a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases, make our economy less energy-intensive and increase the proportion of energy derived from renewable sources by 2020 in comparison to 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly relevant as regards reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions. According to EU data, private cars produce 12% of all CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions on the territory of the Community. This high level of emissions is mainly due to the increasing number of cars and to greater use of road transport, which has not been compensated for by improvements in engine construction or reduction in vehicle weight.</p>
<p class="contents">It is planned to reduce the CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission limits for private cars to 120 grams per kilometre by 2012. It is also planned to set out a long-term strategy for the reduction of this limit to 95 grams per kilometre by 2020. This is in line with the European Parliament’s opinion that it takes five to seven years to bring out new types of motor vehicles. This of course impacts on the development and production cycles of the motor vehicle industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles adopted are certainly ambitious from an environmental point of view. On the other hand, increased investment in research and development required due to the new standards will encourage scientific research on technical solutions to achieve fuel saving. This increases the level of innovation in the motor vehicle sector, which will in turn promote the competitiveness of Europe’s economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sales figures are falling and many factories have suspended production until the end of the year. In Germany, every seventh job depends directly or indirectly on car manufacture. One important policy objective must be to create framework conditions to protect jobs in Germany even in times of crisis. The regulation has therefore come along at completely the wrong time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that the report tabled does not create incentives to stem emissions. This would, in my opinion, have been the right approach to climate change, including in times of economic crisis. The threat of horrendous penalties is not a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore of the opinion that private agendas are being pursued here to the detriment of the German economy. What is important to me is to promote protection of the climate, but not to the detriment of individual EU Member States. This regulation hits not only German car manufacturers themselves, but also, above all, the mostly medium-sized suppliers, many of which are located in the Nürnberg Metropolitan Region. As a new MEP for Nürnberg, I cannot therefore vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
