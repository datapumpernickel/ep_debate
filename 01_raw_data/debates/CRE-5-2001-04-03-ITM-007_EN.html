<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer</span></span>  , <span class="italic">Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget process for any given budget year starts with priority setting, and this morning we debated the priorities for the 2002 budget. The conclusion of the budget process is the discharge granted by the European Parliament, which we have been debating today in respect of the 1999 budget. The discharge decision is a vital moment for the Commission and Parliament, as Parliament's democratic control functions come into full play at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">This control extends to many areas, as the EU budget is very substantial – it amounted to EUR 84 billion in 1999 – and above all it covers a wide variety of activities, ranging from support for olive oil, nuts and school milk to student exchanges; from the development of petrol-saving cars to space research or information on the euro, from support for educating women in Africa to the restructuring of the fishing fleet or to food aid after an earthquake or after a civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this wide range, which I have just listed by way of example, control of the budget process covers nearly all the Commission's activities. Mr Blak, the general rapporteur for the budget discharge, adopted exactly this approach to the wide-ranging control of a broad spectrum of policy areas in respect of which public money is spent. This was hard work for everyone concerned. This is demonstrated by the detailed questionnaires, but also and above all by the report before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak, you have a reputation for being a very harsh critic of mismanagement. Having worked with you over these past months, I can really confirm that and bear witness that you have lived up to your reputation. At the same time, I would like to thank you for the balance and fairness of your report and for the clear approach that you adopted in it. The aim of that approach was to highlight both good and bad features in all areas, and to insist through your decisions and evaluations on achieving an improvement in Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be taking measures in response to your most important findings. As all good chefs know, the key to culinary success is to cook the right ingredients at the right temperature. The committee has devoted many hours of meetings to the discharge process, and above all it has held various hearings with the Commissioners responsible. I would also like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you for the excellent cooperation and work in the committee, and to extend those thanks to the chair of the committee, Mrs Theato.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis for the annual discharge procedure is the Court of Auditors' annual report. For 1999, the Court gave the Commission a positive Statement of Assurance on the revenue side, for commitment appropriations and for administrative expenditure, but not for other payment transactions, as has also been the case in previous years. The committee and the rapporteur have not only relied on the professional work of the Court for their reports, but also on material provided by the Commission, and on detailed replies, on several extensive questionnaires and on a summary of a great many audit reports and on the audit reports themselves. The rapporteur, Mr Blak, examined over 60 of the documents provided by the Commission, running to several thousand pages.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key documents for the whole discharge procedure is the Commission's discharge action plan. In this document the Commission presents the precise measures it is taking in order to respond to the Court of Auditors' criticisms. These are not vague promises – the plan specifies in precise terms what is to be done and when. The same applies to the follow-up report – 48 pages in all – to the European Parliament's discharge decision for the 1998 budget. This report gives a detailed response to the requests made in Mrs Stauner's report from last year. Follow-up actions to this are presented such that they can be verified.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement the action plan for the European Development Fund the Commission last year undertook the necessary work in conjunction with Parliament. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, for her work and for making it clear that the discharge for the European Development Fund has not been rejected, but postponed. The proposal to postpone the discharge is, of course, still a matter of regret for the Commission, because it unilaterally decided to considerably extend inquiries into macroeconomic aid in Africa, for example, in order to get to the bottom of some problems in that area. Mrs Rühle has recognised that these are steps in the right direction. I can safely say that overall the administration of European Development Fund money is by no means worse than the administration of development aid from the EU budget. But I can in any case assure the Mrs Rühle as rapporteur that the Commission will make good use of this time to complete the outstanding documents without delay and to take the necessary steps here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank two other rapporteurs, Mrs van der Laan and Mr Seppänen. Although the ECSC Treaty expires next year, the relevant research activity will continue. The audit findings here are also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal objective and the Commission's objective is to improve financial management, to reduce fraud, to avoid errors, be they purely formal errors or errors with budgetary implications, and also to improve efficiency and ensure that public funds are used more effectively. These are very important objectives which require a joint effort to achieve. I have in mind above all the joint efforts of the Commission and the Member States, as 83% of the funds under the EU budget are administered by the Member States. The primary duty of control falls to them. We have also had detailed discussions in the Ecofin Council on these duties for the Member States. However, I still cannot say that I am entirely satisfied with the Member States' responses to the Court of Auditors' report, but at least more detailed information is now available about what the Member States have done in recent years to combat fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the areas of Community policy implemented by the Member States are, as we all know, also very much prone to fraud. One such area that I would like to mention here is that of agricultural export refunds. In this area, it is necessary to continuously check not only the procedures themselves, but also the control mechanisms. I say this because the control systems are not only weaker the further south you travel – which is a common perception – but also, in some regions which claim to have Prussian efficiency, there is in fact a somewhat <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> approach to control systems. In this case, the Commission relies not only on it own audits but it can also hit Member States' purses, by which I mean the use of financial sanctions by reducing payments to Member States. This sometimes – relatively often even – leads to protracted disputes and sometimes actual litigation. But I do not believe that that financial sanctions are discredited because of this, that is just how things are in a state bound by the rule of law. However, what is important is that the Commission should also use legal means to secure its position.</p>
<p class="contents">Export refunds are also an example of the fact that the legal bases are sometimes so detailed and specific that they can almost act as an incentive to fraudulent behaviour. For that reason it has also been agreed, under the administrative reform, that proposals for regulations put forward by the Commission should in future be scrutinised with regard to their susceptibility to fraud. In this respect I would also like to request extra cooperation from Parliament in its legislative role and special support from the Committee on Budgets, because stricter control procedures are not always welcomed with open arms by the relevant specialist committees or even the countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with the legislature is absolutely essential for good financial management. Let me mention a very topical example of this: the Council recently decided in Stockholm – and this is actually supposed to be something positive, at least in the Council's eyes – that the Sixth Framework Programme on Research would be adopted in July 2002 but actually start as early as 1 January 2003. However, that simply does not allow enough time to properly carry out the tendering process and the preparatory work. If this timetable is not changed, we will quite consciously be embarking on a course leading to the kind of errors that the Court of Auditors and above all Parliament criticised with the last Framework Programme. I believe that we should not let history repeat itself. We must learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">The "Fléchard case" started with the export of surplus intervention butter as aid to the former Soviet Union. The decisions concerned were made by the previous Commission between 1991 and 1994. Parliament investigated this case very thoroughly. The Court of Auditors analysed this case in detail and UCLAF and OLAF carried out various investigations. The present Commission has also examined the case from all angles and it has made all the information in its possession available to you as discharge authority. We all agree that it is not possible to undo what was done at that time. That is why you as discharge authority are justified in asking what would happen now if a similar case arose.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the arrangements have changed since 1994. The regulation on the clearance of accounts procedure in the field of agricultural policy has been amended, and the division responsible for clearance of accounts in the relevant Directorate-General has been organisationally separated. In 1995 the regulation on the protection of the Community's financial interests, the "black list", was introduced, which the Member States are supposed to use to list companies who have shown gross negligence or have deliberately acted against the financial interests of the EU. Mr Blak is pressing here for an improvement in the procedure for drawing up this black list. I can assure you that we are already working on this. OLAF would then become the Community's independent investigatory authority, an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the future, not only have important changes been initiated through administrative reform, the new version of the Financial Regulation will provide a clearer framework, especially for the recovery of payments. This means that the recovery of payments can only be waived in part or in full if the Director-General responsible so decides, and in particular the decision to forego recovery must be justified. In case of doubt the Commission must decide. During the debates the Commission has also given Parliament an assurance that it will base the application of the administrative and legal principle of proportionality on clear, solid and transparent guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the long answer to the question "Would the Commission handle a similar case in exactly the same way now?" The short answer is "No!" It would take a different approach in comparable cases today.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear objective of the administrative reform of the Commission is to improve financial management. That is why the control functions of the individual Directorate-Generals have been beefed up, and why the Internal Audit Service has been strengthened, and that is why a central financial service has been created, the early warning system reinforced, and the recovery arrangements tightened up. We are improving the implementation of programmes of expenditure and we are building up the network of controls, and will not hesitate to impose financial sanctions. The 10-point black list in the report on reform will help us to take these further steps. I can assure you on behalf of the Commission that a decision by Parliament to grant a budget discharge within the specified time will act as a great incentive for the Commission to implement the reforms and persevere in its efforts.</p>

<p class="contents">This broad spectrum of European funding tasks also includes foreign policy. Europe is a major player on the foreign policy stage, especially in non-military crisis management, and the Committee knows that different problems arise with these budget headings than with funds administered within the European Union by the Member States. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has therefore made it a priority to ensure that the decisions adopted by this House are also implemented. It is unacceptable that year after year, billions of euro are not spent because the services, the cooperation with the Directorate-General, do not function effectively. That is our criticism of this budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been restructuring within the new Commission. <span class="italic">Europe Aid</span> has been launched, and we expect that as a result, the programmes agreed by Parliament will be implemented more speedily in future. But at the same time, we expect the Commission to refrain from setting up its own new implementing organisation and to draw instead on Member States' competencies, as they should be playing an active role in this area as well. We want the political management of all these problems to be undertaken in Europe, but we also want the allocated funds to be drawn down.</p>
<p class="contents">In a year's time, we will measure your success in terms of what you have done with the many additional posts which have been created. So this issue will undoubtedly arise once again during the next budgetary procedure, including the discharge procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the justice and home affairs sector, Mr Blak’s report quite rightly focuses on three issues, as we ourselves have done in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the obvious poor management of some of the budget lines, where the rate of implementation of appropriations is below 50%. Secondly, the need for the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia to update its techniques and to enforce stricter management.

The committee took a common approach in its opinion on the need to improve the quality of action and performance as a way of achieving better value for taxpayers' money. For example, we wish to remind the Commission of the need to achieve higher standards in auditing the research programmes, particularly in the context of the European research area proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We also look to the Commission to improve the management of contracts by the Joint Research Centre. This is a theme continued from the past. We are looking for improvement in the management of TACIS and other programmes in the field of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe. We put forward the suggestion of creating a separate budget line for strengthening cooperation on nuclear safety in northern parts of Europe. We observe that the SYNERGY programme seems to have lost some of its priority in the Commission and we wish to see this programme continued successfully. We want more spending on SYNERGY.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the other report on the coal and steel part of the budget. The committee is very keen on seeing maximum transparency in the disclosure of data concerning the value of the ECSC's assets. We note the Commission's undertaking on the provision of information about these assets and expect this information to be delivered.</p>

<p class="contents">It is tremendously important that the very little amount of money we have should be spent efficiently and effectively. Fortunately we tend not to suffer from the allegations of fraud and mismanagement that one sees elsewhere but we do have a problem about the very worthy organisations that want support from Parliament actually receiving the money. Just to give three examples for the 1999 financial year we are looking at: the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation only received their grant from the European Commission in the last days of the year. This causes real problems for those organisations. We accepted it for 1999, but I hope it will not recur in the year 2000. I would say to the Commissioner: please ensure that if we are going to give money, we do it efficiently and effectively so that it does good rather than damage to the European cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sad to report that the figures for 1999 show that this was the first year ever when the least developed countries received under 50% of overseas development aid administered by the Commission. This is a trend we desperately need to reverse. As Mr Blak's resolution states in paragraph 8, point 19 – and I thank him for this – when 880 million people world-wide lack any access to health services, just 1% of the Commission's external assistance budget went to health in 1999 and we do not have any figures at all for education.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this a discharge issue? Yes, quite clearly, when the Community Action Plan in response to our parliamentary resolution on the 1998 discharge said: "Since health and education will receive more emphasis, the implication is that a greater amount of financing than in the past would be dedicated to these sectors." It goes on to say, "Adopting OECD standards on reporting should be feasible by 2001." Mrs Schreyer, we insist that the Commission must fulfil these promises. Your so-called reservation against the output targets properly voted by Parliament precisely to increase spending on basic health and education is contrary to the agreed budget. Whatever happens this year, you cannot expect discharge for 2001 unless they are fulfilled. On the essential reporting needed, using the OECD Development Assistance Committee methodology to enable us to achieve this poverty focus, we have more concern over whether this is achieved for Asia and Latin America as against our aid for the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation did not vote to postpone discharge for the European Development Fund. We did not want to send the wrong signal against the strong support we wish to demonstrate for the reform process. But if discharge is postponed, I thank Mrs Rühle for her insistence that the latest figures using the DAC methodology are brought forward by May. This will ensure that the poorest people actually receive the aid. I defy anyone to disagree with that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to restrict my comments to Freddy Blak's excellent report on the Commission discharge for 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">1999 – what a year that was. Not only was it the first year that I was elected – and hold back your cheers now – but in budgetary control terms it was fascinating. It was the year of three types of Commission: two months of the old Commission that had a number of problems that we all know about; six months of no Commission whatsoever because they were not taking any management decisions; and then the rest of the year was with the new Commission who had no time to implement any of the reforms. 1999 – another year with an error rate of about 5% or roughly EUR 4.5 billion. 1999 – the sixth year running that the Court of Auditors refused to write off the accounts. 1999 – the year in which Freddy Blak found huge errors, fraud and problems in the accounts, scandals all of them including, for example, the wonderful Washington delegation that warranted a whole two paragraphs in the report. I believe the Commissioner will be able to confirm that the building was bought for USD 0.5 million, refurbished to the tune of USD 2.2 million – that is four times what it was bought for – whilst renting somewhere else for about USD 18 000 per month which was cheaper than where the Commission's residence was beforehand because I believe it was in the Four Seasons Hotel.</p>
<p class="contents">There were other problems with IRELA, flax and Fléchard, too, and all we have to do in this House is look at our previous reports. We have consistently said that if the error rate does not improve in the 1999 year, then we could not and should not pass these accounts. The error rate quite simply did not improve. I checked with the Court of Auditors and they confirmed that the error rate was the same or marginally worse.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions should we draw from this? It is fairly obvious: the error rate did not improve; EUR 4.5 billion lost, unaccounted for, mismanaged; we do not give discharge. I hear that the Socialists and other Groups are actually thinking of granting discharge and I cannot think why. How on earth are we going to explain that back home? Please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this Commission to fall. You simply will not. There is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen. 1999 is not the year for which this Commission is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">What you will be doing, however, is sending a message to this Commission and the public who elected us here – you remember them, some of them actually bother to visit us occasionally – that we are steadfastly against waste, fraud and mismanagement; that we are drawing a line in the sand, that what went before 1999 was completely unacceptable and what happens now and in the future must be better. Commissioner, I would appreciate your answer on the Washington delegation because it is very odd that we do not get to see a number of these facts until we actually ask for them. I also ask you to promise us that the error rate will improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> – Mr President, I endorse the proposal to grant discharge to the Commission for three reasons. Firstly, things have improved. Both the Court of Auditors and Parliament have been able to establish that. The first results of the Commission reforms are now visible, especially in the field of financial management and control.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has carried out some sterling work. There has been effective consultation between the different rapporteurs and the Commission. The Commission has taken us seriously. As far as I am concerned, there is a break in the trend compared to the previous Commission, which did not take the discharge process and this Parliament sufficiently seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I think that we should deploy the discharge tool, which this Parliament has at its disposal, selectively. Instead of wielding the axe, as is sometimes referred to in this Parliament, we should use Mr Blak’s surgical filleting knife, which will yield us more results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw your attention to a number of aspects. Firstly, financial supervision will soon be divorced from internal audit within the European Commission. This Parliament will be voting on this on Thursday. It is one of the most important recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men have made. It is also the first reform which is being enshrined in legislation. This reform does not only apply to the European Commission, but also to the Council and Parliament. I notice that the Secretary-General is present today, and I would call on him too to implement this reform in Parliament itself at the earliest opportunity. The other institutions should take a long and hard look at this too.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to further refine and further politicise the discharge instrument. The DAS, the Statement of Assurance, must be improved. We need to focus more on the different sectors so as to be able to draw a distinction between the different areas of policy. We must single out Member States if they make mistakes – we will hopefully do this also by means of an amendment to Mr Blak’s report – and we should not only look at figures, but also at the quality of policy. Mrs Van der Laan is right to make the first move in this connection in her report on other institutions, which I, by the way, congratulate on their policy. We will postpone the discharge for the Economic and Social Committee, but I have a feeling that this will be granted soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, officials who make mistakes within the Commission and within the other institutions must be disciplined if these mistakes involve financial problems. We call for a committee on financial irregularities to be set up which can deal with this kind of matter and can make referrals to the disciplinary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and I would echo the opinion which Mrs Van der Laan expressed this morning in the debate – it is necessary for us to call the Council to account now. The budget of the Council is taking on ever increasing proportions. In areas such as justice, home affairs and foreign affairs, the Council has more or less exclusive rights. It is no longer acceptable that in this discharge procedure, in which we not only verify the figures but also the quality of policy, the Council’s increasing budget is still not subject to proper democratic control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish all rapporteurs every success in their work, and Mr Blak, in particular, who will probably ensure, for the first time in many years, that the Commission will be granted discharge on time. I hope I can congratulate him on that tomorrow. In fact, I also hope that he has enjoyed reading the answers to his questions. They turned out to be rather lengthy, and got the better of me at times.</p>
<p class="contents">The hallmark of this budget is the fact that the Statement of Assurance is still not positive. This has to become positive, and Parliament must also be able to judge whether any progress is being made in that respect. We as a group support every effort to secure this Statement of Assurance and we believe that it should be extended to include every sector, or maybe to include every Directorate-General.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few general points. The figures which we are familiar with show that agriculture is in a considerably better position than the other sections of the budget. That is very positive. Compared to the other sectors, agriculture can afford to present the margin of error of 3%, although this is probably still far too high. The Commission must apply this as soon as possible to the other sections of the policy, and other Commissioners must follow Mr Fischler’s lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the superlevy in agriculture. We all know the system of milk quota. All farmers in Europe pay extra if they produce too much milk. There is one country which forms an exception to this rule, namely Italy. The Italian government pays the levy on behalf of the farmers. Is this not a case of distortion of competition? Should the Commission not do something about this promptly?</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the Commissioner’s reply further to the Fléchard affair. Although we do not have all the facts of what happened between 1991-1994, there is every reason to believe that it was unacceptable. We are pleased with the fact that the present Commission has dissociated itself from this and that it is submitting proposals as soon as possible, which pertain, among other things, to the way in which the proportionality principle can be applied. What is the responsibility of the officials in this respect? When should it be assessed by the Commission or Commissioner himself, etc.? What are the exact procedures to be followed in those cases?</p>
<p class="contents">There are still many ambiguities surrounding flax. What will be important for this Parliament is the question as to what will ultimately be the financial correction which the Commission will apply to the countries which are involved in this. This will probably not only affect Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion on behalf of the group is that we will be granting discharge. We are aware that this is the last year for which the Commission can say that it was not responsible. The real test for the current Commission will come with the examination of the accounts for 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Budgetary Control has worked very hard for the past four months, and held meetings in quick succession. We are inclined to grant the Commission discharge for the 1999 budget. Does this mean that everything is smelling of roses, or that nothing is going wrong? No. After all, the Court of Auditors is refusing to guarantee that the payments were, generally speaking, legitimate and regular. Commissioner, we are extremely dissatisfied with this state of affairs. We would therefore ask you to ensure that you will receive from the Court of Auditors a positive Statement of Assurance by no later than 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we should still be mindful of the fact that the Member States are responsible for more than 80% of all expenditure. I would once again like to lodge a complaint against the Council for its absence, and against the Economic and Financial Affairs Council for the nonchalance which it is displaying in dealing with the discharge. This is shoddy work and cannot be taken seriously. The Member States are still insufficiently aware of the fraud issue. I therefore urge the Irish, Luxembourg and Belgian parliaments to ratify the anti-fraud agreement, which was concluded in 1995, without delay. I myself am starting a campaign today to convince my national counterparts to ratify this agreement in Belgium before July of this year. As far as I am concerned, this is absolutely crucial if the Belgian Presidency is to build up any credibility with regard to anti-fraud policy. The Blak report contains many positive statements with regard to the Commission. As permanent rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, I can bear witness to the excellent work of our delegation in Sarajevo. But we should also turn our attention to a few of the less attractive issues: the flax case, the latest developments of which, it is true, we are not yet fully conversant with, the mafia case involving adulterated butter, and, indeed, the Fléchard case.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you were right in saying that we have spent a generous amount of time on this issue. There is indeed something peculiar about it, and I have listened very carefully to your statement and pledges in this connection. With an unqualified ‘no’, you have told us that this will not happen in future. You promised a solid basis for the application of the principle of proportionality. You also promised to change tack as regards debt collection. As far as my group is concerned, you herewith comply with the conditions contained in Paragraph 8, I d) of the Blak resolution, and I can inform you, on behalf of my group, that we will be granting you discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Mr Santer’s Commission had to resign in connection with the debate on discharge in 1997, despite the support of the Social Democrat group, the GUE/NGL Group was consistently in favour of resignation. There were too many irregularities and the administrative culture it represented was a spurious one. The situation in 1999 was different. Responsibility was unevenly divided between Mr Santer’s Commission that had resigned and the new Commission. It was hard to say which of them was responsible for what. Now it is harder to come up with detailed arguments as to why discharge should not be granted. The Committee on Budgetary Control has not uncovered any instances of malpractice or unclear areas that are so major that they cannot be left until the discharge debate for 2000. When deciding on discharge for 2000 it is known that the present Commission is responsible for everything, including those matters that were not brought to a conclusion for 1999. The majority of our group on this occasion is in favour of granting the Commission discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Parliament’s own discharge, attention should be paid to those abuses that the political groups were guilty of in connection with financing the Europarties. These have been spoken of with unwarranted sensitivity. I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Stauner: a framework agreement with regard to the supply of information from the Commission is not enough. We now have to take stock of the experience we have gained and return to the matter in association with discharge for 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a year when the present Commission was only able to influence the final quarter of the year and so cannot be held responsible for a very great deal. The reason why we decided to vote against the discharge was because, in 1999 too, there were so many instances of citizens’ money being mismanaged that it would have been wrong to give the seal of approval constituted by the discharge. I do not have enough speaking time to mention all the scandals but would refer to my good colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, and my other capable colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control who mentioned a number of the problems with which we have been confronted. My good colleague, Freddy Blak, has written an excellent report, and I really only disagree with him about the actual conclusion, namely that discharge should be given.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak has made a great effort to find answers to quite a few questions. The more harmless questions have been answered, but the evasive or inadequate answers to other questions are unacceptable. We are still waiting for a clear indication of responsibility and for those responsible for the mistakes to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Construction policy, development aid, modernisation and improved efficiency in both agriculture and structural funding are all areas in which the Commission has still not made sufficient progress. Commissioner Schreyer stated that a black list of fraudulent businesses had been drawn up. I cannot help noticing that the ‘Fléchard’ company, which is now for the second time reported to have taken part in serious financial and health-related fraud, is missing from this list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This almost creates the impression that the facts are irrelevant. That is, of course, not the case. The Members of this Parliament do, however, reach different conclusions based on facts. And this is all tied in with the interpretation of the facts and the trust in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">When it took up office in 1999, this Commission was facing a huge challenge, namely to carry out the necessary reforms in its official apparatus, clean up its image and handle old fraud cases. With regard to the discharge for 1998 and 1999, I wonder to what extent we can hold the new Commission responsible for the mismanagement of the old one. The facts are there for everyone to see: fraud involving subsidies for flax in Spain, artificial butter in Italy, and ESF funding in the Netherlands. Interpreting these facts is a great deal harder. The cited instances of fraud all took place before the eyes of the Member States, and they should be penalised for this aspect, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Court of Auditors is refusing to issue a Statement of Assurance with regard to the Commission’s accounts weighs heavily upon the Commission. Any other business would be threatened in its very existence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, if the Commission were to give off the air of confidence that it was aware of its political accountability and would act accordingly, I would be in favour of discharge. However, the Commission’s conduct left a great deal to be desired during the hearings of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Unfortunately, my confidence has taken a proportionate dive. That is why I would be in favour of postponing the discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">With the exception of Commissioner Patten, who has shown his political accountability by bringing the subsidies to IRELA to an end, Commissioner Schreyer and Lamy, in particular, have demonstrated that they excel at talking without saying anything. Whilst Commissioner Fischler recognises that the Commission’s conduct in the Fléchard affair is far from exemplary, Commissioner Schreyer refused to make a declaration that this kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated in future. I appreciate what she said at the beginning of this afternoon’s session, but to make such a declaration under pressure of postponement of the discharge is hardly credible.</p>
<p class="contents">When it took up office, the Commission had the trust of this Parliament. It is now high time that they proved to us – in word and deed – that they are worthy of this trust.</p>
<p class="contents">This may well mean that Commissioner de Palacio may need to stand down if it appears that she was actually aware of the flax fraud in Spain. The entire Commission can start by addressing the ten points in the resolution with regard to the discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must certainly accept the idea that the discharge is not a populist denunciation in itself. However, once we appointed the Commission and it therefore enjoyed our trust – until we censured it, that is – the discharge procedure was a joint process of negotiation between players working in good faith and seeking to improve the management of the European Union’s budget. We must be aware that the discharge procedure is a specific task, carried out within a limited timescale – it is a financial task, which has well defined scope, we can grant the discharge or we can postpone it, but we can never reject it outright, because that would require upsetting the sequence of balances. The aim of the discharge, at the end of the day, is not to repeat the act of authorising the budget. The discharge is not an opportunistic step, but a step to punish irregularities and to punish a possible lack of optimal management. The discharge is a framework which we must hold onto if we wish to avoid certain dramatic events being repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I welcome all of the above. I shall make three comments on what has happened here this year. First of all, I acknowledge that there is a serious problem, namely the imbalance between the Commission and Member States’ responsibilities in relation to the discharge. Eighty per cent of the appropriations are still spent by Member States and we grant discharge to the Commission. That is why I believe it is difficult for us to demand in a suitably effective manner the improvement of a positive Statement of Assurance. We are punishing those who are only partially responsible for what is happening to them. Before imposing sanctions on the Commission, I would like the various pockets of Eurosceptics to allow more extensive monitoring in their own countries on the way in which spending is carried out in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment – and I am hurrying through this – concerns relations between OLAF and the European Parliament, which have not yet settled. In this case, the need for transparency must be reconciled with maintaining the confidentiality of certain information and of the individual’s right to protection. That does not always happen. Lastly, we are being very badly affected by an imbalance, on the issue of fraud, between a repressive and largely administrative unit and a judicial unit with powers of jurisdiction that is still in its infancy. That is what constitutes the real scandal in the Fléchard affair. The misunderstandings of the Fléchard case can be explained by the fact that we, the European Union and the Commission, were in a position to levy punishment in administrative terms, without showing consideration for the individual’s right to protection. It is essential that we correct this imbalance by enhancing our powers of jurisdiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was one sentence in Mr Blak's report which I particularly liked. On page 34, in his Explanatory Statement, he says that the discharge procedure will ideally result in a win-win scenario. In other words, everyone will win: the Commission as the auditee and Parliament as the auditor, and therefore, of course, the taxpayers as well, some of whom are sitting up in the public gallery. But this means that a change of approach is sometimes required too. Unfortunately, there are quite a number of areas in which the Commission has failed to do this – but it has done so, at least, in the field in which I am slightly more involved, namely the fight against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than three weeks have passed since we adopted a resolution here in Strasbourg demanding access to a whole series of reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Until then, we had been systematically denied access to these reports. Mr Brüner, the Director of the European Anti-Fraud Office, has now made all of them available to us. He has thus asserted his position against those in the Commission whose motto when providing information to this House is ‘as little and as late as possible’. This has also been the stance of the Commission's apparently omnipotent Legal Service until now, and we can only hope that the forthcoming change-over at the head of this service will prompt a change of attitude in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">So what information can we glean from these OLAF reports? Even for someone who has worked on this material for a long time, it is staggering to witness the scale and sophistication with which cross-border Europe-wide fraud is orchestrated at the expense of the EU budget. Let's take the example of adulterated butter. This mixture of beef suet and chemical substances was produced under the control of the Mafia in Italy, but was marketed primarily by companies in France, and to some extent, and rather circuitously, through a firm in London, in order to conceal this major fraud even further and erase any leads.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the prerequisite, as it were, for the fraud – which was unprecedented in its scope and scale – to operate successfully for so many years. Or let us take the case of flax. At first, this focussed solely on Spain. Then we found out that other Member States were affected as well and that ultimately, the fraud in Spain was only possible because a company in Belgium was issuing purchase certificates for non-existent deliveries. I am pleased to say that despite the stormy political debates in Spain, the cooperation between the Spanish authorities and OLAF is apparently running smoothly and there is a great deal of determination to clear up the matter and bring those responsible to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Even now, OLAF is often at its weakest – and it is important to say this loud and clear – when investigating internal irregularities. This is most apparent in the case of the alleged disappearance of files in the Fléchard affair. This case was approached extremely tentatively. I can understand that. After all, a thorough investigation might reveal that senior and very senior officials have quite simply been telling lies. This is one explanation, but it is no justification. And when OLAF carries out its investigations quickly and efficiently, as in the case of the Stockholm representation, the Commission is remarkably slow to impose the necessary disciplinary measures. This is why the call for a rapid entry into the first phase of a European public prosecution service is so important. We need the "internal" public prosecutor so that the investigations within the institutions can be carried out as thoroughly as possible and the appropriate measures can be taken. It is the Commission's credibility, not least, which is at stake here. For this reason, I would ask you, Ms Schreyer, to present an appropriate report to this House as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the discharge, Denmark was subject to a critical comment which is a scathing criticism of the way in which the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries handles export aid payments. It is quite extraordinary that, in Denmark, there are cases going right back to 1996. This means that Danish export businesses are severely hampered in their operations at the moment and that there is a considerable distortion of competition vis-à-vis other EU countries. This is far and away the harshest criticism ever levelled at Denmark, and in this case, mind you, it is the central authorities who have failed. I must therefore urge the Commission to ensure that the Danish rules on export aid are normalised as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what the Committee on Budgetary Control recommended by a clear majority last week, in line with the proposal put forward by our rapporteur, Freddy Blak, to whom I should like to pay tribute for his excellent work. However, last week's recommendation was made in the expectation that the Commission would provide final clarification on a number of outstanding points. I know that the decision of many of my colleagues – and indeed my own too – here in the House will depend on this taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these issues? Let me sum them up in four key phrases. The first is the Fléchard case. Ms Schreyer, you have just stated clearly that the Commission would not proceed in this way today. I am gratified to hear it. But let me remind you that although you were all good enough to come to the Committee – and I thank you for that – it was rather irksome that you could not bring yourselves to respond in such unequivocal terms in the Committee. It would have made things much easier for us – for both sides – if you had done so. But I must say that we are looking to the future, and we will be able to boost confidence more effectively through openness than by wasting words and ultimately being none the wiser.</p>
<p class="contents">My second key phrase is the Statement of Assurance. This is the sixth time in succession that a negative Statement of Assurance has been issued by the Court of Auditors, despite some improvements in a number of areas. It is not enough for the Commission to respond to Parliament's repeated calls for the error rates to be reduced by saying that it will do its best. No, we want tangible results. The DAS must be positive by 2002. This House is prepared to work with the Commission and the Court of Auditors to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The third key phrase is access to information. Many people's hopes of the Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament have been disappointed. I was sceptical from the outset, but as the Chairman of the Committee, I ensured that the provisions of the Agreement were strictly adhered to. Yet the Commission still failed to provide all the information requested. The long list of reports requested but not received, contained in the Annex to Mr Blak's report, speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, Ms Schreyer, the Commission is cutting off its nose to spite its face. You cannot really expect that when in doubt, Parliament will intercede and defend you from unjustified attacks unless you provide us with the necessary information first.</p>
<p class="contents">And my last point: This House has called on the Commission repeatedly and with a broad majority to put forward proposals on the immediate introduction of a European Public Prosecutor's office. Its first task should be to deal with fraud within the European institutions. The previous speakers have also raised this issue. On this basis, a European Public Prosecutor's office could be introduced immediately and without any amendment to the Treaties. This was recommended by the five wise men in their report on reforming the Commission, as well as by OLAF's Supervisory Committee. Parliament gave the Commission until the end of March to state its position on this issue. Ms Schreyer, I asked you about this issue during the last part-session. Will I finally get a clear statement from you today?</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control has submitted five other reports on discharge. I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent work. Ms Stauner's follow-up report on the 1998 discharge should be singled out in particular. We must carefully verify whether our demands from last year have been fulfilled by the Commission, in order to strengthen mutual confidence, openness and responsibility. Unfortunately, a number of points are still unresolved, especially the issue of a positive DAS, which I have already mentioned, as well as the issue of information for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this weakness, not least, which led to the recommendation by the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, that the discharge in respect of implementation of the European Development Funds be postponed – and quite rightly, in my view. Mr Folias' report is considered and coherent. It contains no proposed amendments. I should like to express my great appreciation of, and agreement with, the content of his report. The reports by Ms van der Laan and Mr Seppänen were approved and adopted by the Committee.</p>

I should like to make it clear that the Social Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control have a good result to show for the recorded vote on Parliament's freedom of information. This may not apply to all the Groups here in this Chamber. But I think it is appropriate to point this out.</p>
<p class="contents">A word to the Commission. You should be aware that we are taking this seriously: we expect the Commission to do its utmost to ensure that a positive Statement of Assurance can be issued in 2003. In anticipation of what I have heard about the content of some of tomorrow's proposed amendments – which had not been submitted in writing by the start of this afternoon's sitting – I say this: we will not support any attempt to introduce an automatic process which effectively requires us, as Parliament, to cede our own right as the decision-making body on the issue of discharge and makes us a kind of secretariat for the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the PPE-DE must clarify its own position on this issue too. You cannot table motions which aim to introduce this kind of automatic process and at the same time, in the committee meetings, emphasise the scope for political discretion in the granting of discharge, as Ms Theato tends to do. There is a clear contradiction here, and the group really must clarify its position. In any event, we will certainly not hand in Parliament's right to make its own decision on discharge along with our hats and coats.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of responses to the points raised by Mr Heaton-Harris. If the Court of Auditors does not provide any official error rates – as is the case – this is regrettable and is an issue which we can discuss with the Court of Auditors. But the point of relevance to Parliament as an institution is that it has not done so. As a Parliament, we are not the arbitrators for internal wrangling within the Court of Auditors, and it is not our task to judge what some members of the Court of Auditors may have told others in the corridor about the error rates. If there are any error rates, we expect a clear statement from the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">But Mr Heaton-Harris, you made one point on which I agree with you completely, and the Commission should take note. The political nature of the discharge procedure, which I have just mentioned, does not mean that the Commission can simply collect broken promises and let them mount up endlessly. Sooner or later, a stray spark will set the pile ablaze like a bonfire. You are absolutely right on this point. But I cannot agree with your little attempt to seduce Parliament: you say that we can simply refuse to grant discharge, as there are no legal consequences – there is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen. Here, too, I must remind you that there are different views on this issue within your group. I was given a great deal of support from within your group when I said that since the events of 1998/1999, this annual discharge procedure has acquired a political character. It is, after all, an annual political vote of confidence in the Commission, so there is rather more at stake if we refuse to grant discharge than simply saying, go ahead, there are no legal consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I think everyone in this Chamber is aware of the political consequences which would ensue if discharge were denied under the present circumstances. And this is precisely the reason why, even after the explanations provided by the Commission, we will grant discharge tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable that in this debate, in which we are going to talk about the Council, that that very Council is not represented. Here we have our Secretary-General of Parliament, and here we have the Commissioner, who represents the Commission, but where is the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that this debate is taking place in parallel with a budgetary debate in Sweden and perhaps the Swedish Presidency has little to do with the exercise in question, but I believe that the Council also has a Secretary-General. Mr Solana always tells us that he is not only Mr CFSP but also the Secretary-General of the Council. Then he should come. Or he should appoint a Mr CFSP so that he can be here and listen to what we have to say. His absence is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr President, to communicate to Mr Solana, Secretary-General of the Council, that somebody should be here representing the Council, whether or not that duty falls to the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and also Mr Blak – our good friend Freddy Blak – because he, as a good cyclist and an admirer of the five-times champion Induráin – my compatriot – has been able to produce a successful report and employ great teamwork, given that his report has received a broad consensus in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the report, which is serious, demanding and tough, and I also agree with the final section in which it discharges the budget, because, as has been said here from many different quarters, the Commission is making great efforts to improve things. And also, in this 1999 financial year which, as Mr Heaton-Harris pointed out, has been rather unusual, an interregnum, the facts demonstrate that it is making improvements in the supervision of financial management and also in personnel policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must say that, in my humble opinion, it is doing so very slowly and this creates insecurities and examples of improvisation and also creates a lack of motivation amongst staff. I believe that you should move up a gear and carry out this very promising reform more quickly and more ambitiously because I very much fear that the reform is turning out, in almost all respects, to be unambitious and not the type of reform that was initially intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I intended to begin my speech with a question: does the Commission not have any self-criticism to make? Having heard you say that the Commission’s behaviour would not now be the same as on previous occasions and that we have to seek, for the sake of cooperation in relation to good financial management, an improvement of the regulatory and commitological legal basis, I agree with Mr Van Hulten, because I believe that we are seeing an inflexion in the behaviour and attitude of the Commission. I interpret your words as self-criticism on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have approached this report via the flax issue. The countless filtrations which have taken place lead me to request that this report be declassified, and as an MEP who has read it, I can assure you that there would not be any negative effect if it were declassified and made public. We want a serious, independent and effective investigation, whether or not members of the Commission are responsible, because in Mr Blak’s report there is a very element, and that is that is asks for money which has been inappropriately and fraudulently received to be returned, as well as severe penalties in this regard. We therefore have no problem whatsoever in arguing in favour of declassification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can recall a time when this Committee on Budgetary Control was just a subcommittee of the Committee on Budgets. Mr Aigner, as chairman, fought to have it made a full committee and he also fought to get a Court of Auditors, which we succeeded in getting. Over the years we achieved real control and achieved the possibility to affect the management of the resources of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are in danger of overplaying our hand. The more we shout about fraud and corruption, the less seriously we will be taken unless it is absolutely necessary and unless we know exactly what we are talking about. I want to warn against that because we in the Committee on Budgetary Control used to see ourselves as working with the Commission for the improvement of the management of our resources. Too many people see us now as working against the Commission, and I want to warn that is not a healthy trend.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to refer to the question of the Statement of Assurance and discharge. The Court of Auditors was set up to apply accountancy procedures. It looks at the way money is spent. It looks at the figures and it comes to its conclusion that everything does not fit together and that it cannot give discharge. We have an entirely different responsibility. If you look through the lists which have been mentioned before – whether it be Italian milk quotas, whether it be olive oil in the Mediterranean, whether it be sheep in the United Kingdom and Ireland, whether it be the number of cattle in Corsica – you will find that in every single case it was the Member State that failed, not the European Commission. I am not saying the Commission is perfect, but we cannot oblige the Commission to say "you must crack the whip and every Member State in the European Union will respond", because it will not happen. Anyone who knows the short history of the European Union and the long history of Europe will know that proud states are not going to dance at the crack of a whip by the European Commission. But we can work towards it and we are getting there.</p>
<p class="contents">We will achieve a cohesive Union but we must be responsible in our attitude to the whole question of what is intentionally fraudulent and what are simply mistakes and errors that cannot, in the short term, be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will start off with the Scandinavian countries. The administration of the Stockholm office has proved to be scandalous. We have to wait for the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry. However, I would like to ask the Commission when this will be concluded, and I should also like to know whether the Commission has taken measures to suspend staff after reading the OLAF report? As Niels Busk stated, there have also been considerable problems in Denmark. The problem with the guarantee payments in Denmark, which has not yet been settled, is an absolute disgrace. Being a Danish rapporteur, it is embarrassing to say so, but it is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the flax issue in Spain, I am very delighted that a compromise was successfully reached. I have tried not to get involved in an internal Spanish quarrel. I examined whether the Commission had failed to fulfil its monitoring role, and I do not think this is the case here. However, I should like to thank my Spanish colleagues on both sides for their willingness to cooperate and for the fact that they appreciate the different views.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the ‘Fléchard case’ which has been at the centre of discussion this year. We shall never discover more than we know now. We have set up a special committee, we have sent out additional questionnaires to the Commission and we have invited five new and former Commissioners to a consultation in the committee. OLAF, the expert committee and the Court of Auditors have looked at the case. And what did we learn? We learned that the Delors Commission made a decision for which there was no legal basis. Under no circumstances was there a legal basis for reducing the penalty from six to three million. That was the conclusion of the Court of Auditors, the expert group and OLAF. The Commission reacted, perhaps under pressure from the French government, and turned somersaults to save a company which had most likely even been involved in the fraudulent activities from the beginning. This was just not discovered as there was no thorough investigation of the case. The conclusions of the meeting at which the decisions were made were never put down in writing and cannot now be reconstructed. OLAF has just completed a very thorough investigation, and its conclusions are clear: The files will never be found. If OLAF cannot find them, then how should MEPs be able to?</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must look ahead, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer stated so clearly that there will be no repetition of the ‘Fléchard case’. For the first time, the new Commission has admitted that the decision to reduce the penalty was perfectly open to criticism and that a more thorough investigation should have been carried out. They have also promised to change the rules so that officials will not be able to make that type of decision in the future. I therefore think we should consider closing the case and then devote our energy to holding the Commission to its promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank everyone who has been involved in doing a really great job: the Commission, the staff of the Commission and our people in Parliament. Mr Asadbeg and Mrs Marina Buk Kristensen, in particular, have done an excellent job. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">To my three colleagues, who do not wish to grant discharge, I would like to say that it would really have worried me if they had said that they wanted to grant discharge. That would have meant that my report was not good enough. For some people it is a way of life to be at cross purposes and oppose everything. That is fine, and I accept that, as I also accept them as very good colleagues. It is quite all right that three groups should be voting against this report, in which case the rest of us will take responsibility.</p>

I am referring to the SYNERGY Programme. This energy programme was discontinued in December 1999 by the new Director-General of DG Energy and Transport. There is a difference of opinion over the Programme's minimum threshold. The Director-General only wishes to approve programmes involving amounts of EUR 400 000 and above, whereas the Council's Energy Working Group has set a figure of EUR 200 000.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this dispute, the implementation of the SYNERGY Programme has now been blocked for a year and a half. The whole situation is becoming farcical, for it even proved impossible to reach an agreement at Permanent Representative level and the issue actually ended up on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting on 9 April. Indeed, we risk losing the funds for 2001, which would mean that we would not have implemented two-thirds of an energy budget-line. This House should therefore call upon the Commission to take issue with the incredibly obdurate attitude of the new Director-General, Mr Lamoureux, and ensure that an amicable agreement is reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, how will the Commission deal with uncovered or suspected fraud? Fortunately, we now have OLAF, which was set up in 1999, so today's approach is naturally very different from cases such as Fléchard in 1991. Let me re-emphasise this point: in a similar case, the approach adopted and the decisions taken in Fléchard would not arise today. Of course, the individual factors are also important. We have just been talking about the <span class="italic">blacklist</span>. Here, the current situation is that only companies which have been prosecuted successfully can be blacklisted, and only by the Member States. This is a shortcoming, of course, so we are working on a proposal to grant the Commission the right to blacklist companies as well. But I should mention at the same time that this is a Council regulation. It remains to be seen how the debate on this issue will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the question: if fraud is discovered and a prosecution takes place, how will the courts in the Member States proceed? Yes, we know about this. Various procedures are applied which vary in their speed and thoroughness. I am not implying anything about any Member State, this is simply an observation. So the issue of a European public prosecutor is still on the agenda, of course. Let me say again: we consider that we have no legal basis on which to appoint a European public prosecutor without an amendment to the Treaty. We will present the green paper, and we will also try to exert greater pressure through a directive based on the regulation on the protection of financial interests. So we will keep this issue alive. I am still quite optimistic: perhaps by the time the next Inter-Governmental Conference comes round – although hopefully it will have a different name by then, so perhaps I should say "at the next Convention" – this issue can be dealt with and decided in a different way.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point in this context is that we have presented a communication for an amendment to the disciplinary procedure. I should point out yet again that as part of the budget discharge procedure, the Commission provides Parliament with a list of disciplinary proceedings which commenced or were concluded in a given year, together with their outcomes. As far as I am aware, no Parliament in any Member State is as well-informed about problems and proposed solutions, even in countries which pride themselves on their transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point which was raised was the execution of the budget. A number of speakers highlighted the continuing shortcomings in the execution of the budget – i.e. the translation of the budgetary authorities' decisions into tangible policies – especially in the field of foreign policy. Last year, for example, the budget for the Structural Funds was very poorly implemented. I have to make this clear, because the new programme could not be approved and implemented in all areas. In the area of foreign policy, a great deal has improved; one reason is that for the Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, a different administrative approach has been adopted in line with Parliament's resolutions, which has really proved its worth. And that is also something which we must take into account when considering reforms. As regards the execution of the budget, I should like to reiterate that we will be presenting budget management data to Parliament on a weekly basis from now on. Here, too, I am not aware of any Member State which furnishes its Parliament with such up-to-date information as is the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of a positive DAS: as the Budget Commissioner, I am responsible for the discharge procedure as well, so I would naturally be delighted to have a positive DAS sooner rather than later. That goes without saying. But I also realise that a Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors – and it is the Court's decision, and the Court has not yet decided when it will produce the Statement – cannot be achieved through a single campaign or a few small-scale campaigns and improvements. Instead, we must plough a broad furrow, because each of the difficulties faced in combating fraud and mismanagement in the individual areas – the Structural Funds, agricultural policy, research policy, etc. – demands highly diverse measures. Mr Blak's report makes this very clear. It really is a very broad field, and – to continue with the metaphor – improving the execution of the budget, reducing errors, and avoiding fraud sometimes turn it into a minefield. The Commission's Action Plan and administrative reform are therefore also a mine-clearance programme, so that in future, the budget decisions fall on safe and fertile ground.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I can assure Parliament once again that we will not be downing tools once the discharge decision is taken. On the contrary, we intend to roll up our sleeves even further and continue our labours with renewed vigour.</p>
