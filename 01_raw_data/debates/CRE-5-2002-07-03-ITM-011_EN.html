<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the South-East Atlantic is one of the last areas of the world's oceans where there is no regional fisheries organisation. It was to fill this need that the new Convention on the Conservation and Management of Fishery resources in the South-East Atlantic Ocean was agreed in April 2001, which will create the South-East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO). So far only Namibia has ratified the convention. Hopefully Parliament's vote tomorrow will speed up ratification by the European Communities. Then only one more ratification would be needed before it enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of SEAFO is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources in the South-East Atlantic, beyond the national jurisdiction of Angola, Namibia and South Africa. It covers fish, molluscs, crustaceans and other sedentary species, but not highly migratory species which are covered by ICCAT.</p>
<p class="contents">The report provides some basic background material that I shall briefly cover here. The fish stocks of commercial importance at the present time include hake, horse mackerel, sardinella and anchovy. Most of these, however, are caught in national waters. The Commission suggests that any catches of these species in the high seas off the SEAFO area would be small. So what species will come under the management authority of SEAFO?</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas of the world, as fish stocks in coastal waters are progressively over-exploited and depleted, the fishing industry is turning more and more to deep water species. In many instances fisheries for these species are completely unregulated but the characteristics of these fish mean that they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation. They are extremely slow growing. They live for extremely long periods of time and with very limited distributions. History has repeatedly demonstrated that these fisheries operations are best described as fish-mining because the fish stocks have been depleted so rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the waters of the South-East Atlantic there are a number of stocks of deep water species, including Patagonian tooth fish, orange roughy, oreo, dory and deep-sea prawns. Only very preliminary information about the biology and the abundance of these species is yet available. That should already be cause for grave concern. However, the fact that management measures have recently been agreed for at least some deep-sea stocks in the Northeast Atlantic is encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report I mentioned a couple of areas, in which the test, while stronger than some earlier conventions, is actually weaker than the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. Probably one of the most important is the reference to the precautionary approach, which is significantly weaker than in the new convention signed recently for tuna fishing in the western Pacific. Details of this are contained in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand one commendable inclusion in the SEAFO Convention is the interim arrangements for monitoring, control and surveillance, which are to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not SEAFO meets the high expectations and ambitious objectives remains to be seen. The success of any regional fisheries organisation depends entirely upon the political will of the contracting parties. In that sense I have some worries about the behaviour of the European Union. Unfortunately, and much to the shame of the European Union, there have been numerous examples, spanning many years and in several organisations, where the European Union has not abided by the scientific advice of the Regional Fisheries Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense the historical record is not cause for optimism that the EU will do all in its considerable power to promote conservation of fisheries resources in the South-East Atlantic. I hope that there is a change of mind in the European Union on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the new SEAFO every success in managing its fisheries. I hope that the EU acts as a constructive force in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As stated by Mrs McKenna, who I warmly congratulate on her report, the body will organise and manage an area in which the Community fleet fishes and in which we also have fisheries relations with the coastal countries. As part of SEAFO, the Community will be able to contribute to research and to the adoption of measures to conserve stocks, applying high levels of responsible management to fishing, as laid down in the International Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage the Commission and the Council to ensure that the Community participates in all the existing regional fisheries organisations and in those to be formed in future, in the interests of the Community fisheries sector, as the European Parliament requested of them in its resolution on the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point to two problems: the first arises from the fact that RFOs do not have a weighted voting system, so the Community is therefore disadvantaged by only having a single vote, like a micro-State that is a contracting party; and the second is the long deadlines for the transposal into Community law of the binding agreements for the Community, adopted within these regional organisations. The administrative procedures need to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the Commission to thoroughly prepare its position before attending meetings of the SEAFO and the other RFOs, by consulting the sector. This requires good communication and relations between the Commission and the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not miss this opportunity to express my concern over an idea put forward by the Commission in its proposal for the reform of the common fisheries policy where it indicates, with regard to RFOs, that the Community should only intervene in cases of real interest to the Community fisheries sector. What does the Commission mean by real interest? I think this self-imposed restriction is particularly damaging to the principles of responsible fishing recommended by the Community, which the latter should advocate in all fora, in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty, which states that the Community policy in this field will contribute to “promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems”.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Community’s presence and leadership in the RFOs are necessary both in order to safeguard the sustainability of resources in European and non-European waters equally – as stated by the Commission itself – and in order to ensure that due account is taken of the interests of nations that practise distant-water fishing, in the same way that account is taken of the interests of coastal States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore asks the Commission, within the SEAFO and the other RFOs, to coordinate Community policies as a whole, and vice versa, for the Commission also to coordinate all its policies to defend the interests of the Community fleet worldwide, because only in this way will European fishermen be adequately protected. The Commission department dedicated to RFOs must therefore be given sufficient financial and human resources to be able to carry out these duties successfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also an urgent need to ensure the survival of human activities that will disappear if our waters are brutally exploited and depleted. No marine resource must be subjected to predatory activities, and it is therefore surprising that a maritime area as huge as the South-East Atlantic is not covered by the discipline and the management of any organisation. We consequently welcome the Convention creating a regional fisheries organisation for this area of the Atlantic high seas, which was concluded, as a matter of fact, in April 2001 by the main coastal States and by other States with an interest. The proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Fishery Resources in the South-East Atlantic Ocean therefore deserves our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the possibility that the species covered will be highly vulnerable as a result of their biological make up and the environment in which they live. The rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, was right to table only one amendment and, whilst making some points of criticism, to welcome the Convention. We agree with her and thank her for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These efforts have paid off, for the Convention is about to be ratified by the Community. Since we joined the negotiations on the Convention in 1997, the Community has taken an active role in them and will now be one of the first parties to ratify the Convention. We will thus be making a key contribution to its speedy entry into force. The progress towards this Convention was an outstanding example of positive and pro-active multilateral cooperation in the field of international fishing. This Convention implements the latest developments in maritime law, and it is living proof of every participant's commitment to responsible fishing in a maritime region where stocks are extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to emphasise three points. Firstly, the Convention establishes a good system of monitoring and control of fishing in this region. Secondly, it establishes a good balance in the allocation of fishing rights between coastal states and developing countries. Thirdly, the Convention has adopted the dispute settlement mechanism provided for by international maritime law. SEAFO thus has every chance of becoming an effective organisation for the responsible management of resources and resolutely combating illegal, unregistered and unregulated fishing, and it will be of benefit to a number of coastal states whose economies are heavily dependent on these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to your amendment, Mrs McKenna, which the Commission can only support. It is a fact that the UN Agreement came into force without being ratified by the Community. The Council decision of 1998 provided for speedy ratification by the Community and the Member States simultaneously. However, three Member States have yet to complete their internal procedures to ratify the Agreement. This is impeding the Community's progress towards membership of the UN Agreement. I myself have actively intervened personally in the Council and with the Member States to speed up this process.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your further concerns, namely that we should take account of the vulnerability of fish stocks, especially deep-water species – as you have already mentioned – within SEAFO's sphere of application, and that the Community must lobby harder for the widespread use of the precautionary approach in SEAFO's management of these stocks – these I can only endorse. I can assure you, Mrs McKenna, that the Community will continue to take an active role in SEAFO's work. In our Commission communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy, we made it clear that we are very keen to promote cooperation between all coastal states in the interests of sustainable and responsible fishing outside territorial waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
