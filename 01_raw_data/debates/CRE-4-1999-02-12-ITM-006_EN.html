<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission deeply regrets the heavy losses suffered by the Scottish salmon‐farming industry due to the presence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA). This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of the fragile market situation for salmon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services are following very closely the evolution of the disease and the measures taken by the UK authorities to combat the disease. We trust that the measures taken are in compliance with EU legislation. These measures impose compulsory slaughter at infected sites and movement restrictions on suspected farms. We are concerned about the consequences of both the disease and the eradication policy for the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I draw your attention, therefore, to the possibilities that exist under Community legislation for Member States to grant national financial aid in case of disease outbreaks in the aquaculture sector. Any request to the Commission from the competent authorities in the UK to establish a compensation scheme will be examined rapidly. Provided such a request meets the required criteria under the present rules for approval by the Commission, we will not hesitate to act accordingly. We further believe that the disease is so serious and its presence puts such a heavy burden on the future of salmon farming in the Community, that eradication of the disease is justified. If this policy proves unsuccessful, we could, of course, consider submitting proposals to change this policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, it is very apt that Commissioner Bangemann is taking this speech at the end of the week. He may remember a previous occasion when he and I had an exchange of views about the Commission's position, after I had spoken to Scottish farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome wholeheartedly the Commission's views. It is a very serious issue in the Scottish farming industry. It is a disease which started in Norway and has affected several farms in Scotland. It started off in Glen Nevis in a fish farm in the Highlands. It is extremely serious indeed coupled with the threat from the Norwegian government dumping salmon within the European Union at prices which threaten the livelihood of many salmon industries. In Scotland and Ireland we have about 6 000 people employed in aquaculture. It is important that we ensure that the type of chemicals that the salmon industry uses are not harmful to the marine environment. As in all fishing policy we have to marry the exploitation of resources with the proper treatment of the environment and conservation of stocks, although the salmon farming world would obviously not want to conserve the stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commissioner's statement. This week my own government has very generously committed itself to offer GBP 9 million – GBP 3 million a year over a three year period – to assist the salmon farmers. They are asking for matching funds and it is going to be administered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the industry itself. This follows on from discussions which the Scottish office has had with the industry. I welcome the fact that the Commission is not going to stand in the way of Member States because the second major condition is that the EU competition policy allow these salmon farmers to benefit from this assistance. This is particularly important, given the ownership of many of the salmon farms in Scotland by Norwegian companies. Indeed in the Shetland Islands, 50 % of the salmon industry is owned by Norway so it is extremely important that the Commission does not stand in the way and responds, as the Commissioner very generously promised, extremely rapidly to the moves and to any approaches from the Scottish office. I will be contacting Callum McDonald and John Sewell immediately after this meeting urging them to put in a quick request to the Commission.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virrankoski </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission for the vigour it has exercised in tackling this issue of salmon in Scotland. Meanwhile, I would like to point out that Scotland is not the only region to have suffered from salmon diseases, which are partly due to the very efficient breeding of salmon in nets, as practised in Norway. Stocks of salmon are under threat in Finland too as a result of this sort of intensive farming, particularly as the dreaded salmon parasite has spread to the waters of southern and central Norway. It has spread north up as far as the Skibotn river, and therefore to the top of the arm of Finland, as it appears on the map, and the Tenojoki river is under imminent threat. The Tenojoki is Europe"s longest salmon river. The Finnish authorities have been involved in intensive talks with their Norwegian counterparts, but no solution has been found for the protection of natural salmon stocks in the Tenojoki river. An added danger is the net breeding that is practised by the Norwegians in the Teno fiord. On the one hand, it threatens the genes of the salmon in the Tenojoki and their future survival in Europe"s northernmost salmon river, and, on the other, the spread of the salmon parasite threatens the whole salmon stock in the Tenojoki. I would hope that the European Commission will embark on vigorous action to save the salmon stock in the European Union"s longest salmon river for future generations and prevent it from being sacrificed on the altar of intensive fish farming.</p>

Previous outbreaks occurred in Norway and Canada, and now Scotland is affected. These situations arise because large numbers of salmon regularly escape from fish farms. Last year, for example, at least 70 tonnes of salmon disappeared from a fish farm near Oban. To make matters worse, we happen to know that the presence of infectious anaemia was suspected at this particular site. I believe it is only a matter of time until the disease spreads to wild salmon too – in which case we really will have serious problems, given that wild salmon stocks are already so depleted.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole host of problems surround aquaculture and salmon farming in general. All aspects of the question need to be brought together; perhaps a thorough investigation of the whole practice of aquaculture is now called for. I wonder whether the Commission would support such an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Another parasite called <span class="italic">gyrodactylus sallaris</span> is also present in Scandinavian waters. Norway recently came forward with a plan to treat 20 rivers with rotenone. That was an extreme decision, since such toxic treatment also extinguishes all other forms of life. What a desperate attempt to get to grips with this parasite!</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps Commissioner Bangemann could tell me whether the Commission is aware of the presence of this parasite in fish in Scotland, Ireland or elsewhere.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hudghton </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his helpful statement and for his recognition of the fragility of the salmon market and for the concern he expressed about the consequences of this disease for the hard‐pressed fish‐farming industry, particularly in Scotland, where it is of vital economic importance to areas such as the Highlands and Islands where there is very little alternative employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Around the coastline some 340 salmon farms are supporting some 6 000 jobs in some of the most rural areas of Europe. It is an industry that is well organised and well managed, but it is in crisis due to infectious salmon anaemia. This disease, which is a kind of salmon ‘flu, was exotic to the European Union until it first appeared in Scotland in May 1998, since when millions of healthy fish from just ten affected farms have had to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">ISA has been known to cause very high mortalities in farmed salmon cages, but it is a disease that cannot affect human beings and it does not render the affected fish inedible. European Union directives as well as UK regulations aim for eradication. However, the eradication policy does not address the social and economic consequences of the destruction of millions of fish. The reality is that mass destruction brings with it the prospect of financial ruin for many of the small family firms which are involved. It can destroy the whole financing of smaller enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this issue was put on Parliament's agenda, the Secretary of State for Scotland has acted, recognising the employment consequences. As Mr McMahon said, the government has promised GBP 9m over three years, but this being on a matched funding basis with the industry, it is now under negotiation. It may not be possible for the small farms to meet the matched funding and so what sounds generous may, in fact, for some small enterprises be meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Banks have indicated that they will not lend on the security of fish stocks, so unless the larger companies are prepared to act as a financial umbrella, it is difficult to see how the offer will stave off financial ruin for these small firms. The big companies might be able to buy up the small ones, but in many cases it is the small companies which have a fine investment record in our rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Norway has tacked this problem with a policy of containment rather than slaughter and the question must be asked whether consideration should be given in the European Union to alternative methods of combating the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that we take action. Scottish salmon farms are standing at a critical juncture, with decisions on buying next year's smolts now imminent. It is essential that urgent consideration be given to what further measures, including compensation, may be possible to assist the small‐scale enterprises I have referred to. I cannot emphasise enough the seriousness of this situation. Swift and determined action is essential if we are to avoid the severe consequences being felt in some of Europe's most economically vulnerable communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, may I ask you to confirm whether you would be prepared to consider the introduction of a Community‐funded eradication programme should the current national proposals fail?</p>
