<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, after two and a half years of consultations, discussions and conferences, we have reached the point today when the Commission can table a new directive to replace the Television Without Frontiers Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this directive necessary? Quite simply because of multimedia convergence. There are a multitude of platforms, wavebands, cables, satellites, ADSLs and mobiles delivering the same content, whether it be traditional scheduled television or on-demand services. The problem is that this extremely rapid development has not been followed by development of the law. It is unjust, and it distorts competition, to regulate some operators and not others. It is unacceptable to provide some with legal protection and deny it to others. It is not right to allow some to benefit from the advantages of the single market and deny those advantages to others. The aim of the new directive is therefore to compare like with like and afford them equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently observing a veritable explosion of platforms and content. You may remember that, when the Television Without Frontiers Directive was first adopted in 1989, there were 10 satellite channels; today, there are 2 500. After digitisation there will certainly be an explosion in the range of available content. The new services, of which there are 50 at the present time, are growing fast. Even though video on demand still plays a relatively minor role, experts tell us that, if the rules permit the development of that type of service, 22 million households will be connected to a video-on-demand service by 2010, generating an annual turnover in excess of EUR 2 billion. We are at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy here, with the opportunity to strengthen our European content industry, with all its implications for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive I wish to present to you today does not focus on the media through which information is transmitted but on content; it deals with audiovisual services, whatever medium is used to deliver them to the public. How, then, shall we regulate this range of content? First of all, there will be a distinction between two types of content. The first is the type we know, the service to which we are accustomed, namely our traditional scheduled television content, a menu which others have put together. We have no option but to accept what they provide or switch off. The second type of content is non-linear (on-demand) content, where consumers search for, select and retrieve what they regard as important and interesting. These two means of bringing content to people, linear and non-linear, will be regulated differently.</p>
<p class="contents">But – and this is a big ‘but’ – although there are two types of content, a balance must be maintained between the industrial dimension – I have already referred to the creation of European content – the European values that must not be sacrificed to this new type of content, the protection of consumers, particularly minors, which is important whatever the type of content, and, of course, the cultural diversity to which we are committed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore strike a balance between these factors while applying the principle of better regulation. We shall achieve this by what I call the ‘light-touch approach’. What do I mean by ‘light-touch’? First of all, there will be a set of minimum requirements for all types of content. These requirements include the identification of the provider; in other words, people must know who put the message on the medium. They also include identifiable advertising: no surreptitious advertising but strict rules governing the advertising that appears with content. Then there is the protection of human dignity. It would be unacceptable, for example, for particular types of content to be immune to measures designed to combat incitement to racial or religious hatred. Similarly, it would be unacceptable if the protection of minors did not apply to all types of content. Moreover, Parliament and all the other defenders of European culture could not accept a situation in which the European identity and European cultural diversity were promoted in one type of content but not in another. These, then, are the common rules for both linear and non-linear content.</p>
<p class="contents">So what about the specific rules that apply to conventional scheduled television, which needs to be more rigorously regulated, given its powerful influence and the absence of consumer choice? The rules that will remain in place cover quotas, the right of reply and access to events of major importance. The rules that will be altered in part and preserved in part relate to the way we deal with advertising. First of all, the rules governing the quality of advertising will be the same as in the current directive. The rules governing the volume of advertising will change, partly because simplified and updated rules are needed in this new multimedia world and partly because it is not up to the Commission to do the work of programme planners. This is why there will no longer be daily limits, why commercial breaks will not be so heavily regulated as they are today and why isolated commercials will be permitted in sports programmes, though not in other programmes. On the other hand, we have no wish to see television programmes awash with advertising, and for this reason we are maintaining some important ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these rules is the twelve-minute limit. The advertising explosion that is sometimes depicted in the press will not take place: commercial breaks will remain limited to a total of twelve minutes in any hour. There will also be safeguards relating to the interruption of films, TV movies, children’s programmes and news programmes, which will be subject to a limit of one break in each 35-minute segment. This is very important. For example, the fact that children will be better protected in future than is presently the case with traditional television programmes and that they will also be protected in the case of non-linear services is a major advance. It may therefore be said that, while relaxing the rules for adults, we are also tightening them for the protection of young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important element that was conceived from the perspective of the funding of content is the authorisation, subject to very restrictive and strict conditions, of product placement. In Europe today, we actually have conflicting rules on product placement. In one country there are no rules, in another the rules relate only to national content, and in a third there is a total ban.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, so that the rules are the same for everyone and so that consumers are well informed, which is not the case under the present system, product placement must comply with very strict rules. It will be authorised if there is a guarantee that the viewer will be made aware of the placement. The rules should guarantee legal certainty and equality of treatment for all content. Importantly, however, there will also be major restrictions: no placement of children’s products and no product placement in news and current-affairs programmes or in documentaries. The purpose of these rules is to safeguard our children and protect the editorial freedom of journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive contains a vast number of new features, and it would take too long for me to list them all, but I know Parliament, and I know that these matters will be revisited in the course of the next few months. There are, however, three new elements I should like to highlight. The first is the non-discriminatory right to use short extracts for the purposes of general news programming. Secondly, this is the first European directive that explicitly authorises the use of coregulation and self-regulation at the national level. The third new feature which I believe to be of great importance with regard to the implementation of this directive is the establishment of national audiovisual regulators who will be independent of their respective governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like the Commissioner to confirm that it will continue to be called the Television Without Frontiers Directive, in modernised form. I believe the original proposal for a name was very confusing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like ask the Commissioner whether she thinks she is being radical enough, given the pace of technology. Having seen a number of developments – including when we were together in Tunis recently – it is my view that that the distinction between linear and non-linear is getting more and more blurred and that more and more consumers are going to access what were traditional broadcast programmes at whatever time they want, as they will be stored automatically on their digital video recorders. Indeed, we will be carrying them to Parliament in our iPods or whatever other digital mechanism we use. So does the Commissioner really think that this is radical enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I noted that she said she was looking for a light-touch approach, a lack of red tape and technological neutrality, all of which are principles of the excellent Communications Framework Directive we have now, which is vitally important. Does the Commissioner believe that she has the right balance of these in this directive and that it will stand the test of time in the way that the Communications Framework Directive already has? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also, you state that it does not apply to children’s or youth programmes, but I am at a loss as to know, on the basis of the communication, whether it includes on-demand content. Should that loophole be closed or does the ban on product replacement apply across the range of children’s and youth programmes, including on-demand content?

However, I think it will become ‘audiovisual without frontiers’. The linear and non-linear division is fairly clear. We will have an opportunity to discuss these definitions later in our various committee meetings, as I made very clear in the text of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I chose to use a light-touch approach to provide an opportunity for these media to develop. I shall give you a very simple example. Today video on demand is not developing very quickly for the simple reason that there are 25 regulations for that kind of service. Therefore, if you are developing this service in one country and would like to export it to another, you have to develop a new service for the new country, which means that the internal market is not functioning any more.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to provide this opportunity for these services to operate in the internal market and develop, because I believe that video on demand will offer an extraordinary chance not only for new entrants on the VOD market but also in bringing our European content and films to the consumer. It is evident that the European film industry has distribution problems and difficulties in getting its products seen by the public – either there is no cinema or the cinema does not carry the European content. Video on demand is a real opportunity to bring the European product to the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr Belet, product placement is part of the basic set of common requirements, which means that the rules governing product placement, including those relating to young people, apply to both linear and non-linear programming.</p>
<p class="contents">If you analyse the new directive, you will see very clearly that I have done my utmost to protect our young people, because the availability of so much content on so many platforms makes them vulnerable and they therefore need protection. This is also a matter I hope to discuss with the Members of this House. How far should we go to protect our young people? Have I done too much, or have I not done enough? This is a question for us to discuss. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mrs Harms asked whether more product placement adds something as regards content; well, yes, I believe it does. Nowadays, we have the problem that product placement is almost everywhere, but is illegal in some countries. In others, it is illegal only in respect of domestic products, not those from neighbouring countries. Product placement for US products is everywhere, and thus product placement now appears on our television screens – even if it is prohibited at national level – without the consumer realising. Firstly, the new legislation will introduce horizontal Europe-wide legislation that permits product placement where this is important, namely for the purpose of funding our European content industry, our films, so that they have the same opportunities, including with regard to funding, as films from other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are currently no rules to the effect that product placement – for children, for example – must be prohibited in various kinds of content. It is unbelievable that such a thing is happening across the board in children’s programmes. Children, unlike adults, are defenceless against this. That is why it is important to have horizontal prohibition of product placement for children. As a former journalist – since you mention it – I have discussed the influence of product placement on information and on information-type programmes at length with my journalist colleagues and have come to the conclusion that a full ban on product placement for information and in information-type programmes is desirable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The review of the directive and the enlargement of its scope to non-linear media must not result in the watering down of its regulatory arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The safeguarding of the principle of cultural diversity and pluralism is necessary, irrespective of the medium by which the audiovisual content is transmitted.</p>

<p class="contents">We need to strengthen the arrangements in the directive relating to advertising and the protection of minors. It more or less says that the existing regime will remain. We cannot put the interests of the industry before viewers' rights and the quality of television, nor can we expect the market to regulate these important issues on its own.

Parliament has asked that the issue of pluralism be dealt with within the scope of this directive and on numerous occasions the Commission has said: this is a very delicate matter and we dare not — to put it in a simplified fashion — deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this directive, in the preparations for the discussion we are going to hold from now on in Liverpool, an issues paper was entirely dedicated to the issue of pluralism, an issue that causes great concern. The Commission’s view has always been, ‘look, when industry is liberalised, pluralism will follow automatically’. But that is not true. It is not true because in the world of radio and the world of television we are subject to a system of administrative franchises and there is interference by public powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, I am going to tell you about something that is happening in our country and which has no precedent in the European Union: 500 000 Spanish citizens, more than half a million Spanish citizens — something which has never before happened in the European Union, in any of its institutions — are supporting an initiative to prevent a public power, the Government of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, from closing a radio station. Surely that is important and is of interest to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this precedent, I would ask you: Mrs Reding, is the issue of pluralism going to be dealt with in this directive? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also thank her for the lovely phrase ‘a fitness programme for the audiovisual media’. I think that that will become a popular quotation in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing self-regulation is a means of implementing the directive, which itself constitutes a legal framework that the national authorities must transpose into national law. As regards implementation, however, they have the opportunity of either going still further than this framework or – provided there is the necessary acceptance among stakeholders – doing so by means of controlled self-regulation. It is correct that this is the first time that this terminology has appeared in a European legislative text. I believe that placing trust in the experts working in the field is an important step in the right direction. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr Sifunakis, the chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, asked me why he had not been informed until the last minute. Mr Sifunakis, I myself was only told early this afternoon that the Commission had accepted my proposals. Today it has been a matter of informing Parliament, not of debating the issue. I am sure that the debate itself will be very intensive; it will be long, and I imagine it will begin next year in the relevant committees, namely the Committee on Culture and Education and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that worked well in the Television Without Frontiers Directive has been reproduced in the new directive. I have not compromised the quotas – quite the contrary. As far as online services are concerned, I have imposed an obligation to promote European works, an instrument that does not exist at the present time. The percentage provided by independent producers remains in place, and consumer protection is reinforced, because we need well-informed consumers who know what awaits them. In short, consumer information and the protection of consumers against abuses are maintained, and not only in the sphere of traditional television, because these principles also apply to the new services.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Herrero wondered whether the pluralism of the media was still guaranteed in a world where changes took place every day. One need only read the newspapers from all parts of Europe for reassurance on that score: new mergers take place, existing groups break up, and new media services are created. Digitisation will generate an explosion of channels available to the public, not to mention the new forms of video on demand. What other inventions are set to appear in the near future? The consumer will be faced with an enormously wide choice, which is a good way to develop pluralism. The more choice available to the consumer, the more pluralism will develop. For this reason, we must do everything we can to foster consumer choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity is also a very important aspect of pluralism, and the extension of such diversity to the new services is an important step towards pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of next year, my departments will publish a document on the national rules relating to media concentrations. I had promised you such a document to enable us – the Commission and Parliament – to take a joint look at the direction in which we are heading. It will be on the table at the start of next year. We shall then have the opportunity to debate its content and any action that needs to be taken at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The enhancement of European content will meet with ample support, and two readings will give us sufficient time to then discuss this in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Variety is Europe’s strength – we cannot compete with the US market there, nor do we want to – but it is of course also its weakness. In my opinion, we cannot have product placement in films in the same way as the US. After all, the market always determines the way products are represented in films. There are no objections to a person driving a car, but when it comes to a situation where product placement is only available to those with the fattest wallets, something has gone wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that advertising has no place in children’s programmes. It is only the boundaries that are blurred; that much is clear. Where should the boundaries be drawn? I think that, once the door is opened to this, it will no longer be possible to contain it. Therefore, there will be very great resistance to product placement and the blurred boundaries.

<p class="contents">Variety is very important, and because it is important, and because I should like to see European films and European television broadcasts shown off to their best advantage on our TV screens, mobile phones and computers, I shall do everything possible to promote it. In fact, some Member States are already doing this. Let me take as an example the Austrian law on product placement: that is a very sensible law, and it is working very well. Mrs Gröner mentioned advertising during children’s programmes. Perhaps I did not make it sufficiently clear that product placement during children’s programmes will be prohibited. That is going one step further than is currently possible in very many Member States. I wish to protect children in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Trüpel spoke about editorial independence. This is very important to me, and that is why I have made particular reference to the subject.
