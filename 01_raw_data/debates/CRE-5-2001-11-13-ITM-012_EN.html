It is an excellent analysis of our energy supply situation in Europe. I thank all my colleagues for the way in which they have contributed to my report to bring it to this stage this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main points in the Green Paper. Firstly, the European Union will become increasingly dependent on external energy sources, reaching 70% by 2003. Secondly, the EU has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions so that it is on the demand side that the EU can intervene, mostly through promoting energy saving in buildings and in the transport sector. Thirdly, in present circumstances the EU is not in a position to respond to the challenge of climate change and to meet its commitments, notably under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing above all else is staring us in the face: the massive dependence on oil and on imported oil in particular. For commonsense reasons of security of supply and protection of the environment, urgent steps should be taken to address this disproportionate dependence. We cannot alter the fact of where the oil comes from, but we can do a number of things on the demand side, particularly in the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Being dependent on imports is not necessarily a bad thing or economically inefficient, provided that the sources are diverse, no one supplier is dominant and we can produce sufficient goods and services to pay for them. The Commission is correct to focus on demand management measures as a first priority and it is to be hoped that the Member States will pursue this approach vigorously. However I do not accept the view that little or nothing can be done on the supply side. In four areas the EU and Member States can be masters of their own destiny and make a real difference, both to security of supply and to protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Renewable energy sources are by definition indigenous supplies and we are correct to seek to increase their share of final consumption and electricity generation. However let us be realistic,. Even if the ambitious targets for RES are met, they cannot be expected to replace any of the other energy sources completely or become the sole supplier of all our energy needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear energy is not popular in some quarters, but it supplies more electricity in Europe than any other energy source. It provides large volume, base load power and produces hardly any greenhouse gas emissions. It is a safe and secure European technology, operated under stringent standards of regulation. To deliberately deny ourselves this major source of electricity seems perverse in the absence of an alternative source of supply that can provide an equivalent volume.</p>
<p class="contents">Coal is a source of energy in decline in Europe, because of cost and environmental concerns. Yet it is an important indigenous resource which could be given a new lease of life with new technology to make it more efficient and less pollutant. Furthermore, there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems, if the industry can seize the opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth area is research work for future technologies and energy systems. That is something Europe must do in order to safeguard future security of supply, employment and technology. It seems obvious but needs repeating.</p>
<p class="contents">For all the above reasons, I also disagree with the view that the EU cannot meet its Kyoto commitments. What is needed is realism on the nuclear issue, determined effort on clean coal technology, much encouragement of RES and coordinated demand management measures, as well as a sustained effort to inform public opinion about the necessity to stop wasting energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This document represents the first great step in Europe’s energy strategy; it offers a global view of the situation and raises all the relevant issues in this sector without reservations or conditions. It states that our main problem is our supply, characterised by great external dependence, which will increase over the coming decades.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not leave aside environmental issues, however, which are inseparable from energy use. In this respect, the directive adopted on renewable energy sources and the proposal on the promotion of biofuels are going to lead to great progress in terms of the diversification of the supply of clean energy, but they are not the solution in either the short or medium terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not hinder any type of energy, above all if it does not produce CO2 emissions. The solutions, as the Commission points out very well, involve the diversification of supply sources, especially clean sources – those which do not produce greenhouse gases. We must insist on technological research into energy sources, energy saving and the liberalisation of the gas sectors, in order that we may create a genuine internal energy market. Furthermore, it would be good if the Treaties could include a chapter on energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This strategy is based on three complementary objectives, which I support: to reduce the European Union’s energy consumption by improving efficiency in certain sectors, particularly the construction and automobile industries; greater cooperation and investment for supplying countries, the diversification of energy resources with what I consider to be an essential objective: to reduce our dependency on oil.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that this report explains how these objectives are to be achieved, namely by liberalising the energy sector, and I should like to reiterate the need not to give in to populist rhetoric, especially where renewable energies and nuclear energy are concerned. We must remain realistic and understand that, without the contribution made by nuclear energy, the European Union will not be able to reach the objectives it has set for itself for reducing greenhouse gases. Compliance with the Kyoto criteria must be one of the European Union’s priority objectives. This is within our grasp if we demonstrate clear thinking in our choices and I also note that the options available in the field of taxation could prove to be powerful incentives, provided that they do not block the development of industry in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments by the group of the Greens are counter-productive. Instead of stimulating debate, they exclude from the outset various possibilities for energy choices and I feel they should be rejected so as to maintain the coherence of this report. I hope that we shall do so, following the recommendations of our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has. Thank you again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy. Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future. I believe that we should also express that in a positive way. Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station. I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto. A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world. For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been stated here on previous occasions, the EU has only limited possibilities to interfere with the terms and conditions of energy supply. Its chances of influencing the matter are restricted to the demand, and hence to the promotion of energy saving in the construction and transport industries. The most important things, therefore, are to ensure the diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of suppliers of energy. The availability of energy on a local level enhances the reliability of energy supplies, reduces dependence on imported energy and provides employment opportunities. In particular, research into and the use of renewable energy sources must be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for assuring the reliability of energy supplies is primarily a matter for national energy policies. In order to enhance the reliability of supplies, it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries. Also, energy projects that serve common European objectives are an excellent way of putting into specific terms the EU’s policies on the Northern Dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turmes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my own position and that of the Greens have been discussed at length in other forums, and it is not possible, in two and a half minutes to present a detailed argument. I shall, therefore, limit myself to asking the Commissioner a few questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important that this debate should be based on figures that are as precise as possible. Even at an early stage of the debate, it was clear that the various scenarios available to the Commission are not really ‘bottom up’ scenarios, for energy efficiency, for renewables, or for cogeneration. Furthermore, another problem is that, often, European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States. In this context, I should like to know whether the Commission has begun working on this type of scenario with a view to the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, energy efficiency is everyone’s birthright and everyone is insisting on this point. What is the Commission’s view today, in concrete terms, on the important actions to be taken in the field of energy efficiency? Parliament has put forward a number of alternatives, both in its Energy Intelligent Europe initiative, and in the action plan. Nevertheless, since October, I have not seen the Commission making a genuine, sustained effort on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this is a fundamental point, at the beginning of your presentation of the Green Paper, you promised us a real democratic debate. Today, however, I see that the national round tables have not been entirely transparent and that, at European level, we are still waiting for an open and transparent debate to be held, something that you announced at the beginning as being a key element. This is why I am asking you today, Commissioner, when will the round tables take place in civil society, amongst experts at European level? We have been hearing about them for the last six months, and we have yet to see one take place. I fail to see how the Commission can ensure that the Green Paper is followed up without organising these round tables. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does not mean, however, that the European Union should not do more to promote the use of alternative energies and safer and cleaner energies. It must also play a leading role in ensuring that all the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol are implemented. The broader international community has not covered itself in glory in the efforts to ensure that the depletion of the ozone layer is stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">This report refers to the fact that nuclear energy in Europe will be playing a less significant role, following the decisions by five Member States to phase out the use of nuclear energy in the future. It also states that no country in Europe is currently constructing new nuclear reactors. It would be greatly appreciated in Ireland if you would inform the British Government and BNFL of this fact. The British Government is currently planning the expansion, not a reduction, of nuclear activities at Sellafield. The MOX facility at Sellafield means more nuclear reprocessing, not less, and nobody in the British Government and BNFL can deny this.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland we are sick and tired of BNFL breaching so-called high standards of regulation in their nuclear operations. We cannot easily forget that BNFL falsified documents in relation to nuclear reprocessing contracts with the Japanese Government. Where are the stringent standards of regulation, when you are dealing with a company that has falsified documents and has been shown time and time again to operate its affairs in this very slipshod manner?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that BNFL is technically insolvent. Its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste will be up to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235m worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheet. What is the economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone the expansion of its nuclear operations in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Are the British people fully aware of the extent of movements of nuclear materials by rail and sea in Britain? In Ireland we are very concerned about the security arrangements at Sellafield in the light of the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September. What assurances can the British Government give the people of Ireland that maximum security operates in the region? We know the type of devastation that would occur if a twin towers type attack were to take place at Sellafield. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It deals with an acute problem, one directly linked with the world political situation, which is more extensively unpredictable than ever. Despite the very large number of good statements, I cannot share the rapporteur's view that nuclear energy is a practical alternative to energy imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons are well known. Only recently, a study was completed, commissioned by Parliament, which comes to the conclusion that the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield discharge as much radioactivity over seven years as was emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste has not been resolved. Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution. It therefore makes more sense to invest in safe and renewable energy sources than in nuclear fusion, which can achieve results in 100 years at best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within this good policy, the Green Paper provides a detailed and consistent analysis of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper provides four fundamental messages: the message that there is excessive risk associated with dependence on external sources beyond a reasonable limit; the message that it will be impossible to comply with the Kyoto objectives if we remain bogged down in inertia and do not introduce corrective measures; the message that we have little room for manoeuvre in terms of supply policies and we must concentrate our efforts on demand policies; and the message that we need to provide our energy policy with a genuinely European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this good policy goes further than diagnosis, because the Commission demonstrates that analysis and action can be simultaneous; and in Parliament at the moment we have the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, the directive on transport, the directive on the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market and the regulation on cross-border exchanges of electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we must congratulate the Commissioner and I will not end without also expressly congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his well-considered report and his receptiveness to the work of his colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Honourable Member of the Commission, I propose that the Commission take swift measures in order to get this northern gas to balance our energy situation.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite. I should like to ask, therefore, why peat, although it renews itself by a millimetre every year, has been completely forgotten; but then, peat is a type of vegetation found in poorer areas, while lignite is found in wealthier ones! Nevertheless, peat is an important fuel component in remote areas, and it is also a regional fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Forty per cent of all energy is spent in buildings, to heat them, to provide water, air-conditioning and lighting for them. Already, during the previous energy crisis, we in Finland had to make modifications to buildings and we have managed to achieve good results in severe conditions. We must greatly enhance energy efficiency in buildings because that is where there really is a great deal of room for improvement. We shall have to gradually get accustomed to twilight conditions, for example. It is great to live in semi-darkness and not always in the sunshine, in artificial light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unless we show a solid political will to implement this self-sufficiency, our future lies in the direction of energy dependency. If we allow things to continue the way they are, in 25 years’ time, the European Union’s dependency on external sources of energy will reach 70% rather than the 50% we have today. This realisation is what underlies the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to remain masters of our destiny, we must give priority to action on two fronts. We must, on the one hand, encourage energy savings wherever possible. On the other hand, we must make good use of our advantages, our skills and our resources.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, and as the Green Paper and our rapporteur suggest, in a realistic rather than an ideological way, we should address the issue of developing nuclear energy. This would require acknowledging that this form of energy cannot be faulted in terms of creating greenhouse gases but also that intensive research efforts are absolutely crucial if we are to make waste end products completely harmless, even if they only exist in low volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">Blaming reprocessing processes, as the WISE report, commissioned by the STOA and of highly dubious scientific merit, has done once again, will not help us find a solution. Instead of allowing their technological lead to stagnate, the European countries should capitalise on it, particularly by focusing their research on improving reprocessing and recycling techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">The same research effort must be made in the field of biofuels, which have the merit of representing a major indigenous source of energy for us: these are non-polluting and offer promising outlets for our farming.

Not only does it meet our energy and economic requirements, but it also meets our environmental requirements under Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say – and Mr Chichester's excellent report bears this out – that unless we diversify our sources of supply of energy, especially by promoting indigenous supplies of energy, we will be in trouble with our economy and our jobs in the future. Nuclear energy must play a significant part in both those ambitions: diversification and indigenous supplies. There are other areas as well. Mr Chichester mentioned coal. We must promote clean technologies in coal.</p>
<p class="contents">In my part of the world, in Scotland, we would like to see more emphasis on promoting the oil and gas industries and their potential for better recovery systems, for exploration in marginal areas, for developing marginal oil and gas fields, for replenishing the reserves, the reservoirs in the south part of the North Sea, with gas in the meantime to protect us for the long term, and particularly transmission systems. That applies not only to oil and gas but also to electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these areas there is great potential for research. That ties us into what we will discuss tomorrow in the Caudron report on the Sixth Framework Programme.

Next I wish to stress that I entirely support the approach of Mr Chichester, who is proposing both a diversification of energy sources and the development of all current sources without exception. These proposals do, of course, make calls for liberalisation that I would probably have rejected had they appeared in isolation.

Very rarely have I seen reports on energy of this calibre. The Commission Green Paper was already first-rate, but with this supplement I believe we have many sound building blocks for the EU’s energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest concern, of course, is, as Mr Chichester rightly points out, our energy dependence and the question ‘what can be done about it?’ In my view, therefore, the well-balanced package in the Chichester report offers an excellent helping hand. That means that one should not only consider natural oil and gas supplies, but also new forms of energy. That one should consider renewable energy sources, but that one should not immediately rule out nuclear energy. Certainly with regard to the way in which its use can be made safer. That is certainly feasible, and a great deal needs to be done yet. One cannot say that nuclear energy is no longer acceptable, for then one gets into the greatest difficulty in Europe. Something must also be done about those aspects which give rise to questions, of course, and on that score too, a great deal can be done, partly by finding intelligent solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said time and again: if there is no energy chapter, then nothing can be done. Well, if I read Paragraph 21, which merely sums up all elements of the EU policy that can be achieved at the moment, that is an enormous agenda. On that score, our Commissioner has a great deal of work to do. Energy and geopolitical developments are closely related, particularly if we consider the developments after 11 September. I therefore hope that the energy charter will be ratified at the earliest opportunity and that we will further develop the Caspian Sea Basin, for in that way, we can also slightly reduce Europe’s dependence. I should like to finish off by congratulating both the Commissioner and our rapporteur on their sterling work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am aware of the scale of this challenge, given both the size and complexity of the issue itself and the number and diversity of the parties affected by it, inside and outside Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When I speak of the security of energy supply, I am not just referring to the physical supply, but also to energy systems and services which are ecologically, socially and economically sustainable. In this respect, the security of energy supplies is essential to our development and security in the broadest sense, and recent events have demonstrated this even more clearly. In fact, the tragic events of 11 September have highlighted our dependency on imports and the security of our installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk factor has multiplied overnight: the risk of premeditated damage to installations and infrastructures, the risk of volatility on the oil markets (with its prejudicial effect on the world economy) and the risk of interruption to our supply, both internal and external. All of this means that it is more important than ever to provide appropriate measures for responding in the event of emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging to note from the responses to the Green Paper – more than 150 formal responses from different organisations of all types – the interest in issues relating to the security of energy supply throughout Europe and beyond. I am pleased that the Commission’s analysis has received general support and that there is a considerable degree of awareness of the risks and problems faced by Europe in terms of guaranteeing the security of the energy supply and the international nature of those risks and problems. This is reflected in the excellent report you have before you.</p>
<p class="contents">Many respondents have accepted that it is no longer possible to view energy supply as being independent from economic and environmental objectives. Furthermore, a series of points in the report confirm that the European Parliament has clearly understood that there is a close link between these three objectives and the balance between them must be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">The responses also confirm that European public opinion shares the Commission’s desire to confront the problem of climate change. I am pleased to see that the European Parliament not only shares this concern, but that it has many ideas on the instruments which may help us to achieve this objective. We will carefully study these ideas when we prepare our response to the consultation on the Green Paper. I am not going to refer to it at the moment, but I would like to state very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue has given rise to debates in numerous national Parliaments, in some of which either I or high level officials from the Commission have participated, and in various universities, companies and non-governmental organisations, thanks, amongst other things, to the use of the Internet, which is a vehicle for openness within society, which, although not yet concluded, gives us an idea of the importance of this issue in all social fields of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially pleased to highlight the insistence on energy efficiency. Like you, I believe that there are huge areas for possible improvements. Your ideas are clear, in relation to the supply, in the context of the general recognition that there should be diversification of energy sources and supply origins.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report accepts, no individual source is completely lacking in drawbacks: they all have a cost and they all seem necessary. With regard to coal, we have no alternative but to maintain basically subsidised production, at least for a certain amount of time. In any event, the Commission’s proposed regulation confirms the importance we attach to own-production, but, above all, the importance of developing clean coal technology, which will allow us to use the only ample reserve of fossil fuel that the European Union has and promote the possibility of improving and reducing emissions internationally. In this way, furthermore, we will maintain cutting-edge technology which offers all sorts of possibilities for our industry.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to renewable energy sources, their importance will depend on the speed with which we can overcome a whole series of technical, social and economic obstacles. The renewable energies directive, in relation to electricity, offers a guide for the direction we should take. I know that we have been criticised for not making sufficient progress with this directive, but we are still trying to achieve our objective of doubling the percentage of renewable energy sources by the end of this decade. In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the previous intervention by Mr Souchet, we approved a few days ago an important and ambitious proposal on biofuels, which I hope will be approved and supported both by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to nuclear energy, I am very satisfied with the frank and constructive exchange of views which the presentation of the Green Paper has made possible. Some Member States have announced a moratorium or the progressive dismantling of their capacity for nuclear generation. But one Member State has clearly stated its intention to go ahead with nuclear energy and to build a new reactor. In any event, the abandonment of nuclear energy by some Member States may make a significant hole in our energy capacity and speed up the use of forms of energy generation which emit more greenhouse gases and, therefore, create problems in terms of our Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have total respect for the decisions taken by the Member States, naturally, I believe that in these circumstances it is very difficult to confront the problem of climate change if we maintain a diversified energy base. I believe that it is advisable to keep all the options open while the research into the management and elimination of waste is intensified and that is essentially the greatest problem with nuclear energy, given the progress made in terms of the safety of nuclear plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the Green Paper is still open. It is therefore premature to anticipate its final conclusions. However, the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to make proposals in the quest for new perspectives on energy supply. We are working with you and the Council on the internal market legislation relating to one of the pillars of our strategy, in terms of both gas and electricity. We must continue looking into the tax framework and pricing and, specifically, the guarantee of a mechanism for setting energy prices which reflects all the quantifiable external social and environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in this field, we will shortly present certain energy network interconnections which will further integrate the national markets and therefore strengthen the security of the whole market resulting from this integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I hope soon to present a proposal on the combined generation of heat and electricity, which will allow us to make progress in the battle for efficiency. Somebody said earlier that we have done little. But I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of a proposal on buildings, which is very important (buildings represent 40% of energy consumption, and there are margins for savings of almost 20%), the proposal we will present to improve the current regulation on combined generation of heat and electricity, and a general proposal, a framework proposal, which will provide measures for all types of electrodomestic or electrical equipment within buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to demand, the benefits of energy saving which have been raised are clear and, I insist, we have presented many serious, solid and important initiatives, and we are going to present those which I have just mentioned. With regard to transport and its effect on demand, the Commission makes a very detailed analysis in the White Paper, of which I have mentioned some important aspects when I spoke about the proposal on biofuels which was approved last week.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also clearly recognises the international nature of the challenges relating to energy supply. The increase in our dependency, not only on oil, but also on gas, makes it essential that we study the broader geopolitical repercussions of the current market situation. The Commission intends to produce a report on this issue next year; of course, we would like to use the opportunities offered by the Sixth research and development framework programme and the successor to the energy framework programme as instruments for supporting our strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the security of the energy supply is an inextricable element of a balanced social and economic development. The debate on the Green Paper has highlighted, as never before, the delicate interrelationship between energy needs, environmental objectives and balanced economic development. Many of the ideas presented in this report may be important elements in guaranteeing the security of our energy supply. As I have explained, some of them have already been implemented, but they are not yet a defined strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to establish a stable long-term framework to guarantee the security of energy supply, which can deal with changes in international economic and environmental circumstances, and which creates a firm basis for the future role of Europe on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this in mind, I would like to use the European Council in Barcelona next spring as a launch pad for a European strategy on energy supply, and you can rest assured that, in drawing up this strategy, the ideas contained in this report will be taken into account. I hope to have further opportunities to debate this idea with you.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester once again on his wonderful report and the work he has done. I also congratulate and thank Mrs Ayuso for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I thank everybody who has spoken on this report and this debate. I promise that we will continue working on it when the conclusions closing the general debate on the Green Paper produced by the Commission are finally presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
