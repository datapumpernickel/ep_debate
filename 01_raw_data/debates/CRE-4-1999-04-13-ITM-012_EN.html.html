<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lienemann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the only financial instrument the European Union has to intervene directly in the field of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE has been extremely successful because it is one of the Community programmes which give rise to many projects. In fact, there are many more projects than can be supported by the payment appropriations, and 98 % – even 100 % – of the appropriations are used. This instrument is original in that it benefits the guiding principles of environmental policy. The programme comprises three main components: LIFE‐Nature, LIFE‐Environment, and LIFE‐Third Countries. The breakdown of the appropriations is as follows: 47 % for LIFE‐Nature, 47 % for LIFE‐Environment, and 6 % for LIFE‐Third Countries.</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE‐Nature mainly accompanies the Community policies that are connected with the protection of the biotope, the conservation of wild species, the implementation of European directives – particularly the directive which protects migratory birds – or the Natura 2000 directive, and the protection of the natural habitats of different species of fauna and flora.</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE‐Environment is geared more towards what could be termed urban ecology and industrial practices, particularly practices and technologies which are said to be ‘clean". The actions implemented within this framework cover a wide range of areas from water policy to air pollution control. LIFE‐Third Countries provided an opportunity for applicant countries, enabling them to prepare to implement European environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This new programme encompasses various objectives. It is not a matter of radically changing its content; it is a matter of revising the corresponding regulation. The analysis of these programmes is very positive with regard to their impact and importance. Yet, along with the conclusions of the experts, it reveals that we need to give more consideration to the results, make greater use of the programme as an accompanying instrument when drawing up our rules and European policies, and, more generally, increase the total appropriations allocated to accompanying measures. These would include increasing awareness of the instrument and good practices, exchanging information and experience, and producing a summary report. That is why, generally speaking, the regulation states that the appropriations set aside for accompanying measures should be increased from 3 % to 5 %.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation itself seeks to redefine the priorities, bring them together and make them clearer for those involved. As a result, LIFE"s broad guidelines in each of the sectors have been somewhat tightened up. However, it has been proposed that guidelines should be introduced to help the authors of the projects make the specific priorities in each of the areas clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE is being implemented by the Commission"s services with the help of a management committee made up of Council representatives and with the help of experts. Given the numerous debates Parliament has had on the implementation of the budget for European programmes, I would stress that no technical assistance office was invoked in connection with this programme. These are technical experts who support the Commission"s services, and I think we all should be very pleased with the methodical and rigorous approach adopted by the Commission in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, our report and the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to some extent accompany the Commission"s broad guidelines. I hope that our amendments will be supported by the Commissioner and I should perhaps emphasise two points. The first is the hope that a more explicit reference will be made to sustainable development, and not just environmental policy. This is clearly an important change of concept, since it introduces a social dimension, that of human development. Secondly, we would like to see special attention paid to the issue of job creation. We sincerely hope that the new environmental practices and technologies will help generate employment. We would like LIFE to give greater consideration to the social impact involved, and to employment in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards budget allocations, which is a sensitive issue and always leads to heated debate, Mrs Marinucci, the rapporteur for LIFE II, had proposed to the House a sum of ECU 800 million over a period of four years, and we supported her on this. I am more modest than she was, since I am suggesting a sum of ECU 850 million over five years, which is a little less than what she wanted for each year, but a little more than what the Council had granted the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that Parliament will support this proposal. Some people will think it is a little modest, since more is required for certain amendments, and others will perhaps think it is too ambitious in view of the Union"s budgetary requirements. However, I feel that it is a happy medium which could earn the broad support of Parliament.</p>

The result is obvious: a high‐quality proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, I have limited my opinion to the external effects of the LIFE programme. The committee would have liked to see a slight shift in favour of the non‐Union countries taking part in this programme. Unfortunately, the rapporteur Mrs Lienemann was not prepared to agree to that in the Environment Committee. In any case, I hope that the budget for third countries will be spent in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee also asked for due account to be taken of cross‐border aspects. I see that reflected in a variety of amendments, mainly by the rapporteur. I am in favour of guarantees to protect the natural environment, because I have seen the destructive effects of other cross‐border projects. There is one such project in the Dutch province of Limburg. The cross‐border consideration must not be an overriding criterion. LIFE must be first and foremost an instrument of funding for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a footnote to one or two amendments tabled by the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I do not think that the resources will be used in the best way possible if all her amendments are adopted. I am surprised that the Environment Committee has agreed to some additions which seek to use this instrument to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have my doubts about the concept of sustainable development. At first sight this seems a very environmentally friendly concept, but it is being used here as a means of achieving economic advantage through LIFE on the sly. That is wrong. The purpose of LIFE is and continues to be the conservation of the environment and the natural world. If the economy and the environment are fighting for priority, nature and the environment have to come out on top. I would therefore urge the House to vote against the ‘economic" amendments such as Amendments Nos 1, 4, 8, 15 and 25.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schleicher </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environment programme ‘LIFE" is the European Union"s most important instrument for the financing of environmental projects. It is thanks only to the action of the European Parliament that we now have access to considerable funding from the European budget, at any rate ECU 613 million for the next five years. Important though the goals are that were proposed by the European Commission for LIFE‐Environment, I feel that it is urgently necessary, in view of the problems that exist and the priorities repeatedly called for by the European Parliament, to mention the objectives of air and water pollution too. If these were not included the result would be that projects based on these objectives would receive practically no funding over the next five years. In the light of the discussion in the House on climatic disasters and water pollution, this must not be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a link here with a request which our group made as early as five years ago, that only those projects that are really new in terms of the current state of technological progress should be assisted, the problem being that currently, in certain regions of the Community, projects can be funded that are at a level of technological development already commonplace in other regions. This should not become common practice in future in view of the scarce resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">My group considers all projects funded by LIFE to be extremely important, of course, but we also fully support the objectives proposed by the Commission, such as the ‘starter" and ‘co‐op" measures. However, I also considered it important in this context to promote measures for the targeted conversion and development of areas and their land use, which are necessary to protect species and biotopes. These are the subject of another four amendments tabled by our group, and I would be grateful if they could be supported.</p>

Shortly, in the year 2000, we shall have a LIFE‐III. That will give Europe the chance to present itself with a new face as regards the environment and nature, but it will come at a price. Mrs Lienemann quoted a sum of EUR 850 million over five years. We are happy with that, but as a minimum. We shall certainly not be prepared to agree to anything less, because the current figure of EUR 450 m is decidedly inadequate. If you think about enlargement, we shall need a very great deal more money for LIFE‐III if the new Member States are to take part as well. Just compare that sum with all the billions we spend on agriculture and structural policy. It makes this financial instrument for the environment look very meagre indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it a great pity that my own country, the Netherlands, is quite progressive on environmental matters generally, but wants to cut the amount of money spent on LIFE‐III. Certainly if we consider that Natura 2000 already needs three to five billion euros a year, this sum of EUR 50 or 60 million a year which is currently available would appear to be well below the sum required.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe truly wishes to look kindly on nature and the environment, it must be prepared to pay for it. I therefore appeal not only to the Dutch Government but also to the Council. Sadly the Council representative is not here with us. I nevertheless call on the Council to agree to an increase in the budget for LIFE‐III.</p>

As stated in one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, it should contribute to sustainable development and to the inclusion of environmental policies in other Union policies. It should also facilitate the updating and implementation of environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, LIFE needs special funding. The Committee on Budgets welcomes the fact that no specific proposal has been put forward concerning the LIFE programme. Although it recognises that the programmes are effective, it is pleased that no specific proposal has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled and supported a number of amendments aimed at a specific financial proposal, bearing the Environment Agency"s second report very much in mind. As the rapporteur has rightly pointed out, this report warns us of the recent reduction in biodiversity within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree wholeheartedly with the Committee on the Environment"s view that priority should be given to cross‐border projects, to innovative projects and to projects generating employment. We believe that the LIFE instrument can contribute to job creation in the field of the environment. Reports on the LIFE I, LIFE II and LIFE III projects should be presented in 2002 as this will give the necessary impetus to a future LIFE IV.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the rapporteur does suggest changes, the distribution of funds across the three thematic components, LIFE‐Nature, LIFE‐Environment and LIFE‐Third Countries is of secondary importance. What is crucial is to have an appropriate sum available to enable a start to be made.</p>

The most important prerequisite for success is sufficient funding. But we have just seen from the case of Altener II that environmental programmes are the first to come under threat where cuts are made in funding. Almost every type of environmental initiative also creates jobs. The involvement of the applicant countries in the LIFE programme is of enormous importance. But we must not forget that these countries do not always have the necessary determination to improve the overall environmental situation. The European Union should therefore signal to these countries that their own efforts in the whole area of environmental protection are an essential condition for closer relations and, finally, accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In these countries there is the danger that environmental dumping is practised both in industry and in energy production. The improvement in the dissemination of information on LIFE projects and the associated increase in budget appropriations from 3 % to 5 % are also to be welcomed.</p>

It was launched by the Commission in 1992 and will reach the end of its second implementation phase on 31 December of this year. The regulation under discussion will cover the administration of the third phase of the programme for the next five‐year period 2000‐2004, and funding of EUR 613 million has been made available. LIFE consists of three thematic components, as the rapporteur has reminded us: LIFE‐Nature on the conservation of natural habitats, flora and fauna, helping to activate the Nature 2000 Network; LIFE‐Environment for the incorporation of environmental considerations into other policies and to implement and update environmental policy locally; and LIFE‐Third Countries for technical assistance to the Mediterranean and Baltic countries, to create the necessary administrative structures and draw up environmental policies and action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal for a Council regulation is important because it focuses on priorities such as: firstly, helping local authorities to integrate environmental considerations into land‐use planning; secondly, promoting sustainable development and incorporating environmental aspects into industrial activities; and thirdly, distributing financial resources for the protection of nature, for other actions and for actions in regions bordering on the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as third countries are concerned, it is particularly important to pay greater attention to the means and funds at their disposal, given that – as we all know – programmes drawn up by us, here in Europe, cannot be put into practice unless other countries' governments are able to cofinance them.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless believe that the third phase of the LIFE programme should be extended from five to seven years, with a proportionate increase in funding.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for the attention they have given to the proposal concerning a third phase of the financial instrument for the environment, LIFE. The report and the comments which have been presented here this evening are in line with the Commission's primary objectives, and many of the amendments emphasise the most important features of LIFE. I should also like to express my thanks for the comments made on the administration of the scheme in DG XI, and I am grateful to Mr van Dam for what he said concerning the evaluation which lies behind the proposal we are discussing here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1992 and 1998, LIFE had considerable success in NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries. 8 500 proposals were received, of which almost a third met the requirements. Around 1 300 projects have been cofinanced, with a total EC contribution of EUR 643 million. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that in budgetary terms, LIFE has proved to be an extremely effective tool. All the available resources have been used on valuable projects. As mentioned in the Commission's report pursuant to Article 7(3), LIFE could use more resources, up to and even above the reference amount which is indicated for LIFE II. It is therefore important for us to do everything possible to ensure adequate funding for the LIFE scheme. It is also important that LIFE is not penalised if financial restrictions should become necessary in future, as many of the speakers have mentioned here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course tempting to go into various details of the proposal, but I shall refrain from doing so and instead content myself with saying that I am pleased that the views of the Committee on the Environment and the proposed amendments are largely in line with the objectives. The Commission can therefore also accept 31 of the 47 amendments either in principle, in part or in full. I am interested to see that the Committee on the Environment is in favour of increasing the LIFE budget even beyond the amount the Commission has included in the financial statement for the proposed regulation. But as you know, the Commission does not accept the inclusion of reference budgets in the actual texts of regulations relating to financial programmes. Amendments Nos 33, 46 and 47 are therefore unacceptable. And the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 12 on a supplementary budget for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. As such, this question concerns all the Community instruments which are available to applicant countries, and can only be dealt with in the context of Association Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the committee procedure is concerned, for the time being the Commission is keeping to the 1987 decision. Changes can be made at a later stage, when a final decision has been reached about the new comitology proposal, and we are therefore rejecting Amendment No 37. Some of the amendments are aimed at extending the scope of LIFE‐Nature and LIFE‐Environment. This would run counter to the wish to concentrate the proposals on those areas where LIFE has the greatest added value. For this reason, we are rejecting Amendments Nos 39, 40 and 41. Amendment No 42 would entail a radical change in the purpose of preparatory projects, which is to develop new measures in the area of the environment, so we do not accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are a number of amendments requiring various reports to be submitted to Parliament. The Commission is prepared to give Parliament all the information necessary for the effective supervision of the programme, but this should not entail a large increase in the number of reports which have to be submitted to Parliament. That would in fact entail a further burden on the limited human resources. So we do not agree with Amendments Nos 31, 19 and 32. I would like to stress that the human resources for the administration of the LIFE scheme are limited. The administration of projects in third countries could become difficult in the coming years unless more resources are made available, and we would of course see it as an advantage if more resources were to be provided. We expect increasing participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in LIFE‐Nature and LIFE‐Environment. If we were to take on additional administrative tasks, it would mean that we would have to limit the resources that are needed for proper administration of the scheme, and the Commission cannot accept that, particularly not at this time when we have had so many discussions with Parliament about precisely this problem. For technical reasons, we therefore do not accept Amendments Nos 13, 14, 36 and 45.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that I am pleased with Mrs Lienemann's report. Most of the amendments help to strengthen the LIFE strategy. I am convinced that the Community has benefited from the LIFE projects already carried out, and with the new regulation this potential will be able to be realised in full in the years from 2000 to 2004.</p>
