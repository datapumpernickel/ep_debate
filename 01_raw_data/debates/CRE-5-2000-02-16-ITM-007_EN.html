I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:</p>
<p class="contents">- LIFE’s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;</p>
<p class="contents">- Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;</p>
<p class="contents">- The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;</p>
<p class="contents">- The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.</p>
<p class="contents"> I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents"> The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann’s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.</p>
<p class="contents">What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence. It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties. In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction. When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises. Moreover, the concept of ‘author’ is not defined in the Treaties. In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others. One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?</p>
<p class="contents">And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.</p>

The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been. This is why we are abstaining.

It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session. I am convinced that the rapporteur’s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament. This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament. These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report. We want EQUAL to go ahead.

The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.</p>
<p class="contents">EQUAL stands for “equality”. It must be seen to deliver. I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market. I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment. There must be flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative. In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives. The figure is now 5.35%. This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business. This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities. The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process. I also stressed the need for prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted. There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority. There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines. This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.

<p class="contents">However, this report, although probably inspired by the best intentions, occasionally takes a direction which I feel is highly dangerous in that it tends to erase notions of citizenship and legality and turns a multiplicity of exceptions into the common law on which the Community approach is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if one cannot but applaud the decision to adopt specific measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination on the labour market, which might affect asylum seekers whom life has already, by definition, treated badly, we still need to keep a legal conception of this notion: to put it plainly, where there is every reason to help asylum seekers who follow the correct procedure and are duly recognised as such, the same does not apply to the numerous categories listed in the report, namely applicants, those under temporary protection and those denied refugee status and threatened with repatriation, for whom the report makes provision for identical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that the so-called aid measures provided for in the report will spread insidiously and with disastrous results: asylum seekers, of course, plus asylum seekers under temporary protection while their applications are being processed and asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected and who are threatened with expulsion should all, according to the report, be able to benefit from this set of measures, whereas their very status – after all, what is an asylum seeker who has been refused refugee status and who is threatened with expulsion if not an illegal immigrant – should, at least for the last category, exclude them from a policy to integrate them into a Community which does not acknowledge their presence in its midst as legal or legitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we like it or not, a signal of this sort would be a fearful invitation to immigrants who, merely by applying for refugee status, irrespective of whether or not it is granted, would be able to qualify for a range of aid measures designed to help them integrate permanently into the labour market, in a general climate of shortage, in which the legal population, both foreign and indigenous, is cruelly aware of the problem of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, despite its general approach, which cannot but be endorsed, I am unable to support a report which contains in it the seed of a new attack on the concepts of citizenship and republican legitimacy which I hold so dear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater. It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances. Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy. The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998. A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions. However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council’s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years. The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years. All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16. I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources. I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: “Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved. But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">The “physico-chemical and ecological quality of water” was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally. It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.</p>

It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text. The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified. However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater. Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species. From this point of view, the common position is weak.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council’s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.</p>
<p class="contents">The “zero input” and “zero pollution” requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic. I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt “extremist” amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers. On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy. It damages Parliament. Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility. Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable. Is that the message we want to send out?</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers. This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds). I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment. It is clear that this model’s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences. However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market. Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality. In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market. This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.</p>
<p class="contents">By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon. In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas. As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions – although one with prospects – namely, the Region of Murcia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does, of course, contain a number of good observations. For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that “the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States’ social security systems”. Now, the concept of “uniform harmonisation” is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as “it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security. No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation”. The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain. Paragraph D points out that “the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria”, and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils. Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that “the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination”. And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter. This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU’s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark. It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The starting point for the Commission’s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States’ being able to maintain their social security arrangements. The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources. We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back. No-one would benefit from this situation. </p>
<p class="contents">Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements. Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels. </p>

Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational. The same applies to labour market policy. We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.

That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere. </p>

We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries. Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation. Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted. The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them. Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes. But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided. It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union. Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States. Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse. It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One also wonders whether this ‘coordinated modernisation strategy’ is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with many of the rapporteur’s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission’s and the Council’s intentions and plans concerning social protection. The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy’s objectives and aspirations. Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.</p>
<p class="contents">When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a ‘cost’ and an ‘obstacle’ to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people – always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs – it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will ‘enjoy’ even more degraded social provisions. The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems. So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the ‘working poor’ of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented? </p>
<p class="contents">Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people. Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the ‘modernisation’ of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
