<p class="contents">The attacks of 11 September have only strengthened our conviction that multilateral instruments for disarmament and non-proliferation are more crucial than ever. Everything possible must be done to prevent terrorist organisations and their members having access to more powerful means with which to carry out their criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against biological weapons must, in this context, be pursued at a more sustained pace, particularly given the threat of potential bioterrorist attacks. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a crucial instrument in this process. The European Union and its Member States have committed themselves to ensuring that this convention is universally observed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will be launching, with regard to the Fifth Review Conference on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that will take place in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001, a new call to those States that have not yet signed up to the Convention banning biological and toxin weapons, to ratify this as soon as possible. Strengthening this Convention is, furthermore, one of the Union’s priorities in the field of disarmament. The Council, therefore, attaches the greatest importance to concluding the negotiations that have taken place in Geneva, within the ad hoc group, on a legally binding protocol establishing an effective system that will ensure compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions of 11 June 2001, the Council of the European Union once again confirmed its commitment to contribute to the drawing up of a protocol containing a raft of practical measures that it had defined in its common position of 17 May 1999, as essential to the implementation of an effective instrument. In this regard, the Union regrets the fact that the special group has not managed to fulfil its mandate, which is to conclude these negotiations on a legally binding protocol before the opening of the Fifth Review Conference. The Union has, in fact, expressed its disappointment at the United States’ refusal to accept the synthesis text presented by the chairman of the special group. The Council is, therefore, maintaining its position. The threat biological weapons pose requires an appropriate multilateral response. The Council will continue to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work that must lead to a legally binding instrument and, in particular, to maintaining the special group.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has noted the statement by the United States, according to which that country supports all multilateral mechanisms currently in force for the control, non-proliferation and monitoring of arms exports and has also noted their alternative proposals, which the Union is still studying. We have already discussed them with the United States and will continue to do so in the context of preparations for the Review Conference. The Union reserves the right to also formulate its own proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Union hopes that the gains made in the negotiations are preserved and that the Review Conference is able to take decisions that offer prospects for a rapid renewal of negotiations within the multilateral framework of the Convention, with the participation of all States involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply wish to confirm that the European Union has, for its part, always been strongly in favour of the compromise text, convinced that it is as important as the agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons, provided that these are accompanied by effective verification measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is convinced that sending a negative signal on progress with international commitments on the non-proliferation of weapons would generally be damaging to world security.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, the compromise has not been accepted. It is, therefore, unlikely that a resolution will be produced before 19 November, but regular contacts are being maintained between the United States and the European Union on this matter. The United States take the view, furthermore, that the events of 11 September and those that have followed do not change their position on the verification protocol drawn up by the ad-hoc group.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, for its part, the European Union maintains that this compromise text would have enabled a major breakthrough to be made at a particularly critical moment. The Union also takes the view that the dynamic of discussions in the ad-hoc group must be preserved, even if the form and the procedure have to be adapted to circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is in the process of drafting new proposals for protection measures against the risk of a biological attack, insisting on the need to defend itself against the risk of terrorism. The European Union considers that some of the United States’ proposals are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, it also wishes to add others that are intended to improve the Convention and to encourage the development in the longer term of an instrument that is truly binding under law, but that is the very nub of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will also be proposing a mechanism that will enable us to pursue regular dialogue on the Convention and will open this up to all parties concerned. These measures will certainly be part of the discussions at the Fifth Review Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, and as has already been said, one thing is certain and that is that there will be no protocol verifying the biological weapons convention in the short term. We are seeking to uphold the achievements of the ad-hoc working group. Consultation is taking place on a regular basis with the United States and we are trying, on the basis of their proposals, to complement them with our own, so as to preserve the spirit of open and regular dialogue with all parties to the Convention. This, in our view, is the key to multilateralism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The appalling disaster of the World Trade Center and the launch by a few madmen of a campaign of anthrax poisoning can at least be credited with waking up public opinion and, through public opinion, waking political leaders, making them more aware of the dangers of the development of an international form of terrorism that is bent on imposing its view of the world by all means possible. In this regard, one only has to think of the recent sabre rattling by Osama Bin Laden. I hope, by the way, that this will be his last, because he will surely soon have to account to international justice for his crimes. I hope, however, that following his imminent fall, the international community will pursue its action to control and ban biological and chemical weapons in order to eliminate the terrible threat that they pose.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reasoning behind Parliament’s drafting of the motion for a resolution that will be submitted tomorrow for the approval of our fellow Members. We are pleased to see the change in the attitude of the American government which, in July, withdrew from negotiations on concluding a protocol to implement the Convention, as you have just reminded us, Commissioner, and we hope that the new conference that is due to take place next week in Geneva, which you informed us about, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, will consequently take place under the best possible auspices.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as representative of the Council, for having assured us of the Council’s desire to coordinate the actions of the Member State governments in this area. To this end, we call on the Commission to set up, under its own control, a specialist agency, that could rapidly intervene whenever breaches of the Convention are suspected. Could you, Commissioner, give us your personal opinion on this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, earlier this year we expressed our disappointment at the lack of support from the United States for the reinforcement of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. In the wake of the events of 11 September and the anthrax attacks on the United States, the issue of bio-terror has suddenly become very topical. Biological weapons are threatening to become part of the asymmetrical warfare which typifies the fight against terrorism. The Convention is, of course, directed at states, but the effective implementation also makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain these weapons. These weapons have been banned for a very long time, but are unfortunately still available. That is why we call for binding international rules in order to monitor compliance with the Convention better.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the Americans are back at the negotiating table. They have a problem which they are unable to solve on their own. However, the proposals they have tabled contain too many loopholes. The tighter and more transparent the controls, the better, and that must also be the EU’s focus of attention at the forthcoming review conference later this month. The Convention must become an instrument in the search of manufacturers of biological weapons, but also for tracking down existing supplies. Russia used to implement extensive programmes. How were they wound up, and what happened with the expertise gathered? It is rumoured that scientists who worked on these programmes have offered their services elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The anthrax attacks in the US compel us yet again to consider how we can stop the arms programmes in Iraq. For this purpose, the UN must launch new initiatives. Naturally, the Convention does not offer adequate protection against bio-terror, against the so-called non-governmental players. This also requires more and better cooperation with the police and intelligence services, as well as better criminal investigation methods. We need to offer our citizens better protection against possible attacks and the effects thereof. Many countries take measures in order to protect themselves against anthrax or smallpox better. The costs involved in those initiatives are enormous. Poor countries do not have those funds and could for that reason become the principal victim of a possible smallpox epidemic as a result of bio-terror. I would call on the EU and the EU Member States not only to consider the possible protection of its own citizens, but also to examine whether developing countries can be helped by setting up programmes to protect the people in the event of possible terrorist attacks involving biological weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all – and this point will appear in the compromise resolution which is not yet in print but it is certainly in our own resolution – my colleague, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, points out that the United Nations is extremely slow, or has been in the past, to respond when there are reports of breaches of use of these weapons. For example, when Saddam Hussein, in the early 90s, used these weapons in the marshes of Iraq, it took the United Nations three and a half weeks to get inspectors there, giving Saddam Hussein plenty of time to cover up the evidence of his crimes. Would the Council kindly point out to the United Nations that we need a much quicker response than three and a half weeks if such incidents happen in future, as we fear may happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this appears in the Liberal Group's resolution and also in the compromise resolution – the anthrax problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening. There is no European Union-wide agency looking at this although, in the USA, there is the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta. Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency, under its control, which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases? That would speed up our reaction and help us on a Union basis.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is addressed to the Council. I hope it is a hypothetical question. If the investigations in the USA show that the anthrax outbreak came from Iraq and therefore American public opinion becomes overwhelmingly in favour of an attack on Iraq and – I imagine that George Bush would find it very hard to resist such overwhelming public opinion – what would be the Council's position? Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well, or would we try to hold George Bush back? Has the Council considered this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the attack of 11 September on Manhattan, the American people remained in the grip of fear following the anthrax attacks which, although they resulted only in a limited number of victims, have a massive psychological effect which reaches far beyond the United States. The deadly product that was used points, in terms of its concentration and purity, in the direction of laboratories in the United States itself which are reported to be the only ones in the world that could make the product. This clearly shows that the risks which our population faces as a result of the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons are insufficiently removed by current legislation. A conference on this subject matter is to take place in Geneva shortly, and we would remind you that in July, notably, the United States withdrew from the negotiations about the Protocol that is before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 14 June to back the approval of this Protocol. However, we are convinced that an outright ban should apply to both the manufacture and the use of chemical and biological weapons by the international community, and that this ban should be legally binding. Current supplies should be destroyed expertly, and I fear that the Protocol too could still be too weak to cope with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be applied and its application cannot be monitored without a protocol setting out how this is to be done, something we have been trying to achieve for years. We have not succeeded. The United States sabotaged the protocol, do not ask me why. I read papers by American analysts who say that they have not had time to complete various biological warfare programmes which are up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, following the awful events in New York and the anthrax attacks in the United States, we need to get back to the concept of monitoring and applying this treaty as quickly as possible, come what may. I was astounded to hear the Commissioner say that the position of the United States has not changed and that we are unlikely to have a protocol with provisions on monitoring and applying the treaty in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously need to withdraw what we say in the joint motion before you, honourable Members, about welcoming the change in the position of the United States. We have made a mistake. We must change it tomorrow in an oral amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not told us how you intend to exert greater pressure on the United States, given that the whole business is down to them. Will discussion alone suffice, I wonder?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, new factors have come into play, Mr President. It has been proven that genetic engineering can be used for this sort of weapon of mass destruction by applying research into vaccines and other forms of treatment which are easily hijacked for military purposes. I have tabled an amendment for tomorrow's vote. I think that we should adopt it and that the European Union should include this issue in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, as the FBI is saying, that the anthrax was made and supplied in the United States, are there any Members here who propose that someone, do not ask me who, should bomb the United States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The possible use of military technology and biological and chemical weapons by subversive groups is no longer a remote risk but a real civil defence problem. The loss of military secrets, experts and materials has now been verified and is the real basis that the strategy of terrorism can use to strike against the civil population, which is defenceless in the face of such new aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">To address this new scenario of warfare, in which the enemy is well concealed in the meshes of civil society, protected by the very rights of freedom he is fighting against and where the targets are no longer just the armed forces but the civil population, it is vital to know what threats may be hanging over the safety of the citizens. In view of the fact that some nations have not signed up to the Geneva Convention on chemical and biological weapons, as we have heard, and have continued to develop these technologies of warfare, we appeal to the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union, as well as all those states that have not taken part or signed up, to provide the international community with detailed information on the biological and chemical agents they know about which could, in some way, be traced or stolen by terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation, stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction, and, at the same time, to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, this does not prevent us from expressing our deep sympathy with the American people and especially the families affected. However, I believe that this sign of isolationism and unilateralism, which is still very strong in America, must be viewed by the European Union, and in particular by the Council, as an opportunity to lobby the US very hard, not only on this issue but also on the International Criminal Court, for effective international agreements and monitoring arrangements in the wake of these dreadful attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is grotesque that in recent days, Congress has debated a bill which vehemently opposes the establishment of the International Criminal Court – a Court which would deal with crimes like these, especially if they were supported and perpetrated by states.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point – and I would like to address the Commission in particular here – is how we, in Europe, are equipped, as far as is humanly possible, to defend ourselves against such attacks or to reduce their impact to a minimum. As has already been mentioned, the USA has an agency in Atlanta, a disease control centre. Does the Commission think this should be considered in Europe as well? Of course, I know that when there is a problem, there is a tendency to call for a new EU agency to be set up, which raises further problems of control and supervision. However, in light of recent developments, I think that there are various arguments in favour of this type of agency.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, I think that the Commission must do more regarding security against this type of terrorist attack, whether it involves biological or nuclear weapons. This is not a task which we can simply leave to the Member States. Certain safety standards in these areas must be set out at European level in response to this type of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Commission, together with the Council, must consider how we should deal with the installations, factories and laboratories which handle these hazardous products, especially genetically modified products, without encroaching unnecessarily on the privacy of employees while achieving a minimum of transparency, protection and prevention. Those who work in this kind of installation must therefore be prepared to accept a certain measure of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Commission once again what it intends to do to create this protection, not only in general terms but also as regards practical measures, in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent. Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves. If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s. In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem is the most crucial. It is wrong to point to the USA alone. This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well. If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role. We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted. Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues. I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the context of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, there was clearly never any question of discussing an Agency. The Union’s position was to propose a mechanism for pursuing dialogue beyond the Review Conference in the form of either annual meetings of the signatories as is done for the Convention on Chemical Weapons, or of meetings of experts, in other words, continuing the former ad hoc group as was explained in the current state of discussions on this Convention. Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that, at the Ghent Summit and, of course, at the request of the presidency of the European Union, the Commission has undertaken work on examining this issue in all its aspects and, therefore, on listing laboratories, in an attempt to see what type of response we can provide. At the Commission meeting yesterday, a joint briefing sheet was issued by Mr Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer protection, to Mr Liikanen and myself, to see how we can implement, at European Union level, in agreement, of course with the Member States, closer coordination in order to achieve our objectives, without necessarily creating an Agency. This is, broadly speaking, the way things are heading. In this regard, I would say that in the field of research itself, and, therefore, of the potential for knowledge in this area, we are planning a meeting dedicated to this issue, on 13 December, in Brussels, of all experts from the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
