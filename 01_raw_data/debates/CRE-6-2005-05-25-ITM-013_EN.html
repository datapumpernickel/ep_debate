It goes without saying that these relations have a particularly important place in the European Union’s external relations, a place that has become even more important since the enlargement of the EU. It is also true that this report was, to a large extent, drafted prior to the summit. We will therefore have to examine how the analysis and facts set out in this report will need to be supplemented in the light of the conclusions and discussions that took place at the 15th EU<span class="bold">–</span>Russia summit in Moscow on 10 May.</p>
<p class="contents">It was at that summit that the European Union and Russia reached agreement on the terms of a strategic partnership enabling us to improve cooperation in the four Common Spaces: the economic space and the spaces of freedom, security and justice, of external security and, finally, of research, education and culture. Of course, the negotiations on the four road maps specifically identifying cooperation in these four spaces encountered some difficulties, given that their aim was to reorganise all of our relations by adopting hundreds of operational points that now need to be implemented. We can, however, congratulate ourselves on the result achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">By agreeing, in Moscow, on an overall package including road maps for the four spaces, Russia and the European Union have succeeded in reaching a new stage in relations between them, namely the implementation of a true strategic partnership as decided upon in May 2003 at the Saint Petersburg summit. This is an undeniable success which has not been significantly tarnished by the Russians’ reference to certain difficulties connected with the transit of goods to Kaliningrad. In the opinion of President Putin, the agreement on the four spaces should make it possible, in his words, ‘to build a greater Europe’. I think that is an objective that we can share, provided that this greater Europe is based on values to which we ourselves subscribe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Economic Space, during the summit, Russia renewed its agreement, given in 2004, to the gradual abolition of payments for Siberian overflight rights, which are no longer justified. Negotiations on the exact procedure for this phasing out should be concluded shortly, and its entry into force should not be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia expressed its wish for greater cooperation in the energy sector, which moves in the direction of our own interests. It is presenting itself as a reliable partner for the European Union in this sector, as in others, and it has committed itself to implementing the Kyoto Protocol, even if it is threatening at the same time to withdraw if the system is not reformed by 2012. These discussions show that the subject of global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, and particularly what will follow the Kyoto Protocol, is vitally important and we must therefore pursue this line of dialogue with the Russians.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s membership of the WTO is also a prospect that must be developed rapidly, as it is once again a matter of fully integrating Russia into the multilateral system by making it subject, in this way, to international disciplines, particularly to disciplines in terms of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the space of freedom, security and justice, one of the most important points in this space is certainly the free movement of persons. Despite the lack of specific results on this point at the summit, the European Union still views it as extremely important to reach a speedy conclusion to negotiations with the Russians with a view to signing an agreement relaxing, on the basis of strict reciprocity, the conditions for issuing short<span class="bold">–</span>stay visas, and also a readmission agreement. This latter point is vital for the EU and there can be no relaxation in the visa requirements without a parallel readmission agreement. We know that the Russians are reporting difficulties in this respect, but they are no longer rejecting or ruling out the conclusion of such an agreement, which they are now linking to the conclusion of similar agreements with their own neighbours. This is therefore a matter that must be developed continuously and a subject on which dialogue with the Russians must be actively pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that, on 18 May, the Russians signed the agreement fixing the border with Estonia. We are, unfortunately, still waiting for an analogous agreement to be signed with Latvia and we must encourage the Russians to sign such an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the space of external security, we agreed with the Russians during the summit that closer cooperation should make it possible to work together to reach a peaceful conclusion to what are known as ‘frozen’ conflicts affecting our common neighbourhood or, rather, to use the wording that was finally used in the conclusions, ‘the regions adjacent to Russia and the European Union’. In this context, I am thinking, amongst other things, of the Transnistrian conflict in the Republic of Moldova. Adoption of the wording ‘adjacent regions’ enabled us to overcome the initial reservations that Russia expressed on this subject and I think that both the European Union and Russia have much to gain from our cooperation in this region of the world where any developments have direct repercussions for Russia and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also stipulated in the joint road map that all cooperation processes must be based on the sovereign decisions of States and the text clearly recognises <span class="bold">– </span>and I think that this is one of the most important points <span class="bold">– </span>that the European Union and Russia share the same common values. It is therefore those common values, including respect for sovereign rights, and also respect for human rights and for the principles of the rule of law, that must guide the development of our relations with Russia. Let me take this opportunity to say a word about our common interests concerning the fight against terrorism: the fight against terrorism must be based on these values and on respect for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The space of research, education and culture is an important space where the people of Russia and Europe can meet and forge closer links, because we have a common cultural and historical heritage. In this important space, we need to develop a number of initiatives. One in particular has already been decided: a European institute in Moscow is to be opened in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of all our relations with Russia. With this great country, which also holds the key to the stability of our continent, we need to build a long<span class="bold">–</span>term trusting relationship based, I would stress again, on democratic principles, on just those values that must characterise the construction of this greater Europe that we want just as much as they seem to. In so doing, we cannot ignore the fact that we must also engage in a tough but constructive dialogue on issues of human rights, on issues to do with the freedom of the press, and on other humanitarian issues arising in particular in regions such as Chechnya. This dialogue has been launched, particularly on human rights. It must be pursued actively as an integral part of our relations with Russia, because it is in the interests of the European Union to have a reliable partner in Russia, to have a partner that contributes to the stability of our continent and that also shares the fundamental values that we are trying to defend on this continent.</p>

<p class="contents">Since the EU was enlarged just over a year ago, our powerful neighbour in the east, Russia, has become more and more important to us. The country has been a strategic partner for a long time, and we share many challenges and tasks that require cooperation and common solutions. Trade, the environment, energy and the fight against terrorism and organised crime are just a few of the areas concerned. We need good relations in order to be able to achieve stability, security and prosperity throughout the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partnership has not, however, been without its problems, and it is pleasing that, at the summit on 10 May, we succeeded in agreeing upon cooperation within the Four Common Spaces. The relevant summary included approximately 400 practical – although not especially practical – points requiring cooperation, but these are still far from being resolved. It is important and gratifying that this much progress has been made, but it also remains to be seen what lies beyond the rhetoric. The President<span class="bold">–</span>in<span class="bold">–</span>Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, said that the EU and Russia had still not embarked upon their honeymoon but that there was true love between the two. It now remains to be seen what this means for their future marriage plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dependent upon each other, but relations have been strained and cooperation made more difficult by internal developments in Russia that have seen a decline in human rights and democracy under Putin. Ever more power has been concentrated in the Kremlin and in Putin personally. Political parties have been marginalised, and there have been restrictions upon freedom of expression and the free media. There is still extensive corruption, and there seems to be no end to the atrocities in the bloody conflict in Chechnya. The murder of Maskhadov, Chechnya’s elected president, will not make a political solution any easier. Putin and the EU also have different views of developments in the neighbouring countries. The situation in our common neighbourhood has in many ways been gratifying. In Ukraine and Georgia, people have turned away from authoritarian regimes and instead chosen democracy, openness and renewal. This is an area in which we must together realise that we have everything to gain from democratic neighbouring countries, and Russia and Putin must accept that these countries do not belong to the Russian sphere of interest. The people of those countries want democracy and see the EU, and not Russia, as a model for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems in terms of cooperation are not, however, only due to Russia. Relations have been made more difficult by the fact that the EU and the individual Member States send out different signals. The common policy places very strong emphasis upon values such as democracy and human rights but, when individual Heads of Government meet Putin, the common values tend to end up very far down on the agenda. Instead, there is a focus on, for example, energy. This does not give a helpful picture of the EU and creates confusion on the Russian side. In the report we are discussing, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is critical of some aspects of the way in which Russia’s domestic politics have developed and thinks that the EU must be clear. The conflict in Chechnya can only be resolved politically. The EU must offer to act as a mediator and, as time goes on, also participate in the work of construction. Terrible atrocities are taking place against civilians in Chechnya. This concerns us all. There is no internal conflict. No one denies the terrible acts committed in Russia – I am thinking, for example, of the massacre in Beslan – but these do not justify the atrocities in Chechnya and the unwillingness to put the soldiers responsible on trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of its size and geographical position and because it is our neighbour, Russia is an incredibly important partner. There is no alternative to active cooperation, but we need to focus on a number of practical areas of cooperation in which the EU and Russia both benefit from results. Quality, and not quantity, should be the determining factor behind this work, and the issues relating to democracy must never cease to be integrated. The EU must convince Russia that economic development and trade go hand in hand with modernisation, a functioning legal system and democratic reforms. We support Russia’s ambitions to join the WTO, together with the reforms that this will entail. We look forward both to greater cooperation in the environmental sphere in connection, for example, with maritime safety and with safety in relation to nuclear energy, and we look forward to a continuation of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. We hope that, together, we shall find a solution to the conflict in Transnistria and that the Russian troops will be withdrawn from Moldova and Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we must mainly look forwards, but we have a common, and at times dramatic and bloody, history. In order to move forwards, we need to be able to put the past behind us, but, in order to do that, a process of reconciliation is required. The archives in Europe and Russia from the Second World War must be opened up, and Russia must recognise its occupation of the Baltic states and the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union. It is excellent that the border agreement with Estonia has been signed. A similar agreement now remains to be signed with Latvia too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a limited ability to influence developments. That is why it is incredibly important never to retreat from those values on which EU cooperation is based and to make it clear to our large neighbour that we shall not do so. The EU and Russia will only ever be able to achieve a true partnership if it is based on the defence of democracy. The Russian people is not helped by our remaining silent on important issues of principle. A coherent strategy with a common message, instead of one<span class="bold">–</span>man shows by individual leaders, is the only way of conducting a credible policy towards Russia.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero–Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mrs Malmström for the very useful report. Its timing is highly opportune, coming just after the successful EU<span class="bold">-</span>Russia summit that President Barroso, Commissioner Mandelson and I attended in Moscow, together with the Council presidency. As we now begin implementing what has been agreed, it is very important to say that Russia is a strategic partner, but at the same time we also have to speak with one voice and we have to address all the questions – both the more difficult and the less difficult questions – which I can assure you we did.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the issues in your report are highly relevant to the discussions we had in Moscow. Let me give you a very short overview from my side. Of course, I can only complement what the presidency very eloquently said.</p>
<p class="contents">The major achievement was adopting the four roadmaps for the four ‘common spaces’ that we have been negotiating for many months. The last summit meeting in November was more difficult and we were far from coming to an agreement, whereas through the many individual negotiations that we conducted we finally achieved our result in the four areas: the economy; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research and culture. They will now provide a good basis for significantly enhancing and strengthening our relations with Russia in the coming years, which is necessary. We have the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, but this alone is no longer an adequate basis. We had to enhance it by these four common spaces.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, we confirmed that the EU<span class="bold">–</span>Russia relationship is based on common values – and I am glad that President Putin himself mentioned that – including respect for human rights and democracy, the rule of law, and a free market economy. These values must now also guide us as we turn to implementation. President Putin, in a speech he gave in the Duma, very clearly mentioned that, and we are encouraged by this as also by the human rights dialogue that we had with Russia, which was a very frank and open dialogue where all these questions were raised and discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic sphere, I very much welcome your emphasis on our common interest in seeing Russia become a real partner with an open, dynamic, intensified economy and also – this is equally important – a transparent judicial system. This will be at the forefront as Russia comes closer to WTO membership and, as you said, we all support that because we think this is the direction that has to be taken and which will start to create a real common economic space.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit we also made clear that phasing out non<span class="bold">–</span>commercial payments for Siberian over<span class="bold">–</span>flights is essential for our economic cooperation. We also ensured that energy cooperation and the Kyoto Protocol are very high on the list of priorities in our roadmap. I can confirm to you that, as requested in your resolution, the Commission will continue to provide financial support for Russia’s implementation of Kyoto and for nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of freedom, security and justice, we agreed that we must rapidly conclude negotiations on both, on the one hand on readmission and on the other hand on visa facilitation. I believe that the agreement on both issues is within reach and we should aim to conclude it as soon as possible. Our aim would be the next summit in October. I know this is a very ambitious aim but I say as soon as possible. The Commission and the Member States remain convinced – we said so clearly and it was part of our difficult negotiations until the very end – that the simultaneous implementation of the two agreements is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We also raised, as did President Barroso, the issue of human rights and the dialogue with Russia on the Northern Caucasus. Following the April fact<span class="bold">–</span>finding mission by DG Relex, we are now exploring ways and means of providing financial support, especially for socio<span class="bold">–</span>economic recovery, in addition to our considerable humanitarian assistance. We have to create a new climate there and we also want to do a lot on the question of technical support. We want to bring people out of the Northern Caucasus, out of Chechnya, so that they can also see a different environment. This is also very important for a future process designed to lead to reconciliation and to better social and economic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course all this should lead to free and fair elections. This should be the aim. We would also like to improve administrative and institutional structures. We have to continue our dialogue with the Russian authorities on this point. We also agreed that human rights and international obligations must be respected as part of fighting terrorism in an effective and very resolute way.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to external security, we agreed with the Russian authorities that we both want an integrated Europe without new dividing lines. Even if the four common spaces include the notion of adjacent regions, President Putin himself acknowledged that it is a common neighbourhood and we have to work within the common neighbourhood to make it a better, more stable neighbourhood for both of us. That means that we want to cooperate on the question of stability and prosperity in neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, without forcing them to choose one camp. They should proceed with their internal reforms and find solutions for their very difficult problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me underline the importance of our agreement on research, education and culture. Those areas, even if they do not seem to be highlighted, are specific areas for people<span class="bold">– </span>to<span class="bold">– </span>people contacts. We want to promote more exchanges with regard to university studies and also want to work on different cultural projects with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Your resolution rightly draws attention to the fact, as I said at the beginning, that Russia is an important strategic partner for us, and all the more so since enlargement. This has highlighted the need to further develop cooperation with Russia in the north<span class="bold">– </span>western regions, especially in the ‘Northern Dimension’. I must also agree with your suggestion that the Union’s policy on Russia has too often suffered from a lack of coherence. I said Member States must stick to the common line and we appealed very often to them to do so during our negotiations. Since in the end everybody stuck to this line, we managed to come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the success of our summit will enable us to strengthen relations on a now broadly agreed basis and in a coherent manner. We will be able substantially to deepen our cooperation across a wide range of sectors, and we must use all the possibilities offered by the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Parliament that the Commission will take full account of all the points made in its resolution and I remain as always at your disposal for further discussions.</p>

<p class="contents">Russia, though, is not a candidate country; this is not a progress report in which we sit in judgment, saying, ‘that is wrong and that is wrong and there you need to do more’. In this instance, we are applying a quite different procedure. While drawing attention to violations of human rights or developments in democracy that we regard as undesirable, we should refrain from itemising what is going on in Russia and passing didactic judgment on each individual item. It is important that this summit has brought concrete results, laying a foundation on which internal and external security may be established, economic cooperation guaranteed, and joint projects in research, education and culture facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">What struck me as very important in today’s debate was what Commissioner Ferrero<span class="bold">–</span>Waldner had to say: if the whole thing is to work, Europe must speak with one voice. In that case, it will not be acceptable for individual Member States – Germany, France or Spain – to hold separate summits with Russia and pursue a contrary policy, without, moreover, informing either our Baltic friends or the European institutions. One might be so bold as to say that Germany will refrain from such things after September of this year, but in the case of France and Spain we will, no doubt, have to live with it for some time yet.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of a final comment, let me say that cooperation in regional conflicts appears to me to be very important. Reference has been made to Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno<span class="bold">–</span>Karabakh, and the EU has offered to help in Chechnya as well. Rather than being limited to humanitarian operations, it must also have a political dimension, and Russia would be well advised to respond to this signal from Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Positive developments have recently taken place in EU<span class="bold">-</span>Russia relations. We warmly welcome the adoption of the single package of roadmaps for the creation of the four ‘common spaces’ at the last EU<span class="bold">–</span>Russia summit in Moscow. We consider this a breakthrough in the EU<span class="bold">–</span>Russia strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are both committed to multilateralism, which is the only solution to global problems. Therefore, we should work together in reforming the United Nations. We as European Socialists regard Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as a highly positive step. We acknowledge Russia’s constructive role in the fight against terrorism and in nuclear disarmament. We look forward to mutually beneficial energy cooperation with no added political motivation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support the accession of Russia to the WTO. However, we should not forget about divergences of opinion or disputes. We are deeply worried about the weakening of democracy in Russia. We also call on Russia to ensure better protection of national minorities. Without a readiness to reach a compromise and start a reconciliation process there can be no chance of ending the suffering and developing a lasting peace in the framework of a wide autonomy for the Republic of Chechnya. The European Union and Russia can only develop a real strategic partnership if Russia fully endorses the basic European values and principles of democracy, the rule of law and full protection of human and minority rights. It is in our common and vital interest to maintain Russia’s democratisation, modernisation and European orientation. There is no alternative to a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation that is reliable, sustainable and mutually advantageous.</p>

The same also applies to the problem of secure energy supplies, to which Russia can provide a partial solution. At the same time, however, there can be no one who is not concerned at the way in which the major energy companies operate in Russia. I need only remind the House that the head of Gazprom leads Putin’s cabinet, that his deputy chief of staff, Mr Sechin, runs Rosneft, and that Mr Ivanov, Mr Surkov and Mr Prikhodko are in charge of Transneft, Aeroflot and so on. This all begs the question of whether these companies are in fact operating according to market mechanisms, or whether they are instead instruments of Russian foreign policy. A great many recent developments, such as the problems experienced with the supply of crude oil to Ukraine, suggest that the latter is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">A further question that needs to be addressed relates to the future direction of Russian policy. No one could fail to be alarmed at the bill presented by Mr Dmitri Rogozin to the Duma, which, if it is adopted, will make it possible for Russia to incorporate whole new regions into the Russian Federation without anyone’s permission. Those justifying such a move have made it quite clear which regions are involved, and these include Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">This leaves us with the problem of whether we should not occasionally alert Russia to our concerns, which are entirely justified. Of course, it will be Russia that decides on the future shape of our relations with Russia and on the future face of Russia itself, but I do not believe that there should be any let<span class="bold">–</span>up in our efforts to highlight certain concerns.</p>

We want close cooperation with it in the widest variety of spheres. Notwithstanding the many strategic reasons for this partnership, however, it must be based on respect for the European understanding of values. It may well be the case that parts of the EU are dependent on Russian energy and raw materials, but this must not mean that we betray our democratic and human rights principles.</p>
<p class="contents">We must set an example and involve Russia in matters relating to the rights of minorities, in particular with regard to the protection of Russian minorities in the Baltic. A comprehensive peace process must be set in motion in Chechnya, with the help of all democratic forces in society. Military action is more than merely a dead end; it is a disaster, and not only that, but a crime. The Stalin and Brezhnev eras may be things of the past, but the post<span class="bold">–</span>Communist tsarist approach of the Kremlin, with its restrictions on freedom of the press and information, renders a peace process in Chechnya impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only hope is the development of civil society. What we want is a political solution, and one that is reached with the assistance of the EU. I was present when the handing down of sentences to Mr Khordokovsky and Mr Lebedev began in Moscow, and this sentencing, which is still in progress, is shocking evidence of the contempt with which the EU’s fundamental values – the rule of law, democracy and human rights – are being treated. What other explanation can there be for these two people attending the preliminary hearing under heavy guard and in an iron cage, as though they were dangerous predators?</p>
<p class="contents">Large parts of the indictments were reproduced word for word in the grounds for the ruling, right down to the mistakes. The break<span class="bold">–</span>up of Yukos is an economic death sentence, and Khordokovsky is not being given a fair chance in this political show trial. Is this Russia worthy of being a strategic partner of the EU? Proceedings in accordance with the rule of law are inseparable from human rights under any regime, and that is also the case in empires.</p>

Russia has been a source of fascination for all of Europe throughout modern history, or in other words since the Middle Ages. On the one hand, we saw it as the successor to Byzantium and a bulwark for Europe against invaders from the East. On the other hand, we regarded it as an Asian country, and thought of it primarily in barbarian terms. On the one hand we saw its lofty traditions, the golden cupolas of its churches and its culture, whilst on the other we saw the staggering riches of its rulers and the extreme poverty of millions of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposing views of this kind are still to be found in today’s motion for a resolution. On the one hand, Russia is described as a major supplier of raw materials that are vital to the European Union, as well as an enormous market and a potential ally of European culture and traditions. On the other hand, misgivings are voiced regarding the great expanse of Eastern Europe and Russia’s powerful armed forces, which are equipped with modern weapons and which have already been involved in a number of peacekeeping missions with EU troops, for example in the Balkans. The authors of the resolution should have reserved attacks of the kind to be found in the part of the resolution demanding common standards of behaviour for the armed forces of another of our partners, if we are to believe the reports from Iraq. I am assuming, of course, that the necessary steps have not yet been taken in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The contradictions I mentioned previously can also be seen clearly in a number of amendments. I would call on the Members of this House to remember who it was that protected Europe from the Nazi terror 60 years ago, and, even as they criticise totalitarianism, to avoid succumbing to Russophobia. When voting on this resolution, we should ensure that a spirit of constructive cooperation prevails over mistrust and condescending advice. After all, we cannot ignore the fact that millions of Russians died in order to liberate Europe. We should never fail to make a clear distinction between the loyal ally which played a large part in liberating most of Europe, and which fulfilled its commitments towards its other allies in Asia 60 years ago, and the country that attacked us. This distinction should also be reflected in the relevant parts of our resolutions and debates.</p>
<p class="contents">When fervent advocates of democracy talk in this Chamber about the problems experienced by national minorities in Russia, even though they themselves come from countries where hundreds of thousands of citizens have not been granted citizenship, I find it hard to know whether they are making fun of all of us, or whether they are merely demonstrating barefaced cheek and a shaky grasp of what democracy means.</p>
<p class="contents">We need Russia as the European Union’s closest ally, and we need it as a friend, in order to resolve the ever<span class="bold">–</span>increasing problems with which the world today confronts us. Friends should be asked, not ordered to do things, and Members of this House should remember this when voting on the resolution tomorrow, whilst ensuring that their own personal views take a back seat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The countries of Europe have had differing historical experiences of relations with Russia. For Latvia and the other Baltic States the experience was particularly tragic. The USSR occupied the Baltic States twice. Over 60 000 innocent people were sent from Latvia to Siberia in cattle trucks, without any legal process, and only a few returned. To a great extent the deportations were carried out so that the possessions and homes of those expelled could be handed over, lock, stock and barrel, to the new settlers.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia must acknowledge the occupation of the Baltic States. This would also make it possible to legally distinguish national minorities from immigrants, whose rights in Europe are regulated by entirely different laws or norms, as my fellow Members have stated here; this is a subject on which Latvia has to listen to unfounded accusations by Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty in the European Parliament resolution is to send a clear signal to Russia, stating that the retreat from democracy which we have observed recently is unacceptable. In order for us to be successful, it is important for the countries of the European Union to speak with one voice to Russia, and also to pull no punches in calling things by their real names. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say straight away that the European Union quite obviously always gives priority to countries that are members of the European Union, and that these countries are granted particular protection and support for historical, political and economic reasons. In this instance, this applies primarily to Poland and the Baltic states.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot ignore the fact that Russia is undergoing a major transformation, and that throwing off the Soviet system is a key aspect of this process. The success of the latter in many areas means that supporters of the old Soviet system now appear to have no real chance any more of being elected in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must realise that a process of this kind can only work in the long run if it is based on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and we must acknowledge that there are grounds for criticism in this respect. This brings me on to my fourth point, however, which is that we must keep lines of dialogue with Russia open. It is for this reason that we are building a strategic partnership, which has been embodied in the four common areas, for example, and the common energy policy, which will be formulated in such a way as to prevent one<span class="bold">–</span>sided dependence on our part. The events that will take place in 2007, and our joint preparations for these events, will also be a focus for this strategic partnership, as 2007 will see the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreements, the holding of elections in Russia and the planned entry of Russia into the WTO. Enlargement will perhaps have been completed by this time, and we may even have a constitution. It follows that we must make sensible preparations for 2007, when all these events may take place.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and even though we must continue to voice our criticisms, it would therefore be useful to emphasise the importance of keeping channels of dialogue open. This would allow us to help ensure that developments in Russia move in a sensible direction, which is in both our interests and our neighbours’ interests, and would help prevent fresh outbreaks of hostility. Most importantly, dialogue with Russia is necessary because we need the country’s help on such matters as the Middle East, the UN and the Security Council. Even though criticism is necessary, therefore, we should also maintain a spirit of friendly cooperation, and we should continue to pursue the goal of achieving such a balance.</p>

Does this agreement mean that all questions surrounding EU<span class="bold">–</span>Russia relations have been answered? The answer is still in the negative.</p>
<p class="contents">While the roadmaps that have been laid down indicate to both partners where they can begin to improve their cooperation in a number of areas, other questions remain unresolved, and I should like to single out three of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia and the European Union have a large number of common interests in the areas of the economy, energy, security and the fight against crime. At the same time, it can be said that there are worrying developments within Russia as regards the values for which the European Union stands, not least democracy, the rule of law and transparency. Commissioner Wallström was right, in her report, to devote a great deal of attention to this. In its approach towards Russia, the European Union must try to strike a balance between those values and interests, one that will, at the same time, enable us to have a positive bearing on Russia’s internal developments. The establishing of a transparent democracy and economy in Russia is not only a theoretical concept in the longer term; it is also a matter of common concern to the peoples of Europe and Russia. In order to be effective on this score, the Member States must manage to keep their ranks closed in the direction of Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is the resolution of the deadlocked conflicts in Moldova and Georgia. The EU must do everything in its power to persuade Russia to adopt a more cooperative stance, and we must capitalise on the room in the agreements recently concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Russia is a crucial factor in the success of the Neighbourhood Policy in the new neighbouring countries, but policy<span class="bold">–</span>making and implementation are far too inadequate for the time being. The EU’s Russia policy must take greater account of the neighbourhood policy objectives, which should not become secondary to relations between Europe’s capitals and Moscow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, in their talks with Putin, most Heads of Government avoid sensitive issues such as the war in Chechnya and observance of human rights. If they do say anything at all, their views sometimes conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European journalist Ben van der Velden’s book. ‘European powerlessness’, I read a transcript of an interview between the author and Commissioner Patten. On 27 October 2003, Commissioner Patten had the following to say about his contacts with the Russian Government, and I quote: ‘My unusual opinion is that you do not achieve anything with friendly meetings. You have to look at what you get from the other party. At summits, you must also be prepared to make a nuisance of yourself about an issue such as Chechnya.’</p>
<p class="contents">This House has always stood for an inclusive peace process, in other words a process that encompasses all layers of Chechen society, inside of Chechnya but also the rebels who renounce terrorism. It is true that at summits, the non<span class="bold">–</span>observance of human rights and the fight against international terrorism should be on the agenda, but so should a political solution, which we should try to enforce.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect, Commissioner, it is a bad thing to talk about support for socio<span class="bold">–</span>economic recovery on top of the desperately needed humanitarian aid, without there being a serious solution to the conflict. I have visited Chechnya and Grozny, and I saw what happened with the funds. Either they are used to erect government buildings or they will soon end up in the hands and pockets of criminals such as Ramzan Kadurov.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a reality, and perhaps we should acknowledge that a flexible approach does not work in Russia. Maybe we should acknowledge and do what Khrushchev did at one time in a meeting for the United Nations: he took off his shoe, pounded the table and said ‘This is my will’. Why does Europe not do this in relation to the war in Chechnya? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the point of view of the Americans, we will look on her as an adversary; from the point of view of the former Warsaw Pact, we will look on her with fear. The point is: do we look on her as a country with which we can cooperate?</p>
<p class="contents">We are laying down conditions here. Let me read in particular condition 24, in which the EU 'asks Russia to reaffirm its commitments to the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldova and to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova in accordance with the request of these sovereign states'. And rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did you not impose the same condition on Turkey and ask it to withdraw its military forces from an occupied country which is a Member State of the European Union? Why the double standards? Why are we asking Russia to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova – and rightly so – but not asking the same of Turkey?</p>
<p class="contents">You are asking Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the environment. And rightly so. Why did we not ask the same of the Americans, who pollute the environment 16 times more – according to official statistics – than Russia?</p>

It should come as no surprise that our thoughts on the matter are favourable. At the same time, however, President Putin’s policies present us with a problem. This is a man who violates human rights, who places restrictions on economic and political freedoms, who has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of history and who has awarded a medal to General Jaruzelski. The latter was joint commander of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and in charge of the defeat of Solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Divide and conquer’ has been one of the guiding principles of the Kremlin’s policies for some time now. Russia maintains close, and even friendly, ties with certain EU countries, whilst snubbing others. One could say that this is a political strategy that has been employed since time immemorial, but I would ask why the other side should have to sit back and allow it to happen. At the same time, of course, we should be asking ourselves who this other side actually is. Is it just a few Western countries whose governments believe that friendship with Russia is worth the extra expense, no matter what history has to say, are we referring to the countries of Eastern Europe that are subject to increasing pressure from Russia, or do we in fact mean the EU as a whole?</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said about the EU’s common foreign policy recently, in particular with regard to the Constitutional Treaty. The issue we are now debating will put this policy to the test. Now the EU must send out a clear sign of solidarity to Russia, and a sign that we will gauge its good will towards the EU as a whole on the basis of its approach to the new Eastern European Member States.</p>

At the same time, however, the kind of Russia with which we cooperate is equally important. As the rapporteur notes, our cooperation should be based on common values, but the fact is that Russia is moving ever further away from such values as democracy and civil liberties. Common values are therefore a goal rather than a reality, and both the Council and the Commission should do everything in their power to ensure that this goal is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make is that the agreement signed in Moscow is a real step forward in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia. Amongst other things, it will make it possible for us to resolve local conflicts, such as those in Transnistria, Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the same time, however, no mention is made in this agreement of the Chechnya issue. This is absurd, as how can there be any question of forging a common policy with Russia or establishing a common area of freedom, security and justice if no reference is made to events in Chechnya? The same is true for energy policy, on the subject of which Mr Schmit said that there was a prospect of removing obstacles to energy cooperation. I should like to ask the Council and the Commission whether this means that they would be in favour of the Baltic pipeline. The latter would run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, and could facilitate a diversification of energy sources for various EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the success achieved by all of us will depend first and foremost upon the coherence of our common foreign and security policy, and the extent to which it takes into account the interests of all the 25 EU Member States. I would stress the word ‘all’, as we cannot afford to allow Russia to play off certain EU Member States against others. What kind of EU would we have then, and what kind of community?</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Poland, is essentially interested in cooperating closely with Russia. Yet for many years now, Russia has attempted to prove to the world, and to the European Union, that Poland is holding back dialogue between Russia and the West.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore be stated in plain terms that we are emphatically in favour of a pragmatic and coherent approach which involves working as partners, and which takes into account the interests of all the EU Member States.</p>

We did not see eye to eye on every aspect of the first draft, but Mrs Malmström managed to incorporate a great many of our ideas and to draft compromise amendments. This has resulted in a very broad consensus, and I should like to thank her on this score. I believe that the report we now have before us achieves a good balance between the views of those who believe that we should regard Russia first and foremost as a strategic partner, and of those who believe that democracy and human rights must be the focus of our relations with the country. I see no contradiction between these two approaches; in my opinion, it would be unfeasible to emphasise one and ignore the other. Furthermore, I believe that this is the message that emerges from this report.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no question that Russia is a strategic partner for the EU, but we would have preferred to see it actually acting as such during the events in Ukraine. Ukraine would also have been glad had this been the case, but unfortunately it was still too early for such a thing. We would be delighted to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to policies on Belarus, and if this were to happen there would surely be no limit to our success in developing democracy. The same applies to South Caucasus, and we would also be glad to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to Georgia. Yet such strategic partnerships must not be conducted on Russia’s terms, or even on Europe’s terms; they must be conducted in accordance with the terms laid down by the peoples of Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus. In my opinion, therefore, this is precisely the direction in which we must move. We must constantly remind Russia that we want to act as its partner, but the basic requirements for such a partnership must remain unaltered.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said that we must speak with one voice, and it is my belief that this House is prepared to do so. Should you run into any problems when dealing with the Council, I would advise you to ask this House for its assistance, as we will give you our full backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The history of relations between Latvia and Russia makes me cautious, in practice, in assessing the processes taking place in Russia now.

President Putin seriously overestimated his ability to impose his chosen candidate on the Ukrainian people, even if it meant rigging the election. He wrongly expected the same reaction as shown by the EU to the flawed election the previous year in Azerbaijan. Ukraine has now courageously sorted itself out and started out on an independent path – as has Georgia – and Russia, unsurprisingly, is not happy with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is Russia particularly pleased with the role played by the independent Baltic republics with their enhanced status in foreign affairs as full EU members. The statement by President Putin that they voluntarily agreed to be annexed by the Soviet Union is laughable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU remains deeply critical of the widespread atrocities in Chechnya, including the extrajudicial execution of Aslan Maskhadov. Russia, however, is fortunately now making some moves towards punishing those responsible for some of the atrocities. There remains strong appreciation of Russia’s internal struggle against fundamentalism and support for the global war against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I support a strong Russia with its recognised international borders, but say ‘hands off Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova’, and I call upon it to help solve the Transnistria question. I am also deeply worried by the rise in Russian anti<span class="bold">– </span>Semitism.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia remains the EU’s strategic energy supplier and giant immediate neighbour, so we must encourage dialogue and shared values and develop the four ‘common spaces’.

Relations with Russia and the Russian people must be strengthened in order to allow us to engage in economic cooperation and to work together to establish international norms in Eurasia. The European Union should pursue the goal of bringing Russia closer to the EU and to its standards and institutions. To this end, it is essential that the EU coordinate its external policies on Russia, both at EU institutional level and at Member State level. Relations with Russia should not be viewed as secondary to either short<span class="bold">–</span>term economic interests or negative historical experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian civil society should be a key partner for the European Union in its relations with the country, and we should support it in its efforts to promote democracy, media freedom and respect for human rights. Modern<span class="bold">-</span>day Russia is a heterogeneous country. On the one hand, it is fighting a post<span class="bold">–</span>colonial war in Chechnya and violates the fundamental human rights of those living in this region. On the other hand, however, it is a target for ruthless terrorist attacks, and a country that over the past 15 years has undergone impressive democratic transformation. Yet this country is under threat from the distinctive and authoritarian presidential system that is currently in place, as well as from state control over the media and violations of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Even as we level criticism at the system put in place by President Putin, however, we must never forget that there is also another Russia. This other Russia found its full expression in the thoughts and activities of Andrei Sakharov, who was both a great European and a great Russian. The real Russia today, or in other words the Russia of the Memorial Society and the PEN Club, is defending Russian democracy, and it expects the European Union to support and help it in its efforts to build Russian democracy and to bring Russia and the European Union closer together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Russia’s attitude in resolving the boundary issue with Latvia confirms the need for the report. Latvia lost part of its territory as a result of its occupation by the USSR.

In view of this stance by the Russian powers towards historical truth and the fact that discussions about the border agreement between Russia and Latvia, which have lasted ten years, have reached deadlock, the fact that in this report the European Parliament is calling on Russia to settle the border with Latvia fairly and equitably is to be highly valued. Unfortunately, Russia is still unable to demonstrate such a will.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Union not to shy away from acting as a mediator in the fair and equitable determination of a border agreement between Latvia and Russia, to refuse to yield in the face of Russia’s strength and blackmail, to assess Russia’s attitude towards those countries once in its sphere of influence from a position of goodwill as testimony to a responsible understanding concerning the need for reconciliation between Russia and the European Union countries, and to Russia’s understanding of democratic values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that all parties could unite in saying that German politicians are glad that, after many decades, good relations with Russia have been restored. If one is to calculate quite coldly, on the basis of our own interests and of the security interests of the new Member States, I believe that their security interests benefit more from these good relations than they would do if the situation were reversed. It follows, then, that it is negligent or worse to allow the EU to be used as a sort of trampoline, with the help of which one jumps up in the air in order to give the Russian bear a hefty thump on the nose.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Laschet’s earlier criticisms of didactic tendencies, and what Mr Brok had to say about keeping avenues of dialogue open. I have to say, though, to Mr Laschet, that there are two things he should not do. For a start, you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead. Secondly, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, for I am quite certain that summits would take place between Germany and Russia even if Germany had a CDU government – and who knows, we may even see such a thing in 20 years’ time. You should not try to imply that such summits would no longer happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time since the recent enlargement of the EU a resolution on this issue has been worked out, with us taking part in the work of this Parliament, the Parliament of a huge and powerful European Union. However, it has nothing to do with the settling of accounts with Russia; this is the recognition of Russia’s importance and a wish to see that country follow the main signposts of the transition to democracy, while searching for its own way. Can a country head towards democracy if the opposition in that country is weak and in decline, if freedom of press is restricted and the courts carry out the will of the authorities?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer is important for the entire European Union, for Russia’s neighbours in particular. Immense Asian Russia has been searching for a special road for hundreds of years, either getting closer to or more distant from Europe. Now Russia has an excellent opportunity to make a choice. It is very important to spell out the things which divide us, and to strive to diminish those differences and outline the things which unite us. We would like to cooperate with a neighbouring Russia, which is not just a strategic partner, but a reliable associate sharing our values and focussed in its search for the way ahead. I believe this would also be in Russia's interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No<span class="bold"> </span>one can doubt that Russia has a great deal of potential to play a decisive role in consolidating international security, stability, peace and a balanced international order.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that cooperation is needed in order to resolve international and regional crises within the framework of the UN and to prevent the imposition of unilateral solutions. The experience gained from joint participation in the Quartet to resolve the Palestinian problem, which resulted in the roadmap, should be applied to other regional problems, such as Kosovo, the crisis in the Caucasus and the crisis in Central Asia. There is, however, a lack of trust between the two sides which the enlargement of the European Union has exacerbated rather than reversed. Enlargement should be a bridge for cooperation; it should not create new divisive walls. From this point of view, the European Union and the new Member States have a great deal of responsibility. We cannot help to build strategic relations with Russia with the syndromes of fear and the experience of a traumatic past. The crucial factor for the future of relations between the European Union and Russia is the configuration of a joint European strategy in which all the Member States will talk the same language, not on the basis of national priorities on individual interests. We, as the European Union, need a cohesive and integrated strategy with vision and inspiration in our relations with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The important thing is to have a frank dialogue and a dialogue on every question. That also means a dialogue on human rights questions and, for instance, on difficult issues like Chechnya. I must say that we have had this very clear and frank dialogue. President Putin himself has been very open. So, I see movement, although it is not yet sufficient or exactly what we want. We must continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This interdependence means that we must go further. For instance, on Chechnya, we have spoken clearly about the necessary political solution: there has to be territorial integrity but, at the same time, there must be some sort of autonomy for the people there and then there have to be free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Commission feel that we must do something for the population: not only provide humanitarian aid, but also assist in reconstruction. We are thinking of technical assistance, as I said: training for medical doctors and teachers in the EU Member States; scholarships for students; the provision of medical and teaching equipment. There must be job creation and new activities for the future generation. These are <span class="italic">very</span> concrete actions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of history, we know that there are still some very difficult, delicate issues between the Baltic States and Russia. It is really up to the historians to clarify the past so that our people can then reflect on the dark pages of European history. But our priority must be to look to the future and, in this regard, I repeat exactly what I said: we have to raise every question openly, whatever it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Baku<span class="bold">–</span>Tbilisi<span class="bold">–</span>Ceyhan pipeline, I can only say that it has been inaugurated today with the strong support of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will go on taking implementing action and we will take your comments into account, including comments on the need to guarantee human rights, democracy and stability. However, at the same time, we must also look to Russia, our strategic partner, for solutions to problems in its neighbourhood and for solutions to problems with ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
