<p class="contents">Last year, this Parliament was consulted twice about the establishment of a system for comparing fingerprints. In principle, the system is intended to correctly implement the Dublin Convention. On 13 April 1999, this Parliament rejected the Council’s proposal to extend the Eurodac system to illegal immigrants by means of a protocol. This Parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of Amsterdam. We were once again told that this system has to be developed in order to correctly implement the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">This seems all very well to me, with the limits introduced by Parliament in its last report, with the amendments which ranged from our reservations about the inclusion of children under 14 in the system to the request that this Eurodac system be only applied to the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted, I would like to ask the Council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with Parliament. This is not a trivial question. We are beginning to build and implement the instruments for the ‘communitisation’ of the area of freedom, security and justice and, as we will never tire of saying in this House, this cannot be done without the national parliaments and without the European Parliament, because these issues are far too important to the citizens not to be endorsed through a strong social consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question I would like to ask the Council is whether it agrees that this system should be administrated by the Commission, in which case the Commission should be provided with adequate staff and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the content of the report, the non-acceptance of Parliament’s amendments and the ambiguity of some of its provisions, as well as certain information that I have received, lead me to ask you, and to insist once again, what exactly are the Council’s intentions with regard to the scope and functions of the Eurodac system. I would like to ask why other foreign nationals have been included and, especially, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether the Council has any intention to extend the use of the Eurodac system beyond the application of the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I await your responses to this question and I would like to thank you once again for coming to answer this oral question before the debate on the new Eurodac Regulations, which I hope will also reach this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all managed very well to really work together with you, and the same applies of course to Commissioner Vitorino. But when it comes to EURODAC, we have a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We here in Parliament have passed a resolution and have made clear why we cannot accept EURODAC in the form which the Council and the Commission wish it to take. And we have given our reasons. We have humane reasons, we have reasons when it comes to children, as far as the age limit is concerned; for example we cannot accept the age limit of 14. We highlighted all these problems in a resolution by Parliament. For this reason, it is of course most important for us, for my group, to see how seriously you take Parliament, how you deal with our proposals and, in the final analysis, we hope that we will continue to be able to report gladly and proudly on how well we are cooperating together. The question is whether you are willing to lend us an ear when something gives us cause for concern and we urgently need your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It started back in Dublin in 1990. In November 1999, we here in Parliament, and I assume you too Commissioner, believed that we were on the home stretch and were finally going to be able to implement EURODAC. Set targets were tabled on several occasions and, on balance, we welcomed the fact, and I personally was pleased, and that’s a rare occurrence, when you said, following the vote in Parliament, that you would not accept the proposals adopted by a majority in Parliament which we, I should add, had voted against. That too was a very positive aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I would have been pleased to see this system implemented for the simple reason that it is this system alone which makes Dublin enforceable and because it allows the jurisdiction of the Member State responsible for the asylum procedure to be established unequivocally, thereby indirectly dividing the burden to a certain extent. Plus, we could then prevent multiple applications for asylum and abuse of the asylum system and this, in turn, would allow us, as it were, to fight illegal immigration indirectly. In other words, it is, as a whole, a system which must be seen as very positive and absolutely necessary in the context of asylum and immigration policy and the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What filled me with consternation was the fact that the Council then upset the whole applecart at its meeting on 2 December by refusing to accept that implementing powers should remain with the Commission, i.e. that the competent regulatory committee should be able to act under the chairmanship of the Commission. The upshot of this was that we failed to achieve what we wanted to do, i.e. to communitise the system; on the contrary, the Council upset our plans by more or less announcing yet again that it was staking its claim. As a result, it is not the Commission which controls this instrument in the interests of the Community; on the contrary the initiative is again with the Council and, as a result, the Commission and, in the final analysis, Parliament too are excluded. We will not and cannot accept this because it involves consequences which are so far-reaching that, in the end, there will be no control over the efficiency of the system, it will no longer be possible to collate statistics for the purposes of analysis and action and a delay has been caused which is absolutely unacceptable on account of the fact that we need this system.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to you is this: when can we really expect to see the EURODAC system which we have waited so long for up and running? How will the system actually be configured? Will it comply with the rules and with our requests for the Commission to be fully responsible for implementation, because then we would have achieved our own necessary goal; we would have re-Europeanised one part, because it makes sense here to actually implement this communitisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall reply very directly to the questions that have been raised, so as to avoid any possible doubt about the Council’s position, and I think it is indeed important for that position to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the scope of the Eurodac system, I would like to recall that Article 1 of the proposal for a regulation on establishing this system is very clear, so let me quote it: “A system known as ‘Eurodac’ is hereby established, the purpose of which shall be to assist in determining which Member State is to be responsible pursuant to the Dublin Convention,” I repeat, “pursuant to the Dublin Convention, for examining an application for asylum lodged in a Member State, and otherwise to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention under the conditions set out in this Regulation”. This is the sole objective of the regulation, which is an instrument pursuant to the Dublin Convention and which goes no further than that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the role of the European Commission, Article 3 of the proposal for a regulation clearly defines that a Central Unit shall be set up within the Commission. Furthermore, the Commission has, as we know, started to work on this, and preparations for establishing a Central Unit are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the role of the European Parliament, I would like to clarify something that can only be the result of a misunderstanding. I would like to make it very clear that in no way has the Council stated its opposition to all Parliament’s amendments, nor has it called upon the European Commission to come up with any new proposals. Some of Parliament’s amendments were in fact incorporated into the proposal for a regulation, which is a point I wish to stress. In addition, I would like to remind you that all the Justice and Home Affairs Council’s proposals on this matter have been presented to this House, which has, in fact, given its opinion on this matter on three occasions: 15 January 1998, 18 March 1999 and 11 November 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, as you know, and for reasons that are not entirely relevant to this issue, but have more to do with other circumstances of a political nature, it has not been possible to reach a consensus within the Council on the new proposal to be submitted to this House. We hope that this will happen shortly, perhaps even during the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other questions raised here, the first was the minimum age for taking fingerprints, which has been set at 14 years. I recognise that there are some concerns about this, but I would like to say that this is in line with the practices followed in Member States, which in some cases even allow fingerprints to be taken from children under 14. I would like to highlight an important aspect which was probably not taken into consideration when discussing this age limit: an ever increasing number of applications for asylum are submitted by minors, and such situations need to be monitored using technical procedures of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the involvement of the European Parliament and of the courts, I think that Title IV of the Treaty of Amsterdam is sufficiently clear about the role of this Parliament and the Court of Justice in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the need to safeguard privacy is properly covered by the provisions of Article 18 of the proposal for a regulation, to which I would like to draw your attention, and which, in addition, refers to the rights already enshrined in Directive 95/46. Furthermore, as a result of Article 1 of the proposal for a regulation, and I think it is very important that this should be reiterated here, it is clear that the application of Eurodac will, at all times, be governed by the principles enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I believe that these points mean we can say that this is a safe system without any aspects that could jeopardise citizens’ rights. But we have to recognise that the creation of a set of EU mechanisms for regulating all these issues relating to applications for asylum needs to be subject to rigorous technical scrutiny, failing which it could be perceived as implying a loss of citizens’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Social Democrats are divided, I make no bones about the fact, as to how to deal with fingerprinting of under 18-year olds. Some members are saying we should not fingerprint fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds. I personally take a different view on this. You cannot advocate reducing the voting age to sixteen and still say that an eighteen-year-old should not be fingerprinted. It is incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">It comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law. If you guarantee that the Council has no objection to leaving implementing powers definitively with the Commission and allowing us in Parliament to exercise a control function, at least in the area of Commission jurisdiction, then that is considerable progress. However, the Council has not so far given us to understand this in so many words, which is why I listened to what you said with pleasure. Because I should like to draw your attention to the following point: if we create systems at European level which can directly violate people’s basic freedoms – and the anthropometric treatment of a person, compulsory treatment of a person is a violation of his individual rights – if we create institutions at European level which have these rights then the Executive must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the people affected by the measures must have legal recourse, both of which are lacking in almost every system which we have created within the framework of internal security in the European Union. There is a lack of parliamentary scrutiny and no precise guaranteed legal recourse. It is there in principle, but it has never been accurately described. The same applies to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore say that if implementing powers remain with the Commission, if the regulatory committee is set up under the chairmanship of the Commission, then we agree. If not, then we must tell the Council that there is no question of the Council taking implementing powers away from the Commission, not if it expects the Community budget to finance the system. Otherwise Parliament would have to reconsider the budget and the question of financing the system from the community budget. And believe me, we shall do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that some have not and will not, so this means that the proposed regulation goes beyond the strict terms of Dublin by guessing at or anticipating the existence of an asylum application. Thus the Dublin Convention is, in the words of the UK House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, a shaky edifice on which to construct a system for taking and exchanging fingerprint data on those who have not yet made or may not make an asylum application. This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply. Member States are required to fingerprint every third-country national over 14 who is apprehended <span class="italic">in connection with</span> the irregular crossing of their border – that is not very precise. Fingerprinting is a serious invasion of privacy and the compatibility of such requirements with the European Convention on Human Rights needs to be carefully weighed. I am not sure that this has really been done.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also data protection worries, which is why Parliament wanted to extend the provisions on erasing data to include, for instance, those who obtain any kind of legal status to remain in a Member State even if not full refugee status. I am glad to see the amended proposal takes up Parliament's demand to erase the data when an individual has got a subsidiary or temporary form of protection, but could I enquire whether this would cover for example – in the system I know best – the UK's exceptional leave to remain?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, whatever the justification for widening the Eurodac fingerprinting system to some categories of illegal immigrants, I am personally not convinced that this proposal is legally watertight. Are the Council and the Commission so convinced?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls. A common immigration law means that we have no more internal borders and take responsibility for the people entering the European Union at the external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly clear that there is abuse, for example in connection with asylum claims. The number of people applying for asylum on grounds which have nothing to do with political persecution far outweighs the number of applicants recognised as victims of political persecution. Abuse in this connection means not only that asylum is sought on non-existent grounds but also that the same applicants make applications on these grounds to several countries. We will only be able to control this abuse if we at long last implement the EURODAC fingerprinting system, which we have been waiting such a long time for, and if the Council finally decides to allow this system to enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already proven its efficacy on several counts, and it is essential if asylum is to gain acceptance. We therefore advise the Council in the strongest terms to make its decisions so that EURODAC, the system which allows fingerprinting throughout Europe, can become a fact of life. That is the task now before the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is still unacceptable to us as it stigmatises third country nationals and tends to criminalise them. Given that we are now discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and yesterday, for instance, a report on human rights, could we really live within a fortress Europe outside, or even inside, which rights might be being violated?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this draft regulation concerns us basically because we feel that it is not needed yet. It is, we feel, putting the cart before the horse. We are using and establishing instruments before we have developed a proper harmonised policy on the right to freedom of movement, the right to live as a family and the right of asylum. We should start by harmonising this policy. We can look at the instruments for implementation and control after that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a third point which particularly concerns us is the dismissal of Parliament’s opinion. This raises a vital question about the democratic credit granted to the Members of the European Parliament. It is a shame that we are currently being given the impression that we serve no useful purpose. We are told that this is just a case of abstention but this is actually the norm as Members’ opinions are not being taken into account.</p>

With Eurodac, the Commission and the Council are, in my view, going too far in their desire to monitor asylum seekers and other citizens of third countries who cross the border into Fortress Europe. The Eurodac initiative is a series of absurdities and outrages. Firstly, keeping the fingerprints of minors – right down to 14 years of age – who have not committed any criminal offence contravenes the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which asks us to protect children and to respect an age of criminal responsibility of 18 years if we ourselves have not legally specified another age – something which, as far as I know, the Union has not done. Keeping fingerprints for up to ten years, even if the person concerned has not committed any offence and even if they have perhaps, into the bargain, obtained legal residence in the area of the Union, is a violation of the demand under the European Convention on Human Rights for respect for private life. To confuse asylum seekers with illegal immigrants contravenes the Convention on Refugees. Those human and fundamental rights which are so much talked about have no value if we are not in a position to guarantee them in practice, and on behalf of those who penetrate Fortress Europe as well. The impression with which those people travel home, or which they obtain while they are here, of the “area of freedom, security and justice” does not reflect those values which, on state occasions, are otherwise designated as global and universal. What I would therefore urge the Commission and the Council to do is to allow Eurodac to die a peaceful death, as it deserves to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot imagine that either the Council or the Commission might wish to construct this system in such a way that it could include restrictions of any kind upon the freedom of law-abiding citizens.

<p class="contents">I personally am among those who have serious reservations about the system. Numerous facets of the system already exacerbate our concerns regarding possible violations of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, given that it calls for 14-year-old children to be fingerprinted.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, the fingerprinting system per se has negative associations with criminal investigations by police authorities and criminal offences. In other words, extending the system to asylum seekers automatically identifies refugees and immigrants as a whole with crime and illegality, which I think is quite unfair and goes beyond every concept of international law and respect for human rights as demanded in the Geneva Convention, the 50th anniversary of which we celebrated in this morning’s extended debate here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the system does not guarantee 100% identification, as we know from numerous criminal investigations and, as such, we cannot consider that its application will facilitate the implementation of the Dublin Convention and help to prevent abuse of the right to asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the European Parliament is calling for the right to exercise parliamentary scrutiny, in which case the Council and the Commission will have the final word on the matter. However, I think that the best thing the European Commission and the Council can do is to institute a common asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian and democratic values and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to confirm, as the representative of the Council has already said, that there is a problem concerning the territorial application of the Eurodac regulation. I can also confirm that the Council did not ask the Commission to come forward with a revised proposal. Nevertheless, this is a very sensitive issue, as the debate has already shown, and one of the few cases where the three institutions do not have the same position, as I very clearly stated before Parliament. The Commission, in this case, has a different position from both the Council and Parliament. That is why, although not being asked to come forward with a new proposal, we decided that to clarify the political options that are on the table we should do that extra work and come before the Council with a revised proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In its revised proposal the Commission takes on board the solution proposed by Parliament that the data should be deleted from the base as soon as someone is recognised as a refugee. On the other hand, we did not subscribe to the idea of Parliament about the age limit for fingerprinting. We considered that 14 years old is an adequate solution. Perhaps this is because I come from a country – which the representative of the Council also comes from – where our children, when they are ten years old, in order to get their first identity card, are fingerprinted. It is inconceivable for me that my country is one which criminalises all children of 10 years of age just because they are fingerprinted for their first identity card. I still remember that it was a major event in my youth to get my own identity card.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I recognise this is a very sensitive question. Consequently, the Commission believes it should clarify to Parliament two very strict and clear ideas. First, we should not ask Eurodac to give answers that Eurodac cannot give. That is why we consider that some of the questions Baroness Ludford raised and some of the issues that were raised by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery – which are very important – have to be addressed in the context of the regulation on temporary protection and on subsidiary protection that the Commission is actively preparing. We will come to Parliament and the Council with proposals in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just achieved, this week, a working document to re-evaluate the Dublin Convention itself. We want to launch a debate not only on the technical questions of Eurodac but also on the essential solutions to the current Dublin Convention. We do not want to lose time. We want to have as broad a picture as possible for all instruments that concern asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the point of difference between the Commission and the Council? Of course, the Council has been generous in the sense that it has given to the Commission management and the technical functioning of the system. But there is a point where the Commission does not agree with the Council. We do not agree that the Council should reserve for itself the powers of implementation of the system. According to the comitology agreement, there are not sufficient grounds for the Council to reserve the implementing powers for itself rather than delegating them to the Commission. The proposal of the Commission is that the executive powers, the implementing powers of the system, should be delegated to the Commission, associated with a committee composed of representatives from all Member States. In our opinion this will be a more coherent and transparent way of managing the system and reinforcing the capability of Parliament to scrutinise the way the Commission manages and develops the Eurodac system.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe through this balanced solution it will be possible to address in a more relaxed and trusting way some of the reservations and political doubts that have been raised by several Members of Parliament during this debate. Maybe I am being stubborn but this is what I sincerely believe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
