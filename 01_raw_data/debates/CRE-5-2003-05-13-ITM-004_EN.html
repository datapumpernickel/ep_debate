<p class="contents">I should like to record briefly the background and purposes of the reform under discussion today. With this proposal the Commission is keeping to the commitments it made in the White Paper on European Governance and in its action plan on better regulation, namely, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to give the Council and the European Parliament equal rights in monitoring and overseeing the executive. The two branches of the legislature must be placed on an equal footing, as supervisors of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers in matters subject to codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should, as co-legislator, be given the right to object not just to the scope of powers delegated to the Commission under codecision – the current right of scrutiny granted in Council Decision 1999/468/EC – but also to the substance of a measure implementing a codecision act.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the hope of the Commission that such reform will ultimately pave the way to a wider review based on Treaty changes. To this end, the Commission made concrete proposals to amend Article 202 of the Treaty in the framework of the European Convention, notably by introducing the concept of delegation of legislative powers in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that a temporary reform of the system is all the more necessary as the uncertainty surrounding the ratification by 25 Member States of the new constitutional treaty is not inconsiderable. The Commission therefore welcomes the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the proposal and hopes the Chamber will confirm this favourable stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I very much welcome the Commission proposal which, if adopted and adjusted slightly, would bring forward a substantial improvement to the current system and indeed could form the basis of solving once and for all this problem of the so-called comitology system that has been a difficulty for years.</p>
<p class="contents">All systems, be they national parliamentary or European Parliamentary systems, have methods of delegating powers to the executive: implementing powers, secondary legislation – call them what you like. I will not get into a theological argument about the definition of such powers. But it is normal practice. What is not normal is the way we do it in the European Union where we set up, alongside the Commission, committees of national civil servants which, in some cases, have the powers to block the Commission. Indeed so many committees have been set up that the name comitology was invented to describe a system that was so difficult to fathom and so difficult to get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">The system was greatly improved in 1999 when the revised system was adopted by the Council: greater transparency, a greater guarantee that Parliament has access to all the proposals and all the documents. That is very good, but it has left two fundamental problems. Firstly, the Commission's powers are scrutinised only by committees of national civil servants, which alone have the power to block the Commission and call back the decision to the legislative authority. Secondly, if a decision is called back, it only goes to one branch of the legislative authority, namely the Council, even when it is codecision legislation adopted in the first place by Parliament and the Council jointly. That is something we find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We want equal rights of call back for Parliament and the Council – Parliament by an absolute majority, the Council by a qualified majority, as is the bottom line now when a matter goes back to the Council. We should have the right to call back an implementing measure. If it is called back there should be equal rights of scrutiny for both Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal almost achieves that. It comes very close to doing that. The fly in the ointment is the word 'possibly', which is in the Commission's draft. In other words the Commission, if we object to a draft, will possibly amend it to take account of our objections or refer it to the legislative procedure. In my view and that of the committee, the word 'possibly' should go because only then will we really have a basis for a definitive solution to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission insist on the word 'possibly'? It says that the current legal basis of the Treaties does not allow it to go any further. I beg to disagree. If you look at the fact that the legislation is adopted anyway, in the first place, under codecision by Parliament and the Council, it is up to Parliament and the Council to put in place any system, and any checks and balances that they want. If one argues that such checks and balances must conform to Article 202, then let us look at that article. It says: 'The Council may impose certain requirements in respect of the exercise of implementing powers.' 'Certain requirements' is the wording on which the whole comitology system is based. If such a complex system can be set up on the basis of that clause in the Treaty, there is absolutely nothing to prevent the Council from setting up a different system – the one which we are advocating – that gives the Council and Parliament equal rights to call back and equal rights to scrutinise. Article 202, in other words, is much more flexible than the Commission's legal service seems to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission to accept our amendment concerning the word 'possibly'. I give notice now that if the Commission does not accept that amendment then, before the final vote, I as rapporteur will move that the issue be referred back to committee, where we will pursue further negotiations with the Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also sought to amend the Commission proposal to make it slightly more flexible. This is something I hope the Commission will welcome. We propose to give the Commission the right simply to withdraw an implementing measure if Parliament objects to it or indeed if the Council objects to it. This is common sense. Some implementing measures are discretionary, not obligatory. If we think that the Commission does not need to adopt an implementing measure at the time or of the style that the Commission envisages, and we object to it, the Commission should be able to withdraw it. That is already provided for in our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the PPE-DE is opposed to that amendment. I look forward to hearing their arguments on this, but it is in conformity with what Parliament adopted in the Bourlanges report only a few months ago. We similarly propose to give the Commission the right to maintain an implementing measure, provisionally, when Parliament has objected to it, pending a full legislative procedure to review, amend or repeal the implementing measure – again an element of flexibility that I expect the Commission to welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we propose to keep the special procedures that were agreed under the so-called Lamfalussy procedures. I gather that is not a matter of controversy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which has a lot of experience with comitology, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has begun to deal with the Lamfalussy procedures, fully support the approach that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken on this. If we manage to find a solution to this issue now we will have eliminated a problem that has messed up and held up numerous legislative procedures, and we will have removed one of the obstacles to Parliament being willing to delegate far more implementing powers to the Commission than is the case under these procedures. If we have the right to call back in the way that is envisaged we will be able to delegate much more than we can now, knowing that we have the safety of being able to scrutinise and call back if necessary. That is something that all should welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing – and this was of course mentioned at the end of the previous intervention – I am focusing in particular on the Lamfalussy process and the Lamfalussy procedures for legislation creating the internal market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Lamfalussy Group, our aim is to produce legislation in this sector that is close to the market and practicable; that is what all of us want and are working for. However, we must of course take a close look at what form the procedures may take in the future. Precisely in our role as Parliament we need to ask ourselves whether the future procedures also have sufficient democratic legitimacy, because of course we are also getting increasing numbers of so-called soft laws, that is legislation at international level. I only need to mention Basel II or the International Accounting Standards, which will soon become law in Europe once the necessary steps have been taken by the European Commission and after adoption in the Council and Parliament. If in the future all of this were to happen in a comitology procedure, with a framework directive only giving general instructions, we would have a basic problem of legitimacy, and Parliament reserves the right to have a say on these very important issues in the future. For this reason I can only support the rapporteur, Mr Corbett.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for us in the European Parliament to retain our influence at European level. This does not mean that we also wish to discuss the technical details in the plenary or in committee. That is not our point. But if we feel that provisions are heading in the wrong direction it is vital that we be able to say so, and for this to happen it is essential that the constitution being drafted by the Convention give us a right to call back in the future, which means that if we are not happy with something we can recall it, change its focus and correct it. That is why it is essential for the Commission and the Convention to support us here so that we can have the relevant provisions added. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The PPE-DE approves the main thrust of the report and in particular it supports the idea that, in the case of a disagreement between Parliament and the Commission on a draft implementing text, the latter should not be able to override Parliament’s opposition. If the Commission did not agree with Parliament on this point, the PPE-DE would gladly support the request that could be made by the rapporteur for a referral to committee.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points on which we disagree with Mr Corbett’s report, however. Firstly, it lays down that if Parliament does not agree to the text proposed by the Commission, the latter may simply withdraw its text without preparing a new one and without taking any legislative initiative. This power seems to us to be completely excessive. It is equivalent to an authorisation to go on strike as far as the production of implementing texts is concerned, and we cannot support it. The aim of our requests for a separate vote is to rule out such a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Corbett’s report suggests that, if the Commission were to undertake a new legislative initiative, because it thought it would be impossible to overcome its disagreement with Parliament simply by amending its text, the text prepared by the Commission would be provisionally applicable until the adoption of the new legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that this is acceptable. In fact, it seems to us to be an abuse to allow the Commission to override, for a very long period, the opposition of Parliament, even when the disagreement between the two institutions is so serious and so deep-seated that it cannot be overcome by a simple amendment to the draft, but requires recourse to a legislative procedure.</p>

This is not exactly a straightforward subject. Perhaps the easiest way to explain it – since we always have a few visitors with us at this time of day – is to say that we are talking about building a bridge. The Corbett report is an attempt to build a bridge out of this European confusion of non-competencies or mysterious clan competencies, which mean, as Mr Radwan said, that all of a sudden rules directly affecting the lives of millions of people are adopted at a lower level, when there is no direct democratic legitimacy for this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is to a large extent due to the history of the European Union and its failure to have a clear separation of powers. This state of affairs means that many issues fall in a grey area and are delegated. In some cases laws are still made by civil servants; in certain areas this is a practice that is even on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the European Parliament is putting up a fight is, I think, a historic achievement and also legitimises its existence. But what is crucial now is undoubtedly for the Convention, which is of course occupying a great deal of our attention at the present time, to make it much more clear what happens where, and it is of course vital that this include the power for the European Parliament – this representative body of the people – to be able to call back such implementing powers once they have been delegated. The success of this project will depend on this, but also on whether we can find the words and expressions – once Mr Corbett has built this bridge – to explain this to the public and the electorate in a way that they can actually understand, so as to bring clarity and transparency to the issue, so that there is nowhere that anyone can hide any tricks. With this in mind I would stick to my <span class="italic">ceterum censeo</span>, that there can be no democracy without transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, Mr Corbett wants to give the Parliament equivalency with the Council, suggesting that somehow this improves the accountability of the system and by inference its democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, the Council reflects the primacy of the nation-states, in theory at least, and should have the final say on whether a legislative instrument should have legal force.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, on the one hand, the problem is that the secretive and complex system adopted by the Council does not facilitate external scrutiny, which therefore negates any resemblance of accountability and therefore democracy. On the other hand, the Parliament, despite its pretensions, lacks the European demos and therefore cannot claim to be a democratic institution. On that basis, the current state of affairs is not satisfactory, but nor is what is proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council Decision of 1999 reduced the Babylonian confusion of over 20 variants of such committees in the Commission to three procedures, namely management, regulatory and advisory procedures. The decision also laid down criteria for deciding which committee procedure was appropriate. All of the relevant European Union legislation, consisting of several hundred directives and regulations, had to be brought into line with it. Mrs Frassoni’s report in March 2003 – just a few weeks ago – brought this work to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of our consultations today would be that once again all of the European Union's legislation, that is once again several hundred legal instruments, would have to be brought into line with the new texts. Should the Convention – and here I am talking about Article 202 – propose alternative solutions to the ones that we are discussing today, then this process of adapting all European legislation would have to be repeated. Once again, as with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are only debating an interim solution. This is expressed very clearly in Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In my judgment, the Commission proposal does not enable us to achieve the objectives of transparency and improved legislative supervision of the Commission when it enacts implementing provisions. On the contrary, the proposed changes are designed to remodel Parliament's existing right of supervision as a hearing procedure pure and simple. <span class="italic">De facto</span> the Commission's proposal amounts to abolishing the management procedure, which also considerably curtails the Council’s and the Member States' influence and supervisory powers. This might well not matter to us in Parliament if our influence and supervisory powers were enhanced accordingly. That is the intention of Parliament's amendments. But the Commission, as Mr Corbett has already said, is refusing to delete an essential word, namely 'possibly'. This means that in the future it may only possibly take into account the substantive demands made by Parliament with regard to the implementing legislation. We cannot support this as a Parliament and are in complete agreement with the rapporteur here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the end result will indeed move in this direction. Why are we doing this? That too has already been mentioned. We are doing it because the old system of comitology has essentially resulted in underground law, produced by way of methods that are undemocratic, and above all, lacking in transparency. No one in the outside world knows what is done, how it is done or why it is done. Above all, no one in the outside world knows what positions have been put forward here, by whom or why. We have to change this. That is why we will, in the Convention, be abolishing the old comitology system, but – and this too has already been mentioned – this is only possible if we have something with which to replace it. We need delegated lawmaking, but we need delegated lawmaking with clear responsibilities, with clear rules of delegation, with mandates that are clearly understood, and above all with the possibility of recall, an equal right of recall for both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I have already referred several times to our discussions in the Convention. Our concern is to ensure that the people of Europe have a clear picture of who is exercising legislative powers, why and for what reason, and the results that emerge on this point will soon be available as a constitutional proposal. This does not however make the work on the Corbett report superfluous; quite the opposite. Until we have included this result in the constitution and implemented it, we need the results of the Corbett report, which are to a large extent along the same lines as what has been said in the Convention. With this in mind not only do we congratulate the rapporteur but we also hope that the resulting proposals will be accepted as unanimously as possible and that an appropriate reform of the way in which this important issue is dealt with will allow them to replace the old, undemocratic system of comitology for the next few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly the question as to whether this is an interim solution. In my view, the Commission proposal with our amendments can be the basis for a solution to the comitology problem that is compatible both with the current treaty and with what is likely to come out of the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Convention must do its work and get rid of the apparent contradictions between Articles 202 and 251 of the Treaty, and perhaps put some of the principles governing the delegation of implementing powers into the Treaty and into the constitution itself, but in my view what we are doing here could be entirely convergent with the work going on in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, despite the great convergence we have achieved in general, I would like to mention the issue of the two points which, according to Mr Bourlanges, the PPE-DE Group intends to vote against.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say I disagree with the PPE-DE Group on this and I would point out that the position that I am defending is based on what was adopted by Parliament in Mr Bourlanges' own report. So I am consistent with what is in Parliament's position up to now, and, indeed, in our own Rules of Procedure, where we have called upon the President of Parliament to ask the Commission to withdraw or modify any implementing measure that Parliament objects to, or to bring forward a legislative proposal. So I am on the solid ground of what Parliament has consistently argued for over time in this and I would hope that the PPE-DE Group would rethink its position before we vote in half an hour's time.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, on the question of the provisional adoption of a text pending the legislative procedure, this is important in certain circumstances in order to avoid a legal vacuum. The measure applies provisionally while Parliament and the Council go through a legislative procedure to review it, amend it or repeal it, depending on what we decide to do. But it can also be important to have a stopgap solution without a legal vacuum pending that legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I am asking for a menu of options. If Parliament or Council objects to an implementing measure that the Commission has put forward, the Commission can either withdraw it – I think it has that right implicitly under the Treaty anyway but let us make that explicit – or it can amend it to take account of our objections, or it can put forward a legislative proposal. If it does the latter it can apply the measure provisionally, if this is necessary to avoid a legal vacuum, or not if that is not necessary. That range of opportunities is, I think, appropriate. We should maintain the full list and I hope the PPE-DE Group will rethink its position and vote accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as possible, the Commission will take into account the detailed amendments proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. The Commission can accept, in whole or in part, Amendments Nos 1, 2 (in part), 4, 7, 8, 11 (in part), 13, 14, 18 and 19. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 10 or 11 (in part), as they could complicate the Commission's negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal aims to give the European Parliament and the Council equal rights as co-legislators in controlling the Commission; but the proposal cannot go further than or beyond the scope of the present Treaty, which does not provide for explicit delegation of legislative power to the Commission. The Commission, as the sole executive, should be able to retain full responsibility for adopting executive instruments. This political responsibility goes hand in hand with the freedom of the Commission to adopt a decision, taking on board or not the objections raised by the legislator. The deletion of 'possibly' would tie the hands of the Commission and prevent it from exercising its responsibility as the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">The withdrawal option, as formulated in Mr Corbett's Amendments Nos 3, 10 and 11, would effectively amount to replacing the freedom of adoption by the Commission by an explicit withdrawal or non-action by the Commission. If the Commission's views are not in line with those of the legislator, the Commission would be obliged to renounce the adoption of an implementing measure. Substitution of the Commission's responsibility and freedom to adopt an implementing measure via the non-action option would also send the wrong political signal to stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is, on the contrary, based on the assumption that action is needed and that the Commission will take responsibility for it. Given the scope afforded by the current Treaty, these amendments are therefore not acceptable to the Commission. The proposal indeed goes as far as possible towards granting the European Parliament the control rights that, as a co-legislator, it should possess.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform, as I have just mentioned, cannot go as far as a more thoroughgoing reform conducted in the process of amending the Treaty. In the framework of the European Convention, the Commission has explicitly suggested that the Council and the European Parliament should, under delegation of legislative powers, have the possibility to oppose a text proposed by the Commission. In this scenario the latter would indeed either renounce its text, modify it or present a legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I can assure you that the Commission will endeavour to achieve progress on this issue in the Council. I would like to conclude that the Commission needs Parliament's support in negotiating the strengthening of the European Parliament's prerogatives with the Council. I am confident that the Commission can count on Parliament's continued support in the process of clarifying the roles and competences of the executive and the legislator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
