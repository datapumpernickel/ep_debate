It lies on the Silk Road, and, ever mindful of its historical heritage, plays a key geostrategic role at the point where Europe meets the Middle East and Asia. The Uzbek people and the country’s rich culture mean that it is destined to play a key part in establishing an international political order based on peace, democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Islam Karimov’s authoritarian regime is stifling the democratic ambitions of the Uzbek people. It violates fundamental human rights, and was responsible for the Andijan massacre. Last Saturday, 22 October 2005, an opposition leader, the businessman Sanjar Umarov, was taken into custody. There have been alarming reports from his lawyer, Vitaly Krasilovsky, about the humiliating treatment of Mr Umarov during his stay in custody. Mr Krasilovsky is concerned about the well-being of his client, since he was only allowed to visit him in prison for a few minutes, and Mr Umarov was incapable of providing coherent answers to his questions during this time. This is one of many violations of human rights by the Karimov regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot remain unmoved by the situation in Uzbekistan. Our actions must be geared towards Uzbek civil society, and they must serve to establish good relations with the Uzbek people, as well as helping those who have suffered political persecution under the authoritarian regime. A visit by Parliament representatives to Uzbekistan remains a matter of fundamental importance. The Uzbek authorities must agree to our visit to Andijan, and to meetings with representatives of the media, the opposition and NGOs. If I may, I should like to express my hope that the good relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan will continue to flourish further, since these relations will boost the development and prosperity of the Uzbek people. They will also promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in Uzbekistan and in Central Asia as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, of course, have acknowledged the presence of the Commissioner the last time I spoke, but I will this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on the motion on Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan is a large and very influential country in Central Asia. Its stability directly impinges on the whole region and the EU has rightly attempted to build contacts and a relationship with this geographically close and significant neighbour. For me, however, this motion has one main focus: to ask again what happened in Andijan last May and to make a further call for an open and independent inquiry. There seems to be a view that, by asking for the truth to be established, we are in some way taking sides against the Uzbek authorities. The EU has human rights and international law at the centre of its value system and it is our responsibility to call for the truth behind this tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, there are three versions of the ‘truth’. Firstly, the official Uzbek and the President Karimov version, according to which the killings were ‘a measured response to an Islamist uprising where 187 criminals were killed’. Next, there is the media and NGO version, which reports a bloodbath where women and children were mowed down by armed police, bodies were dragged to a school nearby and left lying there until the following day, some of them not dead, and then taken to hospital. We do not even know the numbers that were killed. Reports vary between 500 and 1500 people. Thirdly, there are the locals in Andijan, most of them silenced or suffering from amnesia, basically afraid to speak out because some who have done so have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must insist on an independent inquiry and we must take action that will ensure that, if we are refused that, it will have implications for the relationship between Uzbekistan and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is creating his own version of the truth. President Karimov is creating this truth by openly violating human rights, erasing traces of killings and neutralising witnesses and their relatives. It seems that there can only be one truth in Uzbekistan <span class="bold">–</span> the one thoroughly censored by the authorities. Terrorism and economic crime <span class="bold">–</span> these are the two vague labels which are used to conceal the open and violent treatment of so-called enemies of the state. Nevertheless, I believe that there must be a distinct line between ensuring security and repression. Since it was banned, the opposition has taken on a radical form. Social injustice and the repression of diversity of opinion encourage religious extremism. It can be acknowledged that Uzbekistan is an appealing target for Islamic extremists; however, such actions by the authorities do not stop Islamic radicalism, as only democracy and an independent judiciary can help to fight radicalism, not repression. Mr President, Members of Parliament, I urge you to vote for the resolution today, as I believe it is a further investment in trying to encourage diversity of opinion among the citizens of Uzbekistan, together with free speech and human rights.

There, it was not democracy that triumphed, but rather a group of people who had gained experience in the old state apparatus and the intelligence services. Having no objective other than to stay in power, these people turn state enterprises into their own private property, manipulate the electoral results, give oppositions as little room as possible, hamper free organisations, restrict the press and, if need be, use violence against their own people.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan is ready for radical change, but the initial impetus in this direction by demonstrators was nipped in the bud on 13 May, with brute force that claimed hundreds of lives. Ever since, the outside world has remained conspicuously silent. Might that have something to do with its economic and military interests? Is the dictatorship in Uzbekistan to be allowed to stay on because it proved itself useful in the military intervention in Afghanistan? Are we leaving its inhabitants in the lurch? Europe must not make their rights and freedoms secondary to other considerations. The draft resolution helps us to adopt the necessary position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transformations we witnessed in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, during which systems based on respect for human rights were established, did not initially take place in Ukraine. We are still awaiting such transformations in Belarus, and unfortunately there is no sign of them in Uzbekistan either.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 13 May 2005 were a measure of sorts of the current conditions in Uzbekistan. The attitude of the government, which refuses to allow foreign observers to investigate the causes of the many deaths, as well as intimidating journalists and preventing external monitoring, means that Parliament must take a firm stance on this issue. It is for this reason that we are calling for investigations to be carried out into all these issues, and for democracy to be established in Uzbekistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we have been discussing European colonialism in Africa, but in this instance the colonialism was Soviet and Communist in character, following on the heels of Tsarist colonialism in Central Asia. It was only in 1989, with the overthrow of the Communist regime in Central Europe, that this colonialism was brought to an end – something I would like to say for Mr Kohlíček’s benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are under the obligation to consider the situation there in a realistic light. These countries were punished by being turned into monocultures, they were plundered and bled dry, and now they have set out on the laborious road to statehood. One has to have a certain sympathy for their situation, and they also need all the intensive help we can offer. That does not mean, however, that we can turn a blind eye to human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">What we call for is clear and unambiguous: we demand that the Uzbek Government should cease from obstructing the investigations that are already overdue, that it should release all detainees and grant fundamental and human rights. If we are to make any headway here, though, it will be by dialogue and not by treating the other party as a child.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be aware of the presence of terrorists and destabilising elements throughout the region, not to mention the continuing influence of Moscow, which has recently been supplying Uzbekistan with large quantities of plate mines, which we have often had cause to discuss in this House, and which are intended, among other things, for the further fortification of the borders. Russian troops are still present, acting as if this were still colonial territory. That is something else that we cannot accept just like that, since this is a region in which the powers’ vital geo-strategic interests collide, not least in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">So let it be said loud and clear that, in this area, there are two opposites: human rights and open and fair partnership on the one hand, and colonialism in whatever shape or form on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Precisely how many people lost their lives on those May days in Andijan is something that the global public has until now been unable to find out. Human rights organisations’ figures vary between 500 and 1 000, while the Uzbek Government gives the number of victims as 176. Over and over again, President Karimov uses Islamism as a blunt instrument with which to put his political opponents – of whatever stripe – out of action. That is why it is vital that we should press home our demands for the setting at liberty of those human rights activists, journalists and members of the political opposition who are still in prison. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, Uzbekistan is enjoying the closest possible cooperation from an EU Member State. That Member State is Germany, which, in Termes, is operating a military base of crucial geopolitical importance, particularly in terms of military operations in Afghanistan. I am told by NATO that it is not one of their bases, even though it is used by NATO states, and also by the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Greece and Spain – all of them EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany is granting Uzbekistan extensive economic and military aid, said to amount to EUR 2 billion, along with weapons factories, old weapons and so on. The EU’s human rights policy is hypocritical if, on the one hand, the brutal human rights violations come in for justified criticism, while, on the other, geopolitical considerations mean that the regime in Uzbekistan receives military and economic aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Uzbekistan is a former Soviet republic, yet although it has achieved partial independence from the Communist regime, power continues to be exercised in the same way. Islam Karimov, the former Communist First Secretary who holds the position of president, has proved himself to be a dictator. He is attempting to placate the rival powers of Russia, Europe and the United States, with the latter having used military bases in the country until recently. Uzbekistan is a region of strategic political and economic importance for both Russia and the United States, which makes the situation in the republic even more complex. Since 2001, the country has been one of the USA’s key allies in the fight against terrorism in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Russia, Uzbekistan is also a member of the Shanghai Five, a forum aimed at combating terrorism in Asia. Moscow uses the threat of Islamic fundamentalism as a means of scaring Uzbekistan into remaining within its sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan is a country with abundant natural resources, including oil and gas. Mainly due to US aid, it has chalked up a certain amount of economic success. It is also a country where ethnically diverse populations of Islamic, Orthodox and Catholic faith previously lived together peacefully. In recent times, however, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> as a result of clashes between foreign pressures and Karimov’s authoritarian practices, the country has been witness to human rights violations and persecution of the opposition, in particular the Islamic opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 May, a demonstration in Andijan was violently suppressed, and it is thought that several hundred civilians may have died. In spite of protests, the perpetrators of the massacre have not been brought to justice, and the press has passed over the tragedy in silence. Reports from foreign observers, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch talk of unprecedented and barbaric torture perpetrated in Uzbek prisons against the regime’s opponents, of human rights violations and of the persecution of the independent journalists and political activists who uncovered the truth about the events of 13 May. Following a number of unsuccessful attempts on his life, President Karimov now refers to Muslim critics as fanatics and terrorists, in so doing justifying the persecution of independent political thinkers in the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Holy Father, John Paul II, reminded us that freedom is always a challenge. He also said that power is a challenge to freedom, and that it can only be wielded by serving others. The international community and those in positions of power should always give human dignity and human rights precedence over economic interests. It is for this reason that we are calling for an end to persecution, respect for human dignity and compliance with the basic obligations arising from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and democratic principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The package of restrictive measures includes the partial suspension of the partnership and cooperation agreement, an arms embargo, a selective visa ban as well as consideration of actions in the framework of the United Nations and the OSCE. That is a very clear and strong political signal by the Union to Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the Member States on the imposition of the visa ban, the arrangements for the implementation of which are currently being finalised. The Commission equally fully supports the implementation of the arms embargo and has prepared the legislation for the Council to be effective immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), the Commission has immediately suspended all further technical meetings with Uzbekistan. That means that we have suspended the Subcommittees on Trade and Investment and on Justice, Liberty and Security, along with the Cooperation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the initiative for the Cooperation Council meeting rests with the Member States, the Commission takes the view that the meeting could be maintained in order not to sever our political dialogue with Uzbekistan altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note of the decision to postpone the Sixth EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting and regrets that the delegation would not be allowed to travel to the Andijan region nor to have unrestricted access to members of the opposition, non-governmental organisations and the independent media.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to Community assistance, the Commission has agreed to a reduction and reorientation of EU assistance from EUR 11 million to EUR 9.25 million in this year, and from EUR 9 million to EUR 7.25 million next year. In spite of those cuts, we strongly believe that targeted EU assistance should continue. It should focus on poverty reduction in the Ferghana valley and the development of a civil society, as well as on legal and judicial reforms and on the development of higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to stress that the human rights situation which existed before the events in May was already very bleak and a source of deep concern to the Commission. To name but one of our concerns, the Commission would very much welcome a public commitment in support of President Karimov's condemnation of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission will continue to press the Uzbeks to establish an immediate moratorium on all death sentences before the abolition of the death penalty in 2008. The Commission is also concerned about reports of the detention and harassment of people including human rights defenders, journalists and local activists who have questioned the authorities' version of events.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its efforts in the fight against drug trafficking, improving border management, energy networks and transport networks. The exclusion of Uzbekistan from such regional programmes would damage Uzbekistan's neighbours more than Uzbekistan itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
