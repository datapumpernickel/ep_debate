<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Member for her report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea. The funding proposed by this regulation will be an essential part of the fisheries financial perspectives package for 2007-2013. Next to the European Fisheries Fund, this regulation represents the legal basis for most other expenditure allowing the continuation of the common fisheries policy and, based on the Commission’s original proposal for a financial perspective, it will cover more than EUR 2.5 billion worth of spending in the seven year period from 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal aims to provide a more transparent and simplified framework for the execution of Community financial interventions. It is geared towards improving the effectiveness of financial interventions in the field of control and enforcement, in the area of data collection and scientific advice, in the strengthening of the governance of the common fisheries policy, and in the area of international relations and the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the amendments proposed in the report before us. The Commission can accept Amendment 1 and will continue to do what is possible within its competence to work towards ensuring the sustainability of the resources in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 2, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment. The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the crucial aspect of control capacities of third counties. Furthermore, the Commission plans to concentrate on developing common objectives with third countries, rather than prescribing to them detailed means as to how to get to those objectives as different countries have different needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 3 to 8 should be considered together with Amendment 17, since they quote objectives which were already covered in the Council’s conclusions of 19 July 2004, regarding fisheries partnership agreements. However, the legal provisions of this regulation are not the right place for policy statements. The Commission therefore considers that a reference to these conclusions in the recitals of the proposed regulation, as proposed by Amendment 17, is the most appropriate way to include these aspects and can therefore accept Amendment 17. As a consequence, the scope of Amendments 3 to 8 will be covered through this recital.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Natura 2000 network falls under the Community’s environmental policy, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 9 in a regulation which exclusively concerns the common fisheries policy. The Commission will, however, ensure coherence of the common fisheries policy with environmental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 10. In the framework of fisheries partnership agreements, the Council conclusions referred to earlier require coherence between the objectives of the CFP and the objectives of other Community policies such as environmental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appreciates the support the Committee on Fisheries has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate towards the regional advisory councils. The proposed Amendment 11 clearly sets out the desire of the Committee to see the role of the regional advisory councils facilitated through indefinite funding. Whereas the Commission is willing to explore options for funding beyond the currently prescribed five-year period, a commitment cannot be made at this stage since this would not be in line with the current regulation that has established the regional advisory councils, but this request can be reconsidered in the first evaluation of the functioning of the regional advisory councils three years after their establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the cost of commissioning scientific advice, the Commission is already paying independent and credible bodies to deliver the scientific advice. RACs are welcome to highlight to the Commission any need for scientific advice. However, the Commission reserves its right to decide on the justification of such a request on a case-by-case basis and will lead the process of obtaining this advice.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 12, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment. The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the objectives for fisheries partnership agreements. Value for money is just one of the principles mentioned in the Council conclusions of 19 July 2004 regarding fisheries partnership agreements, and it should not be highlighted individually to the detriment of the other principles and objectives defined in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 13. Most of the aspects mentioned in the amendment are covered either by the Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements, or by the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 14, but not on the form. In principle, the Commission agrees to provide summaries and aggregations of the collected data on request or for specific needs, but it is not planned at this point automatically to issue this data in the form of a periodic publication or report.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 15 cannot be accepted by the Commission, as fisheries partnership agreements are in essence based on a commercial relationship. The third country is responsible for and sovereign to spend its revenue under the agreement, in whole or in part, in support of its fisheries policy for the purposes jointly agreed in a common approach with the Community. The parties will jointly review the results obtained by this policy. However, in this context, the Commission cannot impose financial audits or on-the-spot checks on third countries without their agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 16. Each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds, as well as on the use of the share of these funds foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country. On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and, where appropriate, will make the necessary adjustments. As regards its national budget and financial administration, however, the third country is sovereign.</p>
<p class="contents">As said before, the Commission can accept Amendment 17.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment 18, the Commission welcomes the support from Parliament to reinforce the budget for the common fisheries policy in the course of the negotiations on the 2007–2013 financial perspective. The proposed regulation, by definition, can be adopted only once the financial perspective has, hopefully, been agreed. Therefore, adding a recital, as proposed in this amendment, is probably obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 19, but not on the form. Small-scale fisheries, as part of the catching sector, are already included as RAC members by virtue of the RAC decision. Thus the Commission already promotes their participation in RACs as full members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Stihler (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I should like to thank all colleagues for their support so far for my report. This report replaces a number of existing legal measures which provide the basis for current funding beyond monies provided by the European Fisheries Fund. This is in line with the policy of achieving better regulation and simplification of legislation. It sets out objectives for: expenditure, rules for eligibility of expenditure, the level of the Commission contribution and control measures. The key areas covered are: control and enforcement, data collection, scientific advice, governance of the CFP and international matters. The total budget foreseen for 2007-2013 is EUR 2 625 million, although the actual amounts, as the Commissioner has said, will depend on the EU budget negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">On control and enforcement, the aim is to improve the control of fishing activities in order to combat those fishing activities that are damaging the conservation of resources within and outside Community waters. This is to be achieved by providing Community financial support to Member States to reduce weaknesses in their fisheries control programmes and by assisting coordination of control measures, particularly via the Community Fisheries Control Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the area of data collection and scientific advice, Community support will allow for the collection and management of the data needed to evaluate the state of fisheries resources and the fishing industry within and outside Community waters. This will assist the Member States to establish multiannual, aggregated and science-based data sets which incorporate biological, environmental and economic information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of governance, the goal is to ensure the involvement of stakeholders at all stages of policy development up to and including implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of international relations and the law of the sea, Community financial support is given for the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries, including partnership agreements, and participation in international organisations relating to fisheries or the law of the sea. This area is allocated the lion’s share of the budget – EUR 1 592.5 million, of which EUR 1 522.5 million will go to fisheries agreements. In addition, some money has been allocated to technical and administrative assistance, including related staff costs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although the sums allocated by the Commission have been increased in committee, MEPs expressed concern that the allocation would not cover all the tasks required. These have been increased by enlargement and the need to collect data on the new seas – for example, current data on the Black Sea scarcely exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Uncertainty over funding – not least as we await a new EU budget – poses the question of whether more funds can be made available, and if so, how they should be allocated. If more funding is not available, then the question of whether funding is appropriately allocated by this proposal arises.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of RACs is a vital and most welcome development. They will play a key role in the management of the CFP. However, we need to ensure that the RAC areas are adequately supported. They are unlikely to generate sufficient resources of their own after the start-up phase and, indeed, the operating costs are certain to increase after the start-up phase, as the RACs and their working groups – the North Sea RAC already has four of them – progressively generate and implement new projects in support of management guidance to the Commission. Even in the start-up phase, the level of support to the RACs from the Commission diminishes progressively and steeply and continues to do so, year on year, as the RAC itself is expected to become increasingly self-supporting. Moreover, the secretariats of the RACs have only limited capacity to seek alternative sources of funding, notably from Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only limited opportunity – or justification – to pass the burden of cost on to the stakeholders – members of the general assembly and executive committees – especially as individual stakeholders – such as NGOs – seek to be involved in several RACs simultaneously, which incurs significant resource costs. It is vital to press for finance to be available for RACs beyond the initial five-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial support for the collection of data on the impact of fisheries on the environment in relation to adopting an ecosystem-based approach is also important. Almost 60% of all the money goes on international fishing agreements, and it is only right that we make sure this amounts to value for money and is a fair development.</p>
<p class="contents">Expenditure on agreements should be eligible for Community financing only if it has been recommended as value for money under an evaluation report on the relevant agreement. It is also important to develop control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing monitoring and control of fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">If cuts need to be made in the Commission’s indicative budget, savings should be found from the international relations area, the largest budget area.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank colleagues for their support and urge them to support this report tomorrow, and I wish everybody a Happy Christmas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we do not agree with the rapporteur’s statement that, in the event of a reduction of the appropriations laid down in the Commission’s proposal, they should be taken without any justification whatsoever from the heading corresponding to fisheries agreements, despite the fact that the rapporteur appears to have forgotten that the majority of these funds are now intended to meet the costs of development aid, and not the commercial part of those agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the usual cliché of linking the funding of fisheries agreements to prior cost-benefit analyses is not practical at this stage. Firstly, the <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> and <span class="italic">ex-post</span> studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and, at the same time, due to their new status as association agreements, we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, neither do we agree that Natura 2000 network measures should be funded by means of CFP funds. In this regard, I would refer to what this Parliament said in the Böge report on the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and with regard to the regional fisheries committees, I do not believe that there is any justification, for the moment at least, for extending the period for their funding laid down in Community legislation, particularly when the majority of the RACs are not yet operating, since less than half of those planned have been set up. The logical thing is for the RAC to be an instrument that will eventually be self-funding, if it is as useful as we hope, and not to become an additional burden for contributors, particularly within a policy for which the financial contribution is always below the minimums. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know why it is precisely the common policy with the least funds that is most besieged by requests of all kinds. In this regard, although I am genuinely grateful for the work of the rapporteur ― as she knows ― I feel obliged to make a series of comments, or rather discrepancies, in relation to the text that has been approved in committee and on which we are going to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring specifically to Amendments 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13, on which I shall comment briefly. Within the context of this Regulation, and aware of the beneficial consequences of international agreements in the Community’s regions in terms of employment, I understand the Commission’s position on this issue. Maintaining employment is a specific objective that nobody questions. To set this objective without specifically mentioning the Community, as Mrs Stihler does, could be a mistake. It is a laudable desire, but it does not fall within the scope of the CFP and furthermore it does not seem to me to be a realistic objective.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to data collection for Natura 2000, proposed in Amendment 9, I believe that it should be financed by means of funds intended for the environment policy ― as I have always said ― and not by means of the CFP. Those of us who deal with the CFP know that through this policy we are paying for other obligations laid down within other Community policies, as demonstrated by the increasing economic weight of development cooperation within the fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when, in Amendment 12, Mrs Stihler proposes the criterion of providing value for money as a determining factor in fisheries agreements, I feel obliged to ask what kind of value for money she is referring to. Value for money for the third country? Furthermore, Mrs Stihler, I believe that, if we work on the basis of this criterion of value for money, I do not know whether we will be able to implement the cooperation policy to which I have just referred, and to which you yourself refer. I genuinely do not know whether or not you, as rapporteur, have given this criterion of value for money, which I find so difficult to understand, sufficient thought.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept the two amendments presented by Mr Guerreiro, as well as Amendment 17, presented by Mrs Stihler. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These largely related to the issue of international fisheries agreements. I have to say, Commissioner, I was rather disappointed by your response to them.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not deny the importance of these agreements, but we believe that if we are expending European taxpayers’ money, whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights, we should know exactly how this money is being expended. Amendment 16 in particular was crafted very carefully to get over the international legal difficulties in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about fisheries partnership agreements with obligations on both sides. If we do not have this information, if we cannot evaluate what is going on, how can we decide whether we should renew them when the time comes? There are serious concerns about what is going on in some third-country waters. Only last week, the Environmental Justice Foundation published a report on illegal fishing in Guinea and its links to the European Union. A telling statistic cited in the report is that Guinea is losing over 34 000 tonnes of fish every year to illegal fishing, worth an estimated USD 110 million. The EU fleet is only one of several implicated in this, but it is implicated all the same.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this one example demonstrates why it is crucial that care is taken with regard to the EU’s fishing agreements, ensuring that the Union is helping to improve governance in third-country waters, but also addressing the urgent need on all sides to step up the quality of monitoring and enforcement. Several of the amendments in this report would help the Union move towards more responsible fishing agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">On a slightly different topic, the ALDE Group welcomes Amendment 11 proposing that funding for the operating costs of regional advisory councils should not be restricted to the first five years. As the Commissioner has said, they are the cornerstone of the governance of the revised common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The funding provided for in the Commission’s proposal will not enable us to achieve the objectives set out in this regulation, such as the financing of control and enforcement measures, conservation measures, data collection and improvement of scientific advice, governance, international relations and the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial resources for this important common fisheries policy instrument must be increased, in light of the enlargement of the EU and the more ambitious objectives that have been set out. Yet no such increase is forthcoming. The British Presidency’s proposal is just another in the series of cuts being made to the 2007-2013 Community budget. Accordingly, we have tabled a proposal for an amendment stating that the global financial envelope for fisheries, and specifically for this proposal for a regulation, is woefully inadequate if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector and to meet the needs arising from the 2002 review of the common fisheries policy, and proposing adequate financial resources for the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, given that, in our view, it is of key importance that fishermen be involved in setting out and implementing the common fisheries policy at every level, we have also tabled a proposal that support should be provided for setting up or promoting representative associations of small coastal fishing, far and away the most important part of the sector, and that such fishermen be involved in decision-making processes in regional advisory councils.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to say that the regulation continues to be guided by the idea that the sole factor in conserving fisheries resources is to reduce fishing activities at EU level, disregarding other determining factors.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the primary objective should be to promote sustainable modernisation and development in the sector. It is also essential that the balance of fisheries resources be maintained so as to guarantee that fish supplies to the public are not interrupted, jobs are not lost and fishermen’s living and working conditions are improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A UK minister in the late 1940s once remarked that Britain’s economy was safe for years to come because, he said, we live on an island of coal, surrounded by fish. The coal is still there, if we care to use it, but the fish have almost gone, due to the disaster that is common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Designed to conserve fish stocks, this misbegotten scheme has reduced some species to near extinction. Among the most depleted are the plentiful stocks once found in the North Sea and Irish Box, up until 1973 the exclusive province of British fishermen who looked after the fishing grounds and reaped a rich harvest. Then we joined the common market and the CFP, and now these seas are a marine desert in the making, if not already so.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair shares for all under the CFP, do I hear? If so, why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further afield? And what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out? Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry. Just so. Under the CFP vast fleets of trawlers from countries previously excluded are rapaciously fishing these grounds to extinction, while fertiliser factory ships vacuum up vast quantities of marine life on the seabed, destroying the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">How could any sane person devise the CFP scheme of quotas resulting in fish caught in excess being thrown back? Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back? Do you not know that for some species the annual weight of useless discards is as much as the weight of the fish legally landed? Compare that to Norway and Iceland who both refused to join the EU: their fish stocks remain plentiful and their fishing industries flourish because they look after them, forbidding discards. Meanwhile, the British fishing fleet has sunk to less than a quarter of its previous size.</p>
<p class="contents">Destruction of the fishing industry means that the fishermen are out of work and on benefit. It means that fishing ports are in terminal decline, so structural funds are poured in. It means that the social and economic fabric around the ports declines, while the EU claims to be combating this particular misery.</p>
<p class="contents">If you think this is a purely British complaint, think again. The fishing industry is a factor in the UK’s GDP to which contributions to the EU budget are geared, and that comes on top of the destruction of a priceless natural resource. And so, another Christmas goose reduces its output of golden eggs! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU must now focus on how to manage and distribute its budget accordingly. In order to pursue a sound, sensitive and sustainable strategy, we need to have tools at our disposal allowing us to take appropriate action, in line with what I believe were the wishes of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a regulation establishes a framework of measures for the purposes of implementing the common fisheries policy, complementing the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), which we debated in the Chamber some months ago. As I said of the EFF at the time, it is crucial that the funds earmarked for these regulations be consistent with the actual needs of an integrated fisheries sector within an enlarged Europe facing fresh challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I welcome the Commission’s efforts to make the financial agreements under the common fisheries policy (CFP) clearer and more coherent, I must express my displeasure at the mismatch between the professed objectives and the funds set aside. Given that objectives following the EU’s enlargement need to be more ambitious and farther-reaching, I feel that it is inappropriate to impose a 6.3% cut on this financial instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the fact that 60% of the budget of EUR 2 625 million, spread across four main operational objectives, has been set aside for international fisheries agreements. The strand relating to partnership agreements on fisheries is vitally important on account of its prominence in the budget. This report maintains the consistency between the conclusions of the recent Fisheries and Agriculture Councils regarding the new CFP and the EU’s international relations, and this strikes me as being of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the setting up and maintaining of regional advisory councils (RACs) are key to the new CFP. It is therefore vital to ensure not only that funding is available to cover the start-up costs of the RACs, but also that the councils remain viable. To this end, the Commission must clarify more clearly to what extent all areas relating to the RACs are to be funded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fishing contributes to improving quality of life at European level and to protecting the coastline and the environment. In many cases, small-scale fishing even helps to bolster tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising that the fishing community plays an important role. The job they do with such passion is demanding, tough and dangerous and their income is dependent on too many uncertainties. Often in debt, and subject to the continually rising price of diesel, fishermen and their families live with the fear of not being able to make ends meet and of losing their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout its existence, the common fisheries policy has failed to relieve their fears. On the contrary, it has contributed to the loss of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs and to the social insecurity of fishermen, without achieving convincing results with respect to the conservation of resources. What is worse, this policy has often given the impression of being subject to the law of the lobbies, who are more interested in cultivating their media images and in chasing subsidies than in making a serious effort to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is why fishermen are fed up with continually being suspected of being the criminals of the sea, by a European Commission that, in contrast, is far too lenient on the real pirates of the sea, by which I mean flags of convenience. Commissioner, contrary to the prejudices of your learned assembly of scientists, nobody is more committed to conserving fishery resources than fishermen. It is their livelihood, their heritage and the future of their children. They have had more than enough of a situation in which quotas for fishing days and catch sizes, often laid down without a real scientific basis and traded any old how between the States, are involved in establishing fishing zones. The Commission must not continue to favour fishermen of one nationality over those of another. Everyone must be on an equal footing within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that your text represents a certain amount of progress in the field, in setting as one of its formal objectives the involvement of all stakeholders, but you will forgive me for describing it as vague and timid. We cannot save fishing and fishery resources without the fishermen and their professional associations and trade unions. Fishermen, through their representatives, must be truly involved in all decisions affecting them. The Union must also provide financial aid to the Member States to help them protect their territorial waters against illegal fishing. I am thinking in particular of the territorial waters of the outermost regions of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as there is a real problem of funding a fair, sustainable and bold European fisheries policy, we must not forget that one of the threats to resources comes from pollution caused by maritime transport. The system of flags of convenience is behind this pollution. If, therefore, we can point the finger at those responsible for this ongoing ecological disaster, we will be in a position to launch a really ambitious policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is due to a number of reasons: enlargement, new technologies, broader scope of data, the new control agencies and the establishment of the regional advisory councils. On the latter point, I wish to say, as I said before, that the Commission is willing to consider the funding of the regional advisory councils during the review to be undertaken after the third year of their operation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the extent of the funds, were more funds to be made available the Commission would surely not complain. However, in reality we will hopefully have a 150% increase in control and enforcement, a 160% increase in data collection and scientific advice, a 110% increase in governance and a 120% increase in international relations. If all goes well, there will be an overall increase of 130% if one compares the 2000-2006 financial period and the 2007-2013 financial period.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a reduction, we have a cushion to some extent, so we do not have to deduct from any one specific heading. If there is going to be a drastic cut, all headings will be affected linearly. We will know hopefully before the end of the week what the situation is going to be. So far, from the indications we have, the cuts envisaged under the financial perspective as regards fisheries are relatively small, especially in the second instrument, and hopefully it will stay that way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the international agreements, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes the balance between internal and external policies, between international agreements and conservation, control and governance. At this juncture I wish to highlight that the allocations to the various areas are only indicative and based on current forecasts. Adjustments for each programme will in any case be submitted and adopted every year in the annual budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on the point made by Mrs Attwooll with regard to Amendment 16. Since these are commercial relationships, the monies often go directly to the treasury budget as part of the budget of the state. However, we intend to strengthen our dialogue with the Commission’s development services, to enhance the effectiveness of these monies in these countries’ general development objectives, in particular in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">With particular reference to the fisheries partnership agreements, I need to underline that each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds under the agreement, as well as on the use of the financial share foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country. On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, as I have said before, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and where appropriate will make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the remarks made by Mr Clark, I cannot agree with his assertions. The lower stocks of fish are the result of year upon year of uncontrolled over-fishing and not of the common fisheries policy. That policy, through its measures, seeks to address the need for balance between the availability of stocks and the fleets that target them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the point on coastal fisheries and small-scale fisheries is better addressed under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted early in 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
