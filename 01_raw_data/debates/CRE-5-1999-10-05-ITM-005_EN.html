What are they about? The Commission proposes granting loans to help the balance of payments in the context of a macro-economic stabilisation programme drawn up by the International Monetary Fund. It is intended to grant a sum of EUR 100 million to Bulgaria and a sum of EUR 200 million to Romania, in each case as a long-term loan. In the case of Macedonia, a contribution of no more than EUR 30 million in addition to the euro loan of EUR 50 million has been proposed because the country’s financial position has been particularly exacerbated by the conflict in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of all the countries, the financial assistance is to be provided in two tranches with the second tranche only being released once economic development and reforms have been satisfactorily resumed. </p>
<p class="contents">The amounts I have mentioned for the various States are proportionate, on the one hand, to the estimated deficits in the balance of payments of the individual countries and, on the other hand, to the multilaterally agreed share which the EU has to contribute to these forms of macro-economic financial assistance. We are therefore concerned here with comparatively modest amounts. Just to support the balance of payments of the six States bordering Kosovo, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have estimated that USD 1.5 billion in financing is required. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly go into details about the three countries which we are now dealing with here. For Macedonia, an external financial shortfall to the tune of USD 372 million is expected in 1999. Financial assistance is therefore an urgent matter in view of the vital interests which Europe has in stability in the Balkans. The dramatic reports may have disappeared from the television screens, but there are still thousands of Kosovan refugees in Macedonia. </p>
<p class="contents">With the economic development since the change of government in 1997, Bulgaria has made some remarkable progress. Economic growth has been stimulated again. The rate of inflation has fallen. Exports have increased and direct foreign investments have been noted. However, the balance of payments deteriorated in 1998, with the crisis in Russia being partly responsible for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bulgaria’s balance of payments for 1999, a financial shortfall of approximately USD 500 million is anticipated. Without the balance of payments loan of a maximum of EUR 100 million proposed by the Commission, the Bulgarian reform programme might be placed in jeopardy. Aid from the EU might also make it easier for Bulgaria to make some progress with safety at its nuclear power plants. This is also a matter of some concern for my home country, Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the conflict in Kosovo, foreign trade has further deteriorated in Romania. An additional balance of payments deficit amounting to USD 190 million is in the offing. Here too, the laborious process of economic reform must be continued with and supported. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to make further progress, Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia need our help. The planned financial aid which, in the first place, is really a technical process, is also politically significant in connection with the discussion about enlargement of the European Union and, above all, against the background of the destabilisation of South-East Europe because of the Kosovo conflict. My own homeland, Austria, borders on four countries which want to join the European Union. It, therefore, has a particular interest in the economic and also political stabilisation of Central and South-East Europe. Such stabilisation cannot be achieved unless the region makes its own contribution. How much would growing uncertainty in Central and Eastern Europe cost in terms of political and financial capital? In the end, how much would it cost us to look on and do nothing? We must therefore commit ourselves, and not only financially but also politically.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists last week lent its support in Skopje to the idea of a Stability Pact in South-East Europe and, above all, took up the themes of democracy, human rights and a civilian society. Strengthening civilian society is undoubtedly an important concern but is inconceivable without stable framework conditions for the various national economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend approval of the Commission’s proposals for financial assistance, including the amendments included in the report. My amendments to the Commission’s document are a reminder of the goal of macro-economic stabilisation. What, however, we must be concerned with, above all, is securing long-term employment and improving the conditions of people’s lives in the countries affected. In this context, the IMF’s policy of economic restructuring is often cause for fierce and necessary criticism. In the end, programmes in South-East Asia and particularly in Indonesia were to the detriment of poor strata of the population when, for example, subsidies for basic foodstuffs were cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the economic reforms which are on the agenda in the former socialist States, a situation must therefore be prevented in which the burdens of change again affect those in society who are least able to defend themselves. It is true that the IMF has improved in many respects, but there is still a great deal of work to be done. Accordingly, we are also arguing for having representatives of the programmes join us here in Parliament, or at least in the Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">With my changes, I should also like, however, to go on emphasising that the Commission and the relevant States are obliged to comply with the rules for budget supervision and efficient administration. It must go without saying that the European Parliament will be informed appropriately and in good time about any payments made and about the ways in which these are used. Finally, steps must be taken to ensure that the macro-economic financial assistance is not misappropriated, as we have seen happen in a dramatic way in Russia. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has requested urgent procedure in connection with the financial aid to these three countries. This means that we must approve them this week here in Strasbourg. In commenting upon this, the Committee on Budgets pointed out the basic interinstitutional problems and problems relating to budget policy which would arise if we were to comply with the Council’s request for urgent procedure in the case of financial assistance for Macedonia, since in this case, the Commission’s proposal contains a subsidy component.</p>
<p class="contents">Granting up to EUR 30 million in subsidies to Macedonia throws up budgetary problems of a technical nature. The funds specified in Category 4, “External Actions”, of the Financial Perspective have already been exhausted by the funds assigned in the draft EU budget. The European Parliament must therefore insist upon a corresponding review of the Financial Perspective as a prior condition for granting the subsidy. Overall, there ought, however, to be agreement about the fact that aid is quickly needed for Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are concerned with is macro-economic financial assistance for those countries. That means that the European Union only acts as an intermediary in obtaining funds. The money is borrowed on the international markets and passed on to these countries for their use. The European Union can guarantee that the cost of borrowing is less than it would be if these countries borrowed the funds directly from the international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid to be given to Macedonia is the most problematic of these financings, because in this instance it is not only a case of a loan, but also of a grant, to be paid over two years. The Council has decided on this form of financing, but it made the decision without the corresponding funds being available. The Committee on Budgets draws its attention to this fact. If the Financial Perspective is not revised, we will have to adjust other budget lines under heading 4, “External Action”, and in order to secure the aid to Macedonia, we will find ourselves cutting aid to other areas. With this kind of financial aid, it cannot be the intention that, in order for one country to receive, money should be taken away from others. For this reason, the Committee on Budgets has proposed to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that it should demand a revision of the Financial Perspective in this regard, and positive reference has been made to this in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Examination of the Financial Perspective is, in any case, an important matter and is linked in its entirety to the question of what the financial basis is or, in other words, to the fact that the war in Kosovo has brought about a situation which is unexpected and new and which had not been catered for by the Financial Perspective. This is also linked directly to an examination of the Financial Perspective, which must be carried out on account of the aid to Kosovo, the funds to rebuild areas of Turkey devastated by the recent earthquakes and on account of the agreement on fishing with Morocco. Neither is it unconnected with the fact that at this moment in time there are not sufficient funds available to realise all those projects in Category 4 which the Council and the Commission want to realise and which they have proposed. The response of Parliament to the form proposed by the Committee on Budgets is that it is important in connection with this issue to examine the Financial Perspective and in this way also to ensure that general aid from Parliament and from the European Union really does reach its destination and also to safeguard the possibility of bringing these matters to a favourable conclusion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say that he has presented a well-balanced set of reports with particular sensitivity. Not only do I believe this, but our Committee also displayed this by adopting the amendments and text with a majority vote.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s granting of financial assistance concerns three countries: FYROM, Bulgaria and Romania. We should once again clarify that we are talking about financial assistance of a macro-economic nature. In other words, on the one hand, it anticipates a viable balance of payments for those countries and, on the other hand, it facilitates the implementation of structural reforms which are necessary for all three countries if we want to see them face a future brighter than the past. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that in addition to the EUR 50 million loan for FYROM, there is also the non-returnable grant, a financial boost in the region of EUR 30 million. The reason behind this is that this country has been worst affected and has welcomed many refugees as a result of the atrocities in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards Bulgaria, EUR 100 million have been granted by way of loan solely in order to support the balance of payments and facilitate the structural changes and reforms which are scheduled. The same goes for Romania, for whom a loan in the region of EUR 200 million is envisaged. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the aid will not be given arbitrarily but will be monitored by the Commission with the cooperation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, of course, with the coordination of the International Monetary Fund. I believe, and those of us who support these reports believe, that those monies will be put to good use, as it is clear that those countries are venturing in the right direction. Of course, what we must realise and understand, and what we should be particularly mindful of, is the fact that those countries set off from a different starting-point to us. If we consider the fact that they have less than ten years’ experience of functioning within the private economy, within the free market and with free competition, whereas we were born into, we have grown up with and we have been shaped by the framework of a free economy, then we will understand just what these countries are up against. That is why I am certain that the aid they receive will prove to be beneficial. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, I would like to say that the sooner they are given this financial assistance, the sooner they can grow and develop in the best possible way. There are no time limits. They are waiting their turn. They found themselves to be victims of a war they did not start and in which they did not participate except for acting as host countries to the negative after-effects. We have a moral duty and, indeed, we are in a position to give them this material support. At the same time, however, we must, of course, tackle the economic repercussions of all this, and there are other problems here which need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am making an appeal, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am calling on everybody to vote in favour of these three reports. They are a move in the right direction; they express the sentiments of the European Union; they express the sentiments of this European Parliament.<span class="bold"> </span>I would like to ask that we all contribute towards increasing those resources<span class="bold">, </span>within the fiscal limitations – and we need to make some fiscal amendments to certain articles – so that we not only show our good intentions but that we turn them into deed in the best and most effective way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I say necessary because these countries are trying to adjust to a new environment of economic and commercial relations which are causing them problems, particularly in their balance of payments which, in turn, is affecting the general functioning of the market and economic development. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this aid is urgent – and I would say particularly urgent – because following the bombings in Yugoslavia, the whole economic equilibrium of the region was dangerously affected with exceptionally negative repercussions on those countries which fell victim to the intervention, without their wanting or causing it. Therefore, this macro-financial assistance is both necessary and urgent and our Parliament must show its support by promoting these Southern European countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point which will sway decisions to<span class="bold"> </span>vote in favour of the Council’s proposal is that the level of financial assistance is relatively low and so it will not affect the economic programme of the Commission. As for the difficulty which was mentioned regarding Category 4 of the Budget for FYROM, it is absurd to insist on this aid and not come up with the EUR 30 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, this aid is necessary, urgent and imperative and yet our contribution is minor compared to the great efforts that these countries are displaying in their adjusting to the new challenges they are facing and which the war has tragically exacerbated. I believe this aid merits our unanimous support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each of you will be thinking, are there still questions about this issue? Support for lasting, successful development in the countries concerned is, however, urgently necessary. Here, I wish to clearly state again on behalf of my group, that we want to do everything to ensure that Bulgaria and Romania are not left behind in the process of enlarging the European Union. These countries, and also the neighbouring country of Macedonia, urgently need our political and economic support. In this connection, I should again like to remind you that this Parliament has decided here on several occasions that the visa requirement for entering and leaving Romania and Bulgaria, which constitutes a form of exclusion, should finally be removed. The Council and the Commission should urgently state their position on this issue at the Helsinki Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of financial assistance, the Commission and the Council always extol their splendid charitable initiatives in referring to the huge sums given by way of macro-economic aid. Have you ever asked, though, how effective this macro-economic assistance is in regard to economically and socially-balanced development in these crisis-racked countries? What basically is the money for? Whose pockets is it really going into? The truth is that not a single euro benefits the people in the region, neither small and medium-sized businesses nor the education and health systems. Nor is the money used to create employment. It does not contribute either to the local and regional infrastructure, the reconstruction of which is an important prerequisite for investment. No, it amounts to nothing more than bribes for international banking systems. It offsets the indebtedness into which the IMF has brought these countries. It flows practically direct into the coffers of the international banks and in that way contributes to the further indebtedness of the so-called recipient countries. It is also only a credit, even if the conditions are better than those of the EMF. Nonetheless, the conditions are: save on health care and on social insurance and pensions systems. The result: the further impoverishment of broad strata of the populations of the countries concerned. Is that what we mean by stability? Can stability in the region be based upon further indebtedness and further impoverishment? In practice, the macro-economic assistance only contributes to account being taken of the budgetary conditions of the EMF. The indebtedness is therefore compounded. In other words, we need a change of direction in the structure, and we need politics to again assume priority in this domain and responsibility for economic and socially-balanced development which is genuinely stable.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank the Members, firstly, for their analysis of the problem and, secondly, for their generally positive reaction to the proposal which is being examined here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like, in my first appearance before this Parliament, to insist once again on something that I insisted on in the Commission, which is the need to establish the best possible relationship between my duties as Commissioner and the people responsible for the corresponding areas in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the various interventions have shown that there is no group which, in principle, will stand in the way of aid. In fact I have noticed a position which is clearly favourable to the proposals. We all agree that the crisis in Kosovo, which has given rise to this difficulty, leaves us no choice but to make a greater effort. However, I would like to clarify certain issues which may help us to understand the Commission’s position with regard to the different proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are talking about balance of payments aid. Balance of payments aid is very different from the provision of funds for normal programmes. Balance of payments aid is aimed at boosting a country’s reserves in such a way that it can confront its external payments problems, which always have a compensation: it is always either the provision of services or the supply of goods which is being paid for. Therefore we are not talking about funds directed at the budgets of each one of these countries, the aim of which would be to carry out specific actions. Clearly, and as a consequence of this fact, they are connected neither to specific projects or programmes. We are talking about a financial contribution aimed at confronting these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the funds are connected to agreements with the International Monetary Fund which have this same objective. In the case of FYROM, the situation is rather different. That country is currently negotiating an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. It is possible that agreements will be reached, in which case we will cooperate with them, but, in the event that no agreement is reached, we believe that the situation demands the support of the European Union in any event. Therefore, whether or not there is an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, there will be support for FYROM, although it must clearly be conditional upon the application of the necessary reform programme so that these funds will be put to specific effective use.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that this is not the first time that this type of aid has been granted to these countries. It has happened in the past. This aid has always functioned efficiently. We have never had problems with regard to the repayment of debts, there have never been delays on the part of these countries, and therefore, from our point of view, and in financial terms, they are absolutely viable partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these preliminary comments, I would like to deal with the various proposals put forward by Mr Martin in his report. In view of the philosophy that I have explained, I believe that our position is understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first proposal, if I have understood correctly, the intention is something which I share completely with Mr Martin and that is that, ultimately, growth and economic reform should increase employment and improve standards of living. In these two respects, we are in absolute agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we would accept a wording which, in place of what has been put forward in the proposal, said “with a view to increasing employment and living standards.” This wording would be perfectly acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We come to the second point, which is the second Amendment, which intends to establish budgetary control by the Commission with regard to the funds in question. Given the difference between these funds and the normal projects which supply money to the budget, I am afraid that, in this case, this idea of budgetary control, which we all accept and defend, is not really applicable. In this case, the control must be carried out differently. We should control in general terms whether the country is using the funds correctly. Consequently, we would be in favour of an idea which seems to us fundamental, and that is that the Commission monitors the reforms which must be carried out in the said countries so that the aid may be used correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not believe that this point should be included in the text of the decision. The Commission is committed to carrying out this control and it should be done, obviously, in accordance with the evolution of macro-economic factors. We believe that this type of control will be sufficient. However, as I have said, we do not believe that including the proposed amendment is the best method.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 3, the fundamental idea, as has been said, is to try to ensure that a proportion of these resources is dedicated to the provision of the basic social needs of the population. This raises once again the problem that I mentioned before concerning the nature of this aid. If we were talking about budgetary aid I would have no hesitation whatsoever in accepting your proposal. In this case we are talking about financial support for these countries’ reserves in order to help them deal with a certain type of counterpart. We are not here to discuss whether or not we should support the basic needs of the population. Nevertheless, for your peace of mind, I will tell you that these cases are radically different from the case you have mentioned concerning Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">Also with regard to the International Monetary Fund’s own plan, in the Fund’s global plan concerning the definition of budgets and expenditure of the said countries, it is clearly established that a certain percentage of expenditure will have to be dedicated to social spending.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Romania for example – I have the figures here – at the moment, for 1997, 8.3% of GDP is being spent on social expenditure. However the condition established in the Fund’s plan states that in 1999, this figure should rise to 10.5% of GDP. Therefore, I hope that this addresses the Honourable Members’ concerns regarding the issues involving the International Monetary Fund. Nevertheless, I do not believe that it falls to the Commission to define internally, with regard to national budgets, how a global budget is to be established given that, as I said before, the Funds in question do not themselves have any particular specific purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">We could clearly say the same of Amendment No 4, which has a similar justification and problems of an analogous nature.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 3, however, I would like to make an additional point. There are specific Union programmes dedicated to this idea of improving administration and dealing with basic social needs. Please remember, for example, that in the PHARE programme, 30% of the resources are dedicated to “Institutional Building”, which is clearly linked to the whole question of improving administrative functioning which will allow the problems to be resolved. These are the reasons why Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 do not seem acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are in total agreement with Amendment No 5. To Amendment No 5, we would simply propose a small correction in terms of style and that is, instead of the phrase appearing after the reference to the International Monetary Fund, we believe it should appear immediately after the word “Commission”. Therefore it would be worded, “the Commission, in accordance with the principles of sound and efficient management, shall verify…”, etc. In this way we would totally accept your proposal but it would be more correctly worded.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 6, the Commission is asked to inform Parliament before carrying out the second payment of balance of payment appropriations. Again this raises a problem of form and practice. The problem is as follows: decisions of this type are based on elements which must be treated, I would not say as secrets, but at least, with a degree of confidentiality and that, therefore, it would not be appropriate, it seems to me, to explain them and discuss them in sessions which are absolutely public and on record. Therefore, the problem stems from how we will find a procedure which will inform Parliament of these facts before they happen without involving a public meeting which I believe could cause certain problems with regard to the handling of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The formula which I would now propose, and which I can commit myself to, is that, before these payments are made, the Chairmen of the Committees involved in these issues, for example, should be informed, so that Parliament has knowledge of them and there is no problem with regard to the need for confidentiality in relation to certain matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in total agreement with Amendment No 7 concerning the provision of information before a certain date.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we come to perhaps the most problematic amendment, in terms of the form it should take, which is the one concerning the additional loan of 30 million. The Honourable Members raise budgetary problems and, insofar as this is a contribution of a budgetary nature, they will have to be resolved. The resolution you propose involves a revision of the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to distinguish between the two time periods. Firstly 1999 and then 2000. We are talking about EUR 30 million – 15 for this year and 15 for next year. With regard to the 15 million for this year, I can tell you that the figures are laid out in the budget and therefore, we have no problem with meeting these payments immediately. The problem concerns next year and, in fact, in the Commission’s decision, if the Honourable Members would like to see page 7, in section 4 which refers to this issue, it clearly states that, given the existing budgetary restrictions, there could be some difficulty and an adjustment in Category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly not a new problem therefore. It is a problem that has been noted and you are right to raise it now. The difficulty is which solution to adopt. Should we adopt a specific solution consisting of revising, by means of a specific Council decision, the Financial Perspective with regard to a specific point? We believe that this would cause difficulty in terms of budgetary authority and analysing the issues individually, in such a way that we are not able to have a global view of the difficulties which we may have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would ask you not to include this reference to the revision of the Financial Perspective bearing in mind two things: firstly, that the Commission will clearly in any event consider revising the Financial Perspective in the future, taking into account not only this question but also other matters relating to Kosovo. Secondly, that logically it will fall to the budgetary authorities, to you as Parliament, to the Commission in its proposals and to the Council in its decisions, to take the decisions which it considers appropriate for 2000 without, at the moment, anticipating the definitive solution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
