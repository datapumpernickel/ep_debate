<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Parliament for offering me the opportunity to hold a debate on the disaster which has occurred off the French coast, as a result of the sinking of the oil tanker <span class="italic">Erika </span>on 12 December 1999, which resulted in more than 400 kilometres of coastline being contaminated with spilt oil, leading to the death of thousands of birds and other enormously adverse effects from the point of view of the environment and the preservation of our seas and of clean coastlines which meet the minimum requirements of a developed society. </p>
<p class="contents">In a way, the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> is the antithesis of what we have all been fighting for: sustainable development, development which is respectful of the environment. It is a clear violation of that approach to development and progress, a flagrant example of the way things should not be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I could expand on the specific facts which led to this accident. I will not do so. We all know them, and I simply want to say that the Commission shares the indignation, not only of those who live along the French coastline, who are the first to be affected by this disaster, but also all those Europeans – and non-Europeans – who may face similar disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission immediately expressed its solidarity and has wanted to contribute to combating the tragic consequences of this event with all the means at its disposal. But, in my opinion, it is not sufficient simply to combat these consequences. We should also seek solutions and proposals which will give the best possible assurance that events such as this do not recur.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, from the environmental point of view, I must say that, in collaboration with, and at the request of, the French authorities, immediately after the sinking, Commissioner Wallström, who is in charge of the environment, created an environmental crisis unit. This unit set up the Community “Marine Pollution” Working Group and offered the French authorities the best European experts in the combating of pollution. The Commission also participated in the deployment of tools for combating pollution in the area of the disaster, coordinating the actions of eleven Member States of the Union, who have sent more than 26 kilometres of floating barriers to the area. We believe that this coordination and its results represent a degree of progress and success, demonstrating a genuine sense of European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This state of affairs is partly the result of work carried out by the Commission over recent years. This work consisted particularly of the creation of a Community system which gathers all available information relating to the existing Community resources for combating this type of pollution, the establishment of a Community Working Group and the joint financing of the project to develop and improve the techniques for combating pollution within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the emergency proposal, it is also necessary, in the long term, to maintain the capacity to confront other similar disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the Commission is delighted that Parliament has favourably received, at first reading, its draft decision on the establishment of a legal framework which will improve cooperation in combating accidental pollution. The Commission hopes that recent events will speed up the final approval of this text in Parliament and the Council and will therefore allow us to move beyond the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to transport, I would like to say that the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> once again raises the problem of the prevention of marine accidents and, more specifically, safety in the transport of polluting products. In this case, in the field of sea transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that, firstly, it is essential to highlight the fact that the European Union has not been inactive since the notorious sinking of the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> in 1978 off the French coast. Nevertheless, perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we need to do more.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last six years, some fifteen Community regulations and directives have been adopted. This legislation is still recent. The States have now been provided with a legal framework which allows them to tackle the issue of flags of convenience, as well as all of those parties who fail to fulfil their safety obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">It now falls to the Member States to demonstrate that they have the political will to provide their marine authorities with the necessary means to carry out their tasks with regard to control and the application of Community regulations, of applying and adequately demanding compliance with those Community regulations which have already been approved. And, of course, the Commission must be certain to ensure that, in the Member States, these regulations are applied in a consistent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, the results of the preliminary investigation, carried out by the French authorities on the causes of the accident, have been communicated to the Commission. The report demonstrates the lightweight nature – to use a euphemism – of the controls which have been applied in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the Commission, for its part, since 21 December 1999, has approached the Italian authorities in charge of port inspections, as well as the classification society RINA, which was responsible for the most recent classifications of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, with a view to receiving explanations regarding the way that the <span class="italic">Erika </span>has been inspected. The Commission must ascertain whether the relevant Community directives were correctly applied in this case, both by the Italian authorities, as the port state, as well as the company RINA, as the classification society. These checks, Mr President, are essential with regard to perfecting the directives in the future and our ability to improve on the action which is being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to inform Parliament that, on the 28th of next month, a special mission from the Commission will go to inspect the company RINA and, in accordance with the conclusions of this mission, we will take any necessary steps. When I say "we will take the necessary steps ", I include the possibility of removing RINA from the list of companies accredited by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also made a similar request to the maritime authority in Malta – the <span class="italic">Erika </span>was flying the Maltese flag – which, I must point out, has so far offered us its full cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, without pre-empting the results of these investigations – how the sinking happened, what the real reasons were, and how the inspections were carried out, both by RINA<span class="italic"> </span>and by the Italian port authorities –, all indications suggest that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident raises a series of questions which merit close attention and require us, in my opinion, to act with the greatest urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was already preparing a communication on safety in sea transport and port safety. However, these events clearly oblige us to speed up the presentation of this communication and above all to concentrate on the transport of dangerous goods and pollutants, especially oil, gas and chemical products.</p>
<p class="contents">This document will be accompanied by a series of legislative proposals intended to improve maritime safety in Community waters. The Commission intends to adopt them before June of this year, so that the debates on the proposed measures may begin, both in this Parliament and in the Council, as from the second six-month period of 2000, under the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the content of this communication, we basically intend to tackle the following issues:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the tightening up of controls on ‘high-risk’ ships, whatever flag they may sail under, although the statistics speak for themselves: in port inspections, ships carrying the flags of the fifteen Member States of the European Union show around 5.9 incidences per 100 inspections carried out. The world average is around 15.6 incidences in inspections carried out in European ports. In the case of ships flying the Maltese flag – as is the case with the <span class="italic">Erika</span> <span class="bold">–</span> the figure is 19.7 and, in the case of other flags, it is much higher still. In order to strengthen controls, we will amend the existing directives on classification companies, the control of ships in ports and the frequency of inspections, relating them to the age and flag of the ship. In the case of cars, we all know that, after four years, they have to undergo a technical inspection every year. However, in the case of ships, this is unfortunately not the case. We wish to promote these activities – which, furthermore, have been incorporated into the latest international agreements made within the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) by means of the SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) agreements – and make them mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in European ports, we should promote the use of oil tankers which respect the environment. That is to say, the oil tankers which come to our ports should become double hull tankers, instead of the single hull ones which present a greater risk of pollution in the event of accidents. The latter should be subject to measures intended to progressively phase them out more quickly, in the way that is happening in the United States, and we will thereby remove the risk which we are facing at the moment: of oil tankers which cannot dock in American ports being diverted to European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the communication will deal with the complex and delicate issue of liability and the payment of compensation in the event of pollution resulting from a disaster. The Commission intends to escape the current legal quagmire and present proposals to raise the maximum limits of liability of the parties involved and, furthermore, to include new parties in the chain of liability, which at present consists almost exclusively of shipowners.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, we intend to establish a system which will allow us to determine the liability of the owner or forwarder of the cargo and hold them liable – indeed, it is because there are forwarders who show little concern for the quality of the ships they charter that shipowners choose to register their vessels abroad – as well as increasing the insurance premium paid by shipowners in respect of the total sum insured per ship.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission intends to continue in its efforts to improve transparency with regard to the quality of the ships sailing in European waters. In this regard, the Commission proposes to speed up the implementation of the Equasix system, which must be in place as from May of this year, which is no more and no less than a system for up-to-date information on the situation of the international fleet to which all these ships belong. This programme is being developed in common agreement with the French authorities and will provide up-to-date and comprehensive information about the situation of individual ships, not to mention the composition of the crews, which is also an important factor.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is not just a matter of the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster and what has been done up till now, but rather of reaching conclusions so that we can prevent the recurrence of this type of disaster. We must guarantee the effective application of the regulations on maritime safety. The International Maritime Organisation, as we all know, has the capacity neither for controlling nor for making mandatory the regulations subscribed to by some states who often forget their commitments and close their eyes – to put it mildly – to the obligations they have signed up to in these conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must continue to try to achieve greater competitivity in the European shipping sector, which is a sector capable of very high levels of safety, maintaining a high level of requirement, but we must also be capable, with regard to flags of convenience, of combating the abuses which occur in relation to these flags.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we must combat the irresponsibility of some shipowners, some forwarders, some states, some companies and some operators in the field of maritime transport who, through their irresponsibility, endanger our natural environment and may create disasters such as the one which has unfortunately happened recently along the French coastline.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution. I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale. A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why? Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.</p>
<p class="contents">If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred. This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability. Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for. The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies. You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission. What are the conditions for this recognition? What guarantees are there of its reliability? You are going to commission a fact-finding mission. We await the outcome with great interest. Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up. There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned. This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries. Why not? What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw? I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company. If the charterer’s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster. I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year. How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?</p>
<p class="contents">How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds? How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?</p>
<p class="contents">While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'. We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively. We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did. It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions. Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The time for resolutions has passed. What is now needed is action. Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again. In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe. Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died. The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying. We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes? As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice. The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: “With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika. With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar. When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?”</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available. It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, “Never again!” It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport. We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again. But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee. Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes. We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil. Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised? Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea. A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently. In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency. What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available. I can testify to this remarkable work. You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale. In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces. And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats. Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible. In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors’ gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group “<span class="italic">Marée noire</span>”, made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.</p>
<p class="contents">Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field. As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers. Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more. This is no longer tolerable. Next, we have flags of convenience. According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety. This is no longer tolerable. Finally, there is the lack of transparency. Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible. This is no longer tolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels. Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused. I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation. In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity. What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern. Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals. It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies. So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters. Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed. The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO. It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this. Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors. This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency. A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress. The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings. The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July. This must be brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict. I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities. Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally. The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select. Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely. Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future. This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters. Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters. If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided. Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And now the Erika. Whose turn is next? Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers. The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals. It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety. And this is the result. The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz. As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this. There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate. They are the result of human thoughtlessness. What we have here is an ecological disaster. Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that. It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erika disaster must be the last in the series. First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck. Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission? Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported. In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast. We know what actually happened. Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old. We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea. This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium. Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the “polluter pays”, maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate “natural disasters” budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee – making no claim to be exhaustive – a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best. The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money. Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. </p>
<p class="contents">During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more. What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision. Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner? </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection. I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased. Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used. But this is not in place. Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled. In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: “you must push this through in the Council of Ministers”.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are we to do now? I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future. What are we to do now? I will tell you a few things we should do. Of course, we need double-hulled vessels. That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term. So what do we need to happen immediately? We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate. We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years. If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle. This is what we need for ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union. Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges. We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union’s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate. We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability. We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability. This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision! I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future. Environmental standards will be a recurring theme. I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports. The unions will have something to say as will industry. A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen. I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Just you go home and say: “ we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date”. We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports. We need to have a long memory when we say: “ for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union.”</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years’ time! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures. But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led? </p>
<p class="contents">I would compare the situation with an earlier generation’s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels. Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had? I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion. We must also critically examine the classification societies. I do not think that we can accept their procedures. We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards. Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing. It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission’s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick. How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable? How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika’s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting? The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment. They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions. In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations’ capacity to cause damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must stick to the facts. The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years. The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken. I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls. I cannot accept this. If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available. The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue. This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous. It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also share the Commissioner’s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path. If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies. That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit. Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies. There are reputable companies too. You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!</p>

It could have sunk anywhere. It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks. </p>
<p class="contents">My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said. There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men’s lives. By now they are far away. It is a miracle that they were saved. So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast. Things could well continue in the same way. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them. Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union. We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones. We must improve information on all of the world’s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika’s owners? Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan. We would like to know their names and their faces. Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews. In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential. I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources. It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million. This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility. However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented. Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection. I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions. Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet. They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources. These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past. Brittany and Galicia, two European ‘Lands Ends’, fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways. On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta’s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, prevention is essential. Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal – technological, structural and socio-economic – to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations. We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied. That should be the starting point for our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, apart from the shipowners’ liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage. Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified. However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact. This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">Erika</span> catastrophe comes as no surprise. I do not know precisely how many, but any number of ships which are practically floating time bombs in European waters, sail every day, and as far as I can see, a catastrophe of this kind could happen again any day.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been aware of this here in this Parliament for over ten years now – there was the Commission’s communication and the report by Mr Ken Stewart, which made mention even at that stage of all the areas in which legislation needed to be passed. It all revolves around the ships, the technology, the equipment; we are talking about the ports, how they are organised and what they have to say for themselves, and, of course, it is all about teamwork. We know full well where the opposition to every single, solitary legislative measure has come from in the course of the last few years. It always came from the Member States, from the Council of Ministers, where they fought doggedly over every trifling matter, achieving very little in terms of progress.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If we expect car-owning citizens to have a clean bill of health themselves and to fulfil the legal, personal requirements and also have their cars regularly inspected, then it ought to be possible for the same to apply to ships. Control is the key word here. Is it really pure coincidence that, to a lesser or greater extent, it is always the same states that allow these ships to fly under their flags? So why is there no black list? If there are dangerous death traps in European waters, then why do we not say, as is the case elsewhere, that these should not be allowed to enter European waters and call at European ports?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what I would really like to see in your catalogue of measures for the summer is overall inspections for all tankers currently sailing in European waters, and I would also like an update on what the Member States have actually subscribed to and indeed implemented so far, in the way of IMO regulations and conventions, for there is still some dragging of feet there. What happened to Erika cannot be put down to sloppy work, but, as far as I am concerned, to collective, criminal responsibility, and we in Parliament will have the opportunity in the course of the next few months, to demonstrate in the case of one matter in particular, whether we are taking this seriously. I am referring to port reception installations, a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This will come up for discussion again, and when it does, I hope that we will all still hold the same opinions as we do today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented. I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument – a directive, possibly – which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues. I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called ‘ecological hull’ in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures. It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries. I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes. On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport. Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards. I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action. We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary. In this area we must respond to public opinion. This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent. I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations. I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous. </p>
<p class="contents">The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker. So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods. The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection. States can carry out port inspections. </p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive. However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors. It is clear that there is no lack of legislation. In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right. Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation. But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission? Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States? Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored? Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship’s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience. In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements. The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled. There are four more sister ships in service at present. Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high. Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag. Are we waiting for the next accident to happen? </p>
<p class="contents">Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society? RINA is currently the talk of the town. Malta is entering the accession negotiations. In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there. Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are. Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur? Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime. </p>

The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media. Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage. This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions. Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil. There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab. Ultimately, the polluter must pay.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered. Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations. Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations. I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The victims are waiting outside. They want answers. They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through. The citizens are right to ask: “do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?” Who will provide us with new jobs? </p>
<p class="contents">When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge. That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio’s action plan with open arms. It is equally important to note that “prevention is better than cure”. But there is an art to that as well. Deploying the German multipurpose ship “Neuwerk” – it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven – entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help. We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew. Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone. We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament. The issue is as topical as it was before. Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.</p>

<p class="contents">Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem – it is a very important environmental problem – but it is also a very important social problem. There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium. And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done. In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do. This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe. In Europe, after the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span>, or the <span class="italic">Urquiola</span> on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the <span class="italic">Torrey Canyon,</span> in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport. That is the reality. In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention is – and I insist – for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one. The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community. We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end. This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register. I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said. We already have legislation. According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors. The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags. Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels. And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States. We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments. I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo. Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end now. I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. But, obviously, as some speakers have said – and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions – we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.</p>
<p class="contents">As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety. The political will of this Parliament is required – and I can see that I can count on this – as well as that of the Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
