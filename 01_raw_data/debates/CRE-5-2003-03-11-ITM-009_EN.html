This was confirmed by the Court in its now famous 1995 judgment in the Bosman case. In this case-law the Court also held that nationality clauses could only be justified in relation to specific official matches between teams representing countries - such as the Olympic Games - or certain world or European championships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore, with his permission, like to take this opportunity to inform you about the latest developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets that the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, to seek a comprehensive solution to the problem of Cyprus have proved unsuccessful. The Commission gave this process its full support, and it recalls the European Union's readiness to facilitate a solution in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the European Union's preference for a political solution, the Commission confirms that the accession process will continue as planned in line with the existing timetable. All the preparatory legal steps to enable this to take place have already been taken. In other words, we will now submit to Parliament a protocol supplementing the accession treaty with Cyprus and setting forth how Cyprus's accession will be organised under the present circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes and endorses the UN Secretary-General's statement that the peace plan will stay on the table. The Commission is also ready to support all further endeavours in this context. The Commission encourages all the sides concerned, including Turkey in particular, to work actively to achieve a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission underlines its solidarity with all Cypriots and appreciates the courage with which the Turkish Cypriots have expressed their European convictions. The Commission will continue to promote projects in Cyprus to the benefit of both communities, so that economic inequalities on the island are reduced and confidence is built between the two communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my discussions with the Prime Minister and the leader of the AK party and also with other leading figures in Turkish politics, I made it clear that the Commission is expected to issue an opinion and a recommendation at the end of 2004 stating whether or not Turkey meets the political criteria for accession and, if so, recommending when accession negotiations with Turkey should start.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say very clearly that the Cyprus problem is part and parcel of these political criteria for accession. We have also expressed this unequivocally in the accession partnership with Turkey. Today, what I can say, with all due caution, is that if, at the end of 2004 – when the Commission has to table its report and recommendation – the situation in Cyprus were to remain unchanged, that is be exactly the same as it is today, then we would have a situation where a country, namely Turkey, wished to negotiate accession with us but did not recognise one of our Member States, namely Cyprus. I find it very difficult to imagine how, in such a situation, the Commission could issue a positive opinion on starting accession negotiations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for my inability to be any clearer, and, indeed, for my not wishing to be any clearer, but I think that what I have said is clear enough. If you consider what I have just said in connection with what I have said about the protocol, then this means that there is obviously still an opportunity for a solution to be reached between now and the end of 2004. That is why both the United Nations and the European Union are saying that yesterday's failure does not mean that the Cyprus problem is a closed book, but that as soon as the political situation allows, obviously, talks about the plan can be resumed. It is very important for the United Nations plan to remain on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one further point: the most recent version of the United Nations plan was an extremely favourable offer, especially for the Turkish Cypriots. I am firmly convinced that there will never be a better offer or a better solution for the Turkish Cypriots than this one. That is why it is extremely important from the point of view of the Turkish Cypriots for the United Nations to say that the plan will stay on the table. We can only warmly welcome this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only has the process to integrate Cyprus into the European Union failed to resolve the Cyprus question; by integrating the free part of Cyprus, it has resulted in <span class="italic">de jure</span> partition and recognition of the Turkish occupation. Not that things would have been much better had the two sides accepted the Annan plan which, unlike the UN resolutions, attempted to impose a particular form of federation which was not so very different from the recognition of two states in Cyprus, in other words partition.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances I wonder, Commissioner, how the Commission is going to deal with a situation in which a candidate country, in this case Turkey, has forces occupying and has colonised part of a country which is already a Member State of the European Union, in violation of numerous UN resolutions. I am not just talking about resolving the Cyprus problem, I am talking about dealing with the occupation.

The protocol that I have already mentioned several times makes it absolutely clear that Community law will not be applied in those parts of Cyprus over which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus cannot exert effective control. But this is not tantamount to recognising two Cypriot states. Like the rest of the international community, we still regard the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the representative of the whole of Cyprus, as its only legitimate representative under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">From a purely legal point of view, the whole of Cyprus will become a Member of the European Union. In practice, Community law will not be able to be applied in part of the territory of Cyprus for as long as there is no political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Once there is a political solution – whenever this may be – all that will be required will be a unanimous decision by the Council and the whole of Cyprus will be a Member, both <span class="italic">de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span>. We would not need to hold further negotiations. Neither would another Treaty be required, or renewed ratification. All of these matters are settled in the protocol, which is part of the Act of Accession.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Commission do to improve the situation? I think the most important thing that we can do is to continue to cooperate intensively with Turkey, to continue to use all of the means at our disposal to encourage Turkey to drive forward political, economic and social reforms and to meet the political accession criteria. That is the only thing that we can do. At the end of the day it is also the only thing that will help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The formal complaint came from the Media Observatory Czech Republic, and has been endorsed by the company Media Print &amp; Kappa Pressegrosso. It stated that alleged violations of EC competition law had been observed in the Czech Republic. Both I myself, and the EU delegation in Prague, have also had this matter drawn to our attention in conversations with the chairman of the Media Observatory Czech Republic. And I can tell you that immediately afterwards I had the opportunity to raise this issue with the Czech Government at the very highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, the Commission is of the opinion that it is first and foremost the Czech competition authorities and courts that are responsible for the matter, because it mainly concerns distortions of competition on the Czech market in print media. Nevertheless, the Commission services have contacted the Czech competition supervision authorities. The Czech supervision authorities are currently examining the case and recently issued a temporary order against the company Prvni Novinova Spolecnost and its parent company for possible violations of the Czech competition rules. I hope I pronounced that correctly. I am not quite sure. Czech is a difficult language!</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of legislative provisions by the Czech competition authorities is being closely monitored in the run-up to accession, and with this in mind the Commission will continue to observe progress on this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member of Parliament, you are of course free to express a political judgment. As a Member of the Commission, I obviously cannot make a political assessment of a case when the legal proceedings are not yet concluded. You will understand this and you would certainly object – and rightly so – if the Commission were to express an opinion in other cases that are <span class="italic">sub judice</span> and where the proceedings have not yet been concluded. I must therefore say that I simply do not know today whether we do in fact have a breach of competition law on our hands. The question of whether competition law has been violated is being investigated at this very moment by the Czech authorities, and the Commission services are in contact with the Czech authorities because it is our job to ensure that in the pre-accession phase the relevant instruments are correctly applied and the relevant procedures adhered to. That is the connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, if this had happened after accession it would not have made any difference. There is no doubt that this is a case for the national competition authorities and not for the European competition authorities because it is only the domestic Czech market that is affected by this dispute. The Commission is therefore already doing what you asked me to do at the end of your statement. We are acting on this matter. I can even go a step further and say that given that this is about media pluralism and given that media pluralism plays a significant role in promoting democracy in a country, the Commission is also taking this case particularly seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Accession negotiations with Slovakia and the Roma minorities</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution of 20 November 2002 (Paragraph 114) the European Parliament urged the Slovak Government to undertake decisive action to overcome the problems of discrimination against the Roma minorities, in particular with regard to the elimination of possible discriminatory practices by state institutions and public authorities. In late January 2003, the Centre for Reproductive Rights published an investigative report confirming that forced sterilisation was being practised on Roma women in the Slovak health-care system.</p>
<p class="contents"> Does the Commission share the questioner's view that these practices amount to a violation of the Copenhagen criteria and of Articles 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the European Union Convention on Fundamental Rights?

I also found the reports to which you refer deeply disturbing. I read the report on the alleged forced sterilisation of women from the Roma minority in the Slovak Republic with great concern and consternation. A practice of this kind would in fact constitute a serious violation of human rights if it were either ordered or at least tolerated by the state or any other public institution, or if the state were to refuse to investigate the accusations and call those responsible to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after this report appeared I therefore expressed my concerns to the Slovak Prime Minister, both verbally and in writing, and asking him to ensure that light was shed quickly on the accusations, which have been made by various human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to be able to tell you that the Slovak Government responded immediately and without hesitation. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic responsible for human rights issues acted straight away to instigate the necessary steps under criminal law. A special investigation team was set up. This investigation team is supported by the Home Affairs Minister's advisor on Roma issues. This Home Office advisor for Roma issues himself belongs to the Roma minority. In addition, the government has invited the Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Health to the Slovak Republic on a fact-finding mission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime I have also received a written reply from the Slovak Prime Minister in which he assures me that there is no state-sponsored practice of this kind in the Slovak Republic, that the accusations are the subject of a meticulous investigation and that should they prove to be true the full force of the law will be brought to bear in taking action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission will closely monitor the progress of the investigations. Obviously we will do all we can to ensure that any abuses are remedied forthwith and that the necessary steps are taken under criminal law, should the accusations be true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At any rate your supplementary question does not reflect what I said. I did not say that the Slovak Government had dismissed the accusations as untrue. I simply said that the Slovak Government stressed that there was no state-sponsored practice of this kind, that the state did not tolerate these practices and that the accusations that you and others are making were the subject of a meticulous investigation by the competent authorities. If the Slovak Government were to say that there was no truth in these accusations then it would not need to order an investigation. I would ask you not to be too quick to condemn another country. So far, in my opinion, there is no proof that this is a systematic state practice. Instead the suspicion that is uppermost in my mind is that what we have here are individual cases of abuse, admittedly of the gravest kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I must draw your attention to the fact that the Commission does not have any executive power in the countries that will be joining us. It is therefore completely out of the question for us to undertake a criminal or criminological investigation in a future Member State, just as we would be unable to do so in a current Member State. We have done what we can to use our political influence to make the Government of the Slovak Republic aware of the urgency of this matter and to ask it to carry out a thorough investigation.</p>

On a slightly wider point, I visited, albeit a year or so ago, Bratislava and Kosice with a parliament delegation and we looked at the conditions of the Roma people there. What I saw was that, despite the commitments of the government, the discrimination continues, partly because it seems to be ingrained in the society and almost institutionalised. There are poorer conditions for Roma people, fewer facilities, nowhere near the same number of opportunities and generally they are far more alienated from society, for example in schools where there was no evidence of mother-tongue teaching, no evidence of any Roma teachers at all.</p>

There is barely no other issue either that I myself, and the Commission as a whole, are working on as intensively as this one.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost I must remind you that discrimination against Roma is not only a sad fact of life in the future Member States, but that unfortunately we also find this in a whole series of current Member States. It is just that it is not as noticeable in the figures because there are not as many of them in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial point here is whether the constitution, the judicial system and the state administration system in the future Member States really do discriminate against the Roma or not. Our investigations – in agreement incidentally with the Council of Europe and a considerable number of human rights organisations – show that there is no as it were institutionalised discrimination against the Roma in either the constitution, legislation or administrative structure of these countries. What we do find is deeply rooted, traditional discrimination in society, which in some parts of these countries has taken on really tragic proportions. However, I must repeat that this is nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts have focused on ensuring that these countries develop a strategy to reduce the discrimination against the Roma. We have made it a political precondition for the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations for such strategies to exist and be in force. I have, however, always said – including here in this House – that we cannot expect social discrimination against the Roma to have been completely eliminated at the time of accession of the new Members. Neither can we say that there is absolutely no discrimination in the present Member States. I could name a series of cases of discrimination in our current Member States where we are also not saying that the fact that people are being discriminated against constitutes a violation of the Treaty. Instead we say that European Community law requires measures to be taken to put an end to this discrimination. That is the situation that we find in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In its pre-accession instruments the Commission addressed the needs of the Roma minorities in a big way. It has deployed a great deal of money, made significant human resources available and provided considerable advice to help the future Member States to develop and also apply a strategy to combat discrimination against the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that you will find anyone for miles around who is better acquainted with the reality of the situation faced by the Roma in these countries than I am. I never let a visit to these countries go by without addressing this problem directly and on the spot. I do not do this because I believe that I can solve the problem by visiting a Roma settlement, a Roma school or whatever it may be; I do it to make a powerful and symbolic contribution to shaping political ideas. I want the people in these countries to see on their television screens that when the Commission comes to their country it does not regard the Roma as untouchables, but as a section of the population that needs particular attention and particular care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event they have told us, in response to an earlier question, that problems had already been reported and I asked a question about this together with Mrs van Lancker, Mrs Maes and I believe Mrs van Brempt as well. In response you said that just as much food is being distributed as before and then we have the disconcerting assessment that in fact 750 tonnes less are being distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat my question: can you confirm here that in terms of quantities – I am not talking about figures or about values – just as much food was made available in 2002 as in the years before? Have I understood that properly? If I have indeed understood that properly, then I shall be putting further questions to the Belgian Government through the federal advisory committee for European affairs in the Chamber and Senate and with fellow Members of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also said, however, that you need to bear three different things in mind here. First of all, as I said, it is the Belgian authorities that are responsible for dividing the food between various charitable organisations, which then pass this on to disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p class="contents">How much each organisation gets is therefore decided by the Belgian authorities, and it may well be the case that the organisation that you mentioned received less, but this would mean that another organisation would have received more. The only way of finding this out is, however, by contacting the Belgian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that there is also a link between the Community and Belgium because, as you know, we have provided a financial grant, but we do not give this grant to the individual organisation, we give it to the Member State. We then leave it up to the Belgian State to divide these resources amongst the individual charitable organisations in accordance with its particular priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This rigid definition of a fishing day fails to tie in with the fishing practices of many fishermen.

The debate is a general one about the means by which we can on the one hand rescue our endangered cod stocks and on the other hand do so in such a way as to avoid the fishermen concerned suffering severe hardship.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now specifically to industrial fishing, I can only say that we have been working on this issue for years. We have also obtained relevant reports from scientists to ascertain whether fishing for sand eels does actually as it were take the food from the mouths of young fish and young cod in particular. We were told that this is only true to a very limited extent. In addition, you will also see from the stock surveys that the sand eel stocks continue to be very large and are not in decline. These stocks are in fact stable; we do not have a problem there.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one problem with industrial fishing and that is the risk of cod being caught as a by-catch. It is certainly important to monitor what happens here. The experts are telling us, however, that these by-catches have fallen significantly thanks to new fishing technologies and that in the future it will be possible to virtually eliminate them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All eligible farmers, including of course young farmers, who have already received direct payments under the old system, have an equal claim.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, under Article 49 of our proposal, these claims can be passed on, either through specific bequests or by anticipating the line of succession. This provision takes account of customary practice in Europe when a holding is taken over by young farmers. In addition the proposal also specifically accommodates new farmers. Article 45 provides for a national reserve in the Member States. Reference amounts can be allocated from this reserve for the single payment to farmers who started their farming activity only after 31 December 2000. Finally, it goes without saying that reference amounts need to be allocated to new farmers in accordance with objective criteria and according to the principle of equal treatment, so as to avoid distortions of the market or competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if a farmer – and that obviously includes a young farmer – can prove that his production has been reduced in the reference period because of <span class="italic">force majeure</span> or other unusual circumstances, then he can claim that his case is one of hardship.

If the proposal were to be accepted, farmers would be penalised if they failed to comply with any of the directives, of which there are about forty, that they would be called upon to observe. The Commission’s proposed reform will entail a substantial increase in production costs, which will be offset only in part by the new accompanying measure provided for under the heading of rural development in order to help farmers obey the rules. The new rural development aid being proposed by the Commission is a partial and temporary solution because it will decrease over time.</p>

In the context of these newly proposed measures to achieve compliance with standards, farmers can receive aid for a new standard for five years, if applying it involves additional costs and obligations for the farmer. The aid that is granted for applying a particular standard is limited in time, but the measure itself is not.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as funding the measures on rural development is concerned, by introducing modulation the Commission is also laying the foundations for increasing the relevant budgetary funds. Despite our efforts to secure the future of European farmers and promote important European trade interests, one of the most important objectives of the European proposals made in January for the WTO negotiations is that in the current negotiating round non-trade-related matters – such as food safety or the protection of designations of origin, or animal and environmental protection – be treated on an equal footing. The Commission has already responded several times in no uncertain terms to the first proposal of modalities for the agriculture negotiations that was tabled on 12 February by Mr Harbinson, and it will continue to defend the European negotiating position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Other things have been left out, however, which have already been debated in the special committees on agriculture. For example, with regard to rice, he knows that the subsidy price has been reduced by 60%, that internal production has stabilised and that consumption has increased by 20%. However, for five years the situation has been unsustainable for rice producers, who are facing an increasingly bleak future, as a result of the Everything but Arms decisions and imports of basmati rice, which do not correspond either in terms of their characteristics or their origins.</p>
<p class="contents">We could also consider garlic, mushrooms, honey, tomato, rice, wine, concentrated juices, etc., and we would see that the quality, the safety of products imported, as well as the production methods, both in terms of animal welfare and in terms of guaranteeing quality and the environment, are not subject to any control.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you what supplementary measures are subject to the supervision of the Commission, but do not tell me that control falls to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In your question, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, you did not ask for example what is going to happen to the rice regime or what the situation is with food safety for imports. What is more, this is not even a subject for which I am responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would however like to comment briefly on what you said. Firstly then, why do we need a rice reform? We do not need it because of imports of basmati rice, which are I might add very limited, something which incidentally greatly annoys the Indians, who are therefore constantly trying to have their export quota to the European Union increased. We need it as a result of the decision – which by the way was also made here in Parliament – to give the world's poorest countries the right to export all of the goods that they produce, without any restrictions, to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the world's poorest countries include a whole series of rice producers. That is why our current rice regime will no longer work in the future and why we need to change it. The objective of the reform has to be on the one hand to address the consequences of this external trade policy and on the other to ensure that at the same time the typical landscapes are preserved in traditional rice-growing areas, such as in southern Spain, where there is of course even a national park where rice is the main crop.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the question of import controls. This may not be what you want to hear, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, but products that are imported through Spanish ports or via any other border post in Spain by train or lorry have to be checked at the border to ascertain whether they meet plant health and veterinary requirements. All that the European authorities, for example the Veterinary Office in Dublin, can do is to introduce a control plan to check that the border inspections are actually working. This is, however, as I said, the responsibility of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we guarantee that? How can it be controlled? Will we put a label on every grain of rice?

And if they wish they can also import rice for their own use. That is part of the decision that was made in this House. Incidentally, I might add that I expressed my own misgivings about this from the outset. But the decision was made and I stand by it. Now there is only one thing that we can do, and that is to be vigilant and ensure that no foreign rice that has not even been produced in these countries is exported to the European Union. How can we ensure that this is the case? We can do so by using those instruments that we also use in all other areas to check the origin of a product. This requires proof of origin, certificates and checks by the appropriate teams of inspectors, and in some cases on-the-spot checks or analyses are also necessary. In some cases it is certainly possible to tell by analysing the imported rice whether it really is from the country of origin indicated or not, and this does happen in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
