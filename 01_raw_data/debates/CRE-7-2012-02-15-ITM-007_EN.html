At this difficult time, efforts to stabilise the economic markets should be an obvious solution. We can only achieve this through decisive and coordinated action as part of budgetary policy, with a focus on developing innovation. Furthermore, it is important to create new jobs, particularly for young people, to reduce the costs of these jobs, and to review fiscal policy and reduce the burdens associated with ever-increasing bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is supposed to be the consequence of realising the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, so they have to be addressed consistently and with attention given to the education and labour sectors.

In particular, this has affected young people, pensioners, the disabled, the long-term unemployed and low-skilled workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the reality is that poverty among working people in the European Union is on the increase. This means that jobs are increasingly poor quality, unsafe and low paid, and therefore, at the European Council, it must be stressed that measures on budgetary management, economic growth and employment must be assessed together because they are all interdependent and a precondition for economic recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is impossible to reconcile this approach with the principles of social justice, growth and promoting employment, as they advocate exactly the opposite: namely, cutting wage costs, increasing the exploitation of the workers and shrinking the state, as well as an attack on the social and labour rights that have been acquired.</p>
<p class="contents">These so-called ‘budget consolidation’ policies are causing real social tragedy and disaster, such as increased poverty, in addition to merely deepening the economic recession and increasing public debt. What is needed is a complete break with this path. A Europe based on cooperation needs to be built, with the principal objectives of defending the interests of the peoples and of putting a stop to processes of oppression and colonisation by the major powers. Last Saturday, on the streets of Lisbon, Portugal, more than 300 000 people demanded an end to the austerity measures and promised that the struggle will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The greatest problem of European countries at the moment is the debt crisis, but we must not shift the burdens of the management of this crisis on to the citizens to a disproportionate extent. In the light of the events of the past few years, the widespread notion in the developed world that the gradual, at times more rapid, at other times slower, increase in living standards is irreversible and that future generations will be better off than we are has become questionable. This notion could be reinforced by budgetary consolidation, while we sacrifice economic growth, job creation and social responsibility at the altar of macro-economic stability. I hope that in a few years, we will not look back on the year 2012 as a missed opportunity to prevent social tensions erupting as a result of a social crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is time we stopped just looking at the stick and started looking at the carrot.</p>

Merely blocking up holes is not a solution.

That will certainly speed up economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also important for the European Union to monitor whether the funds that are made available are actually being properly used. Only under these circumstances will we gain the acceptance of citizens in particular in those Member States which have plenty of funds available and which have managed their budgets properly over the years. All our previous experiences have shown that while trust is a good thing, a community based on solidarity also requires the necessary monitoring measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, both the reports tabled and the Commission’s speech are contradicted here and there by the dramatic reality within the Member States. Once the unemployed are removed from the payment of benefits, at least in Romania, they disappear both from statistics and as a government concern. They no longer exist in the package of society’s turmoil, concerns and worries. The pension reform and labour market flexibility that has been discussed here are also very nice, very important, but in Romania, under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, this reform was accomplished, which means this: the complete dismantling of the legislative and institutional framework regulating the activity of trade unions, the dismantling of the Labour Code, the actual dissolution of the Economic and Social Council, and the refusal of social partners to continue their participation in mimicking the so-called dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not seek recovery and a response to this turmoil, Romania remains just a part of European statistics – but it is still a Member State! I would like to think that we will come out of this liberal aberration and will try to find answers.

First, I believe there is a broad convergence of views on the key policy priorities for 2012, on the higher priority for growth and the urgency of reform implementation, and on the fact that we should take action on employment and not just talk. I think there is an agreement that we have to work for improved consistency between the long-term objectives for economic and social development, as explained in the Europe 2020 strategy, and short-term measures to create stability in Europe and particularly in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">This convergence of views is comforting for the Commission. I believe that political support from the elected representatives of European citizens for these policy priorities will enhance the credibility of the relevant reforms and thus have a positive impact on confidence. However, based on different political views and approaches, there are differing approaches and emphasis on particular instruments – how exactly we should approach our goals for economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you the Commission’s view on what exactly we think needs to be done for growth and particularly for more jobs in this period. In the discussion, I think there was sufficient attention and appreciation for the Youth Opportunities initiatives, and I am grateful for the positive remarks on this Commission document, in which we relaunched the campaign for a youth guarantee in Europe. I would like to thank those such as Mr Őry, Ms Bastos and Ms Gurmai who mentioned this youth guarantee in a positive light, because I believe this is a very important measure. The Commission can provide technical support for the Member States which are ready to go down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is very important, as many participants in the discussion stressed, to improve education and training according to the needs of the labour market in order to create a better match between the supply of and the demand for labour. These aspects will be covered in the country-specific recommendations at the end of this semester.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as we needed to update and upgrade the Youth on the Move flagship initiative in the form of the Youth Opportunities initiative, we are also working on an upgrade and an update of our employment policy in the form of an employment package to be presented in April. This will respond to and connect with many issues which you stressed in the discussion, such as how flexicurity policies are helping to develop the European labour market following Denmark’s inspirational example, but also how we want to work more effectively in order to create green jobs, because this is one of the areas where employment will increase in the coming period. We have to ensure that green jobs also appear in Europe and not only in other continents, where this is also a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to green jobs, we also have to look at white coat jobs in the health and care sector and the ICT sectors, which will be a bigger employer in the future. This employment package will also deliver the quality framework on traineeships which many of you called for. I share the view that we have to do a lot more – and do it more effectively – to ensure quality jobs and opportunities for young people, and this quality framework will be a key instrument in addressing this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to do more for enterprise, including for SMEs. I think this is again an important point – but let us see what the real bottleneck is in the context of enterprise and SMEs. Perhaps we can do more for smarter regulation – efforts are also being made to streamline regulation inside the Commission – but I believe the real bottleneck is finance. We have to ensure that the banking sector gives more support to enterprise and SMEs, and we can also promote a micro-finance facility. This has already been introduced in about one third of the Member States, and my services are working with other Member States to introduce the Progress Micro-finance Facility in a more rapid manner and support SMEs across Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that in my view, the greatest challenge at this time in terms of economic governance is to deal with the increasing polarisation within the European Union. It is not simply about diversity. We have already learned and applied the principle that there is no one size that fits all: we have to take differences into account. But we are now experiencing something which is more serious than that: an increasing asymmetry – a polarisation – between Member States that are relatively strong financially and economically, in terms of employment performance and social stability, and other Member States – largely those on the periphery – where all this is more difficult and where, instead of recovery, many Member States experienced a recession this year and the risk of losing a generation. For many of these Member States, like Ireland, Portugal and Greece, there is significant out-migration, which also means out-migration from Europe, because young people do not see the opportunities and they do not see them returning in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful for the comment from Latvia, because this also demonstrates that, although some stability has been restored, this example should not be used as a model for other countries, especially the southern countries looking for an exit from recession and financial instability.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the European Semester is a learning process for all parties involved. With the help of the European Parliament, important lessons have been drawn from the first European Semester, and presenting the Annual Growth Survey earlier has left much more room for debate this time round. The Commission has done this because it recognises the importance of open debate and democratic accountability for the success of the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is keen to contribute to strengthening the strategy’s governance – notably through improved monitoring of employment and social targets – and to bolster the political ownership that is vital for its success. This is very much about sustaining the Europe 2020 strategy and its content and its objectives – together with numerical targets – instead of abandoning them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to being involved, we also need you to help us strengthen our links with the national parliaments in order to anchor our 2020 objectives in national political agendas as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has been the key word from every speaker in this debate on growth and unemployment that has lasted over an hour.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a key issue and we have to find ways to address it. It is important to grasp all the nuances here because there is no necessary contradiction between consolidation and growth. It is all a question of priorities: very hard, very difficult priorities in our budgets. We can no longer just discuss this and ask: ‘who is going to spend the next million or the next billion’? We have to discuss how we are spending in general and make sure that we get our priories right; that is important in any parliament; that is important in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we have our priorities right? I think that is a key question and answering it entails a great deal of conflict, because if we want to change our priorities, we will have to have debates that actually change things and concern the people who are the beneficiaries of the present budget and the present way of spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the fact that greening our economy is part of the answer. I know that some people think that we will have to wait, but greening our economy is part of the answer: being more efficient in the way that we use our resources and, in so doing, creating more space for the most important resource we have: human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to take note of the Commission’s five priorities because they are important steps in actually reaching the goals of Europe 2020. We must make sure that we pursue differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. Second: we must restore normal lending to the economy because SMEs cannot create jobs if they cannot borrow, if their credit line is cut. So normal lending is very important. Third: we must promote growth and competitiveness for tomorrow. A lot of the proposals already tabled are heading in exactly that direction. Fourth, as we have been discussing today, we must tackle unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis. And fifth – perhaps an undervalued point – public administration must be modernised to make sure that we actually help enterprise to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the important issues and I think that labour market reforms should also be understood as a way of facilitating young people’s entry to work, making sure that they are actually taken on by enterprises and giving them a chance to show that they can actually participate, and that their work is also beneficial to their enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, this is an important debate because it forms part of a long series of debates that Parliament has held in the past and which we will continue to have in the future. Solving the crisis is a very long and very demanding task for everybody. It takes cooperation and when we discuss solutions – be it some of the things that I have mentioned, some of the things mentioned by the Commissioner, or a number of the things mentioned in the three reports that we have been discussing today – a major challenge is to make sure that we cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much looking forward to continuing cooperation with Parliament on the proposals already tabled, and making sure that we can make it obvious that there is no necessary contradiction between wise consolidation and growth within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Special thanks go to Mr Gauzès and Ms Berès for the excellent cooperation on our reports. I am very proud to form a troika together with you, to refer to what Ms Rapti said.</p>
<p class="contents">We have shown that it is possible to deliver complementary views from the economic and the social side, and I am happy with the broad support expressed in this House for our work.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, Ms Harkin, that both deficit and surplus countries should be addressed. Unfortunately, in yesterday’s alert mechanism report, surplus countries like the Netherlands and Germany were unaffected. I hope Ms Harkin will be able to support the paragraph in my report that counters this asymmetrical approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that the call for a job-rich recovery, expressing worries about rising poverty, is growing louder in all institutions and all political groups. What I am afraid of now is that this call will remain lip service. We need measures to give the employment and social goals the power and standing to rise to the level of the budgetary ones, so perhaps we need an excessive unemployment procedure and an excessive poverty-increase procedure. Why not expand what was once the ‘six-pack’ – and is now going to be the ‘eight-pack’ – immediately to a ‘ten-pack’, in order also to include the social and employment goals. And let us differentiate our approach, to give all Member States a prospect of recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I, too, would like to commend the excellent cooperation between the rapporteurs, Ms Cornelissen, Ms Berès and myself and the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance of the debate, I would like to say that what is needed today is for words to be backed up by actions, and that is undoubtedly the hardest thing to achieve. As regards its form, I would like to point out that the 2012 European Semester will be the first to come under the new legal framework of enhanced economic governance. In order to ensure that Parliament is well informed, we urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission provides a detailed assessment of the implementation, by the Member States, of the recommendations in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, for its part, is required to provide a public explanation of its position within the framework of economic dialogue with Parliament, when its position deviates significantly from the Commission’s recommendations and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the States can retain a degree of discretion under the principle of subsidiarity. The new legal framework stipulates that Parliament must be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency and accountability for decisions, particularly through economic dialogue, as provided for by the relevant secondary legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I should like to conclude by reminding you of the requests made by Parliament to the Council and the Commission in its resolution of 1 December 2011. It is important to give this resolution a precise public response. The reality and effectiveness of the democratic control for which this Parliament is responsible depends on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures such as continued medium and long-term investment to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as making investments to stimulate economic growth in the short term, may prove to be the instruments through which the confidence of European citizens and financial markets in the commercial and industrial capacity of the European Union can be restored. It is equally important for the success of the EU’s economic strategies for Member States to implement in their practices a number of elements agreed at European level, as soon as possible. The success of European economic recovery depends essentially on the creation of a fiscal consolidation policy to encourage economic growth, the adoption of measures to prevent the escalation of youth unemployment, and the launch of timely measures to prevent marginalisation and social isolation in accordance with the European strategic documents. I express my support for the adoption of Parliament’s proposals. The use of Structural Funds to redress these temporary economic imbalances, based on close cooperation between the Commission and Member States, along with strengthening the single market, the development of the digital economy and cutting back institutional bureaucracy are solutions to be considered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The growing unemployment rate, the increased risk of poverty and social exclusion, together with the uncertainty among the employed, are some of the problems that we are confronted with, and which require fast and appropriate measures. Given that resources have been restricted by the crisis, we need to concentrate our efforts on policies that enable growth and sustainable development as much as possible. It is therefore imperative for these to form the broad basis of the Annual Growth Survey 2012. Member States and the Commission must guarantee the implementation of rapid, coordinated measures to improve labour market conditions with particular emphasis given to young people, women and other vulnerable groups. The fight against unemployment, especially among young people, must become a leading priority that is supported by measures for education, professional development, traineeships and for encouraging entrepreneurship. Establishing a closer link between education and business needs is also important as it would guarantee increased potential for professional development among graduates as well.

It is very important that the sector of employment and social affairs is not overshadowed by the focus on fiscal consolidation, and that the headline target of increasing employment is kept on the agenda and further promoted by investing in sustainable job creation. It must be ensured that consolidation measures will not have further negative impacts on people at risk of poverty and/or social exclusion. The Commission should therefore put more emphasis on guiding Member States in coordinating their national reform programmes with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular increasing employment and introducing effective incentives for work. The successful launch of the national Roma inclusion strategies and its European framework is indispensable in this respect, since Roma constitute a huge reserve of idle workforce and are disproportionately over-represented among those living in poverty. Increasing the employment of Roma – so that this approximates to the regional average – would already trigger substantial economic growth that many countries with a significant Roma population and hit by the sovereign debt crisis are so desperately in need of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the decline across a wide range of artificial indicators such as GDP, there has been a significant fall in employment and domestic consumption in individual states. We also see a substantial increase in the number of people in EU Member States who have a job and receive pay, but the pay is so low that, even under the ever worsening and ever stricter criteria for providing the various social contributions, these people are entitled to various types of benefit in relation to their low pay. Unfortunately, over the past 20 years, it has typically been the case that employment in the primary and secondary sectors has fallen significantly, and employment in the agricultural and forestry sectors has fallen very significantly. A former key sector for employment in industrially developed states, that is to say industry, has become a marginal factor, particularly in the countries of central and eastern Europe. In the old EU states, the emphasis in former times on the development of industry has shifted to support for the development of services. In the service sector, unfortunately, many areas are really in a crisis situation as regards securing employment, and are very risky in terms of workers’ earnings in these areas. The solution is to support industry and apprenticeships, increase the minimum wage, protect jobs, develop specialist training and to have progressive taxation of both legal and physical entities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis has also affected people who are approaching retirement age, the long-term unemployed and unskilled workers. The commitments made in the national reform programmes are not sufficient to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy in employment, education and poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore focus on integrated reform measures that promote growth in the short, medium and long terms.</p>
<p class="contents">In its policy guidelines, the European Council must ensure that EU funds will be allocated to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council must, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, approve guidelines aimed at increasing revenues through fair, progressive, redistributive, effective and efficient taxation, in order to help combat tax evasion through better tax coordination, ensure the fairness of the system, and maintain social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the areas of economic activity, these three categories are particularly prevalent in some Member States in agriculture. Therefore, I believe that the measures taken to encourage setting up young farmers by taking over some farms or expanding holdings, as well as the anticipated pension systems for elderly farmers, must also continue in the future common agricultural policy. It should be noted that rural workers, young and old, are in a very special situation that requires particular solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The social consequences of the crisis are very severe, and are further exacerbated by the impact of the austerity measures adopted in some countries in response to the sovereign debt crisis, by the job losses in the private and public sectors, and by the decrease in the provision of social insurance services and public services, leading to the aggravation of poverty cases across the EU. According to Eurostat, since 2010, 41.4% of the population of Romania have faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion, representing 8.89 million people out of a total population of 21.47 million. The Eurostat figure for Bulgaria is 42%, for Latvia 38%, for Lithuania 33%, and for Hungary, 30%. The initiatives that facilitate the development of sectors with the greatest potential for employment should be supported at European level, particularly in the transition to a sustainable economy (‘green jobs’), social and health services (‘white coat jobs’) and digital economy. Emphasis must also be placed on the strategy to combat youth unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sends out a powerful signal to the spring meeting of the European Council which will help to ensure that those countries hardest hit by the crisis are the ones which receive assistance. Current economic figures show that the stringent austerity measures being taken in some countries will not result in a recovery. We need to invest, particularly in the citizens of Europe, in order to bring about a change of direction. Effective initiatives and concrete resources are required to stimulate growth. Therefore, I am pleased that the report contains a reference to the financial transaction tax. However, what is missing in the Annual Growth Survey is a focus on the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. To me, there seems to be a lack of coherence in this area, because these goals should be our highest priority. This applies, in particular, to youth unemployment. The previous declarations of intent must be followed by concrete initiatives to create jobs for young people, so that we can give them hope. It is also very important to me that the report refers to macro-economic imbalances. Deleting this reference would be a questionable move, most importantly because these imbalances were the main factors which triggered the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, over 5 million young people in the European Union are unemployed, which means that one in five young people in the labour market cannot find work. In Poland, at the beginning of 2011, there were almost half a million people under the age of 25 registered with employment offices as unemployed. School leavers and university graduates cannot find work; reasons for this include the fact that they lack experience, and it is currently very difficult to gain that experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We should follow the example of Germany and France, where, during the period of an employee’s training, the employer’s social insurance contributions are paid from an unemployment insurance fund. This encourages employers to take on young people. It is essential to have standards governing the quality of traineeships for young people. After a traineeship, young people must have the knowledge and skills necessary in a particular labour market. On 1 February 2012, all the Union’s Member States agreed to develop their own plan on employment for young people and support for small enterprises. Some are even going to create special action groups to prevent youth unemployment. I hope these plans will be made as quickly as possible, because the situation for young people in the labour market is, quite frankly, desperate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly necessary in the employment sector and the labour market. Unemployment in the EU has increased significantly since 2008 and has reached a level of 23 million people, corresponding to 10% of the working age population. This is the average figure for the whole Union and there are, of course, Member States with a much higher unemployment rate, chiefly the EU’s new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market situation is exceptionally difficult for young people, regardless of their education, and they often end up with precarious employment contracts. If the potential of the younger generation in the economy is not to be lost, the European Council needs to make tackling youth unemployment a priority and to develop an effective strategy for young people in the European Union. This strategy should be developed in close cooperation with the social partners and should include a European Youth Guarantee, on the basis of which the Member States would guarantee every young person in the EU the right to be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training after a maximum period of not more than six months’ unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar initiatives are to be found in the Cornelissen report and deserve to be analysed on their merits. This should go together with budgetary incentives from the European Council for investments in sustainable job creation in as many sectors of the economy as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the European Parliament nor the national parliaments have any say or any right of control over the final policy guidelines. This, in itself, was not a disaster as long as these policy guidelines were being used as they were intended: as directives. However, there is a gradual shift taking place whereby these directives are suddenly taking on a much more coercive character. One such example is the commitment of the Heads of State or Government at last December’s European summit to full adherence to these directives. Depriving parliaments (whether European or national) of the right to codecide in such cases means undermining the democratic process. After all, you can already see the consequences: the social dimension has become the Cinderella of the policy guidelines and is being completely overshadowed by macro-economic and budgetary objectives. However, we cannot have one without the other, and I hope that the European Council will also recognise this and give the social dimension of the guidelines the role it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
