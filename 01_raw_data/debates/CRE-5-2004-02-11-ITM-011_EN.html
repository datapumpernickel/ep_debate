If I count up all the issues, directives and regulations over the years, I think I am right in saying that I win hands down. In any case, I think that we all agree on the importance of what we are discussing today, the entry into force of the 2003 Protocol to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage (IOPC). The funds for compensating victims of oil slicks are going to be increased to more than five times their current level, which is absolutely essential as it was clear from accidents such as the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> that the funds available through IOPC were not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The Protocol still needs to come into force and we therefore need to encourage the Member States of the Union to ratify it quickly. We are convinced that it urgently needs to be applied, but unfortunately, the Member States are not taking the step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal that it put forward in September, the Commission urged the Member States to ratify the Protocol before the end of 2003 and it is now 2004. The common position adopted on 15 December set the deadline at June 2004 and the Commission made a declaration in this respect, indicating that we would have preferred it to have been ratified before the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its hard work on this issue, given that the Council only sent the Common Position to Parliament a few weeks ago. I of course want Parliament to take up the suggestions of the rapporteur, Mr Gil Robles, whom I thank not only for having conducted the debate on this report and coordinated it with all Members so quickly, but also for the clear manner in which he explains all the points and the importance of this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has just been explained to us, the Convention created a fund to compensate victims of damage and it should be pointed out that it is funded by contributions from the companies or other entities that receive oil transported by sea. Therefore, increasing the maximum sum of compensation from the current EUR 162 million, as this Protocol requests, is not going to be a burden on public funds, but on those who benefit from the oil trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1978, the Fund has been used in more than one hundred cases, and in the majority the limit set was sufficient. However, the Commissioner reminded us that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accidents demonstrated that the limit was now out of date and needed to be increased. Therefore, in March 2003, following the wave of emotion and concern unleashed by the latter of these disasters, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union asked for the Fund to be increased to one billion euros and, in May of that year, the decision was commendably taken on board very rapidly by the Member States of the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Resolution of July 2003, very soon afterwards in the same year, on increasing maritime safety following the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> oil tanker (the report by Mr Sterckx), Parliament was in favour of the decision by the global organisation and called upon the Member States to ratify the relevant Protocol as soon as possible. This was the first time that they were called upon to ratify it quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have been told, the Commission not only acted swiftly, but with clear political commitment, by asking the Council to move on from the very easy promising phase to the fulfilling phase, which is always more difficult. Finally, when the situation was becoming quite embarrassing, it secured the agreement from the Italian Presidency, setting a target date, as long as it was possible, which is what the Commissioner has just explained to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market unanimously adopted the proposal to ratify the Protocol. In fact it would have been enough to issue the assent, but I felt it was essential to stress the request in Recital C of the Decision, that it is important for the Member States to sign or ratify the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I must acknowledge that all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market were on this same wavelength. Why? Because, as long as it is not signed and ratified by those Member States, we will remain in the current situation, in other words, with a fund that is insufficient to cover potential compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore stresses that the Protocol should enter into force. Parliament wanted to make it clear that, from now on, any delay cannot be blamed on or attributed to the Community institutions. It will be the Member States who drag their feet in ratifying the Protocol who will have to face up to their responsibilities. I would like to think that this will not be the case and that they will all ratify it as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all that remains – as my time is running out – is for me to thank the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the support they have given me, this committee and Parliament’s services for their invaluable help, and the Commission for the political support that it has consistently given.</p>
<p class="contents">The report put forward today is necessary and urgent. I therefore trust that you will vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The FIPOL Protocol 2003 extends the maximum amount of cumulative funds available according to the various international agreements to 750 million special drawing rights, which, at the current exchange rate, is equivalent to 930 million euros. These funds are provided by shipowners and companies that receive oil transported by sea, to compensate for environmental disasters and victims of spills caused by accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">One year after the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, however, it is still difficult to assess the damage caused. A new report by the World Wide Fund for Nature shows that 3 000 kilometres of coastline were affected and calculates the damage to be around 5 000 million euros, in other words, five times the FIPOL Protocol for 2003 would be needed to deal with all of the damage caused. We therefore continue to call for a European Fund in addition to all the existing international funds, particularly considering the huge amount of oil traffic on our seas and the existence of areas such as the ‘<span class="italic">Costa da Morte’</span>, or the ‘Coast of Death’ in Galicia, which is one of the places where there have been the most maritime accidents in the past, along with other black spots such as the Calais straits, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to express our dissatisfaction at the deadline for this Protocol to be signed being extended to the end of June 2004, as agreed by the Council and the Member States, rather than retaining the original date of last December. If another accident were to take place during the first six months of this year, the cover would only be around 250 million euros, which is more than concerning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Gil Robles on his report and I hope that the Commission will continue with its proposal for an additional European fund, because it is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I think that both the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, have expressed the substance of this proposal and Mr Ortuondo Larrea has also given various pieces of information that there is no need for me to repeat.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an assent procedure, which means that Parliament has to adopt the decision in order for it to be obligatory and, in this particular case, Parliament has acted quickly, because the letter from the Council requesting the assent is dated 8 January, and tomorrow, 12 February, one month and five days later, Parliament will give its assent. I think that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been exemplary in this respect, because the request was put forward so that we had already appointed Mr Gil-Robles in October, in order that when the Council proposal arrived, we could adopt it quickly. I think this is a good example of interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions, almost <span class="italic">avant la lettre</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of content, Mr Ortuondo has pointed out the fact that there are insufficient resources. For example, in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, we are talking about EUR 5 000 million, which is only one fifth of the amount needed to cover the damage, which is why Mr Ortuondo stressed the need for an additional European fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss other more legal matters, however. Firstly, according to Community law, it is not the Member States who have competence in this field, but the European Union as a whole. The agreed formula is an intelligent one: the Member States signing in the interests of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the legal system can be changed so that the European Community itself will be an actual member in order to avoid situations such as this in which particular Member States, such as Austria and Luxembourg, will not be bound by the agreement until 2005. There is also another quite peculiar situation: Denmark is not bound by this decision and it just so happens that it is one of the Member States that is most exposed to this type of accident, due to the extent of its straits. I wonder whether the Danish people are aware that, as a result of this <span class="italic">opting-out</span>, damage caused in Denmark by this type of incident will not be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, from now on, although the Commission has acted as swiftly and efficiently as possible, it should initiate progress in this respect. This is not an agreement signed by the Member States in the interests of the Community, but an agreement signed by the European Union in the interests of the whole of the European Union: defending national sovereignty does not benefit the citizens of the European Union, which is what we are concerned with.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be a fundamental lesson to learn from this type of agreement. We cannot continue to operate with old instruments from former ages, in which the Member States were acting to defend national interests, when we are dealing with collective interests, such as preserving the environment across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council’s common position has been long overdue. The International Maritime Organisation has, however, decided to raise the limit of existing funds to 750 000 Special Drawing Rights and thus placed the limit virtually at EUR 1 billion, so this addressed the point that this House made in the Esclopé report. We would therefore like to congratulate those Member States that belong to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on this decision. It does justice to reality and gives guarantees for an adequate financial arrangement in the case of oil pollution. This does not detract in any way from the fact that prevention is better than cure. I hope that this elaboration of the liability regulation offers encouragement in this respect. Consequently, the report by our ex-President receives my wholehearted support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, it would be ludicrous to tell the victims of this disaster that, because of the fact that we, Europe as a whole, did not do our duty, they are only going to be compensated for 15% of the damage suffered, because the fund for that purpose only has EUR 170 million available and because unfortunately this increase that we are debating today is not retroactive.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident (we are talking about November 1999) it became clear that the compensation system was inadequate for dealing with this type of disaster, both at international and European level, where such mechanisms were not provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">The IMO decided, a long time before the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> sank, to increase the amount allocated to the FIPOL to compensate victims to EUR 600 million, and in 2000, the Commissioner proposed creating an additional European fund, Compensation for Oil Pollution in European waters (COPE), with a limit of one billion euros. The proposal received the support of the European Parliament, but was rejected by the Council, which opted to negotiate in the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the IMO finally established a new fund, and even set it close to the magic and famous billion figure, that amount will never be able to ensure full and swift compensation for victims of future oil spills, for two reasons. The first was mentioned by Mr Ortuondo Larrea: more than a year after the disaster we are far from succeeding in assessing the full extent of the consequences, not only because the vessel, carrying at least 15 000 tonnes, is still 3 000 metres deep in the Atlantic, but also because the oil is still reaching our coastlines. The second reason is that the rising number of increasingly independent reports calculate the damage caused at a figure that is never less than five billion euros.</p>
<p class="contents">The maximum compensation limits cannot guarantee sufficient protection for potential victims of a large oil slick; this can only be achieved through unlimited liability, including collective damage. Setting a limit on damage is not rational and, above all, it sends a perverse signal to potential polluters.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that only sovereign States can be parties to the Protocol, as has been mentioned here, the Commission proposes that we call upon the Member States to sign or ratify it – sign or ratify the protocol as soon as possible and by July 2004 if possible – in the words of Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, whom I congratulate on his work as rapporteur. Perhaps, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, we will have to get down on our knees, because, from May until now, only two Member States have ratified it and a minimum of eight ratifications are needed in order for it to enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it will be necessary to develop the agreements to extend the circle of liability, which, as we have said many times, should cover all those involved in the transport chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The system of liability under the two international conventions is a multiple system. Apart from subjective liability, which does not operate in practice, we have the objective liability of the shipowner, with compensation capped at EUR 72 million, and the supplementary liability of the fund in the event that the shipowner is unable to pay or the above sum is exceeded, which has been amended from EUR 92 to 250 million. The extensive damage following the accidents involving the <span class="italic">Erika </span>and the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>proved the inadequacy of the compensation provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, in December 2000, efforts were made, following a proposal by the Commission, to set up a European supplementary fund for damage in European waters. This liability would also be supplementary because the obligation to pay compensation would apply if there was no compensation from the funds. Although this proposal was approved by the European Parliament, it was rejected by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">By a happy coincidence, we know that, in May 2003, the protocol for the establishment of the International Fund for Compensation was adopted, with compensation capped at EUR 1 billion. This is again a supplementary fund. Given that no Community rules have been adopted to regulate the question of compensation for damage from oil spills, the Council decision to accede to the protocol must be seen by all of us as a particularly positive action. That is why the European Parliament, without reservations, must give its assent, with Article 200, paragraph 3 of the Treaty as the legal basis. It should be noted that there is exclusive jurisdiction on matters regulated by the protocol for the supplementary fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, there is no clash with Regulation 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, because the protocol is based on the existing regime in the 1992 Convention. It is clarified that this is not accession by the European Union itself, but authorisation to the Member States to ratify the protocol. The rapporteur rightly points out that this must be done as quickly as possible, even before June this year. We hope that, in future negotiations, the possibility will be provided for the Community to become a contracting party to the protocol. There is no such provision today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I entirely agree with Mr Medina that it should be the Commission that is responsible to the International Maritime Organisation, at least for matters in which we have exercised Community competence. The problem is that, as you are well aware, we have not been able to join the Organisation because, among other things, the Council has had the mandate for some time now. It is a proposal that I made nearly two years ago and, unfortunately, the various presidencies that there have been during that time have been very busy with other matters. This is true, but I also think that they should have given some attention to this issue, which they did not do.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Council’s enthusiasm for moving forward in terms of Community presence in the International Maritime Organisation is not across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is happening with another organisation, the International Civil Organisation, but I entirely agree that this is the right approach, particularly when, in this case, competence has been exercised in this field for the past four years, which had not been done before. The competence that the Community has now taken on is much greater and, therefore, it should also be able to defend it at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mrs Miguélez that, as she is well aware, I made a proposal regarding criminal liability, among other things, because there is often a problem of wilful negligence, and not only in cases like those of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> in which it is up to the judges to decide whether or not it is wilful, but also in cases in which bilges are being cleaned unscrupulously and tanks are being cleaned unscrupulously on the high seas, representing 90% of the spillages that take place on our coasts; it is true that they are more diluted, extended over a longer period of time and a larger area, and therefore are less concentrated, but the impact is absolutely disastrous and devastating and, as you are aware, I have proposed that this problem be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier someone, I think it was Mr Ortuondo Larrea, was talking about the European Maritime Safety Agency, and certifying systems to monitor the issue of bilges and emptying tanks and also, in order to combat these types of measures. As you are aware, I believe that we need to act on every front: we need to act through the European Maritime Safety Agency, through monitoring by the port authorities, through the facilities which, it should be remembered, we adopted here, facilities in the ports enabling the vessels to unload and clean bilges and deal with other waste water. This should be done, do not think that we are forgetting, using the latest technology, from satellite photography to every type of system and method available for monitoring the systems installed in the vessels themselves, at the exit points in order to monitor when they leave and whether or not the cleaning has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to act on all fronts because sea pollution is something that we cannot tolerate. The sea does not just belong to all Europeans, but to all of humanity, and we have the responsibility to preserve it for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you especially to Mr Gil Robles for the swiftness with which he prepared this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
