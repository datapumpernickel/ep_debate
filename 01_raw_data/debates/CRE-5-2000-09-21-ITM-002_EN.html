<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, there must be a common and effective EU contribution to the success of the UN World Conference Against Racism next year and its European preparatory conference next month. The EU has a human rights duty and competence to make all different, all equal, a reality. It can and must forcefully tackle race discrimination and xenophobia making the EU a world leader in the celebration of multicultural and ethnic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us do it with wholehearted political conviction, not just as a diplomatic exercise. This question and motion outlines ways in which racism must be documented and prevented and sanctions implemented. Getting effective sanctions means firstly exploiting EU powers for anti-discrimination laws and agreeing the Article 13 Race Directive in record time sent the right signal of determination. Effectiveness also means stepping up intergovernmental police and judicial cooperation under Article 29 of the EU Treaty and ways to do that are explored here.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to hear that the Member States will sign Protocol No 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights which makes discrimination a direct infringement of the convention on the occasion of the convention’s fiftieth anniversary in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Members and Groups with many helpful amendments which I will accept, but there are some I cannot accept. Firstly, I regret that the opportunity has been taken to identify specific countries and parties as especially bad e.g. Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6. The trouble with singling out some countries but not others is that you do not make a comprehensive assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to the sponsors of these amendments to consider withdrawing them. In particular I would appeal to Mr Ford to withdraw his Amendment No 1 even if I have sympathy with it since it would be a pity if a motion on these very important European and world conferences were derailed over Austria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens’ initiatives, various religious denominations and other social groupings have been warning against right-wing extremism for years. It is there in the East and in the West, even though the acts are perpetrated by a minority. In the East, right-wing groups no longer regard themselves as a minority, but believe they hold centre stage in society, and they have cult status among young people. Silence breeds consent right across the social divide, which means there are certain zones in EU cities where the right wing holds sway and not the state.</p>
<p class="contents">There may well be various reasons as to why this is so, e.g. people were brought up in a totalitarian state, many people in the East suffer from a lack of self-esteem, there is high unemployment, and young people feel they have no future prospects, but we must not dwell on these explanations and instead, take action at long last. A Europe founded on the inviolability of human dignity and which guarantees freedom of movement, must take a zero tolerance line with right-wing violence. So it is time to break our silence over the right-wing violence that has become an everyday occurrence in parts of the European Union, even if we stand accused of running down our own countries. We need a tolerant government and the pro-active financial support of local groups and players, and of those who have the courage to stand up for their beliefs. Europe must be seen to fly the flag on this issue. It must provide these groups with outside support, so as to encourage them to continue to stand up for their own convictions against the right wing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The well-known German newspaper ‘Der Tagesspiegel’ records that there have been 93 murders with a right-wing extremist background over the past ten years. Being of DDR origin, the developments in eastern Germany are of course particularly hard for me to bear. There are undoubtedly underlying reasons, stemming from the way society was in the DDR; in particular the after-effects of authoritarian structures and the weakness of civil society in eastern Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are just as many reasons that have to do with the developments that have taken place over the last ten years, for example the dissociation of economic and social development in eastern Germany from that in the former Bundesländer, the lack of respect for East Germans’ curriculum vitaes and their experience, and the lack of rigour in the debate on right-wing extremism past and present. Long-established right-wing extremist parties and organisations are transferring their infrastructure, organisational set-ups and funds from the old Bundesländer to the new Bundesländer on a massive scale.</p>
<p class="contents">The social polarisation of society, state withdrawal from social and educational establishments and the increasingly fierce competition within the labour market, provide a fertile breeding ground for racism and xenophobia. The feeling of helplessness that grips so many people in the face of socially and culturally destructive global competition, and the suppression of politics and democracy in favour of profit-making business interests.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of rhetoric, underpinned by nationalism, which uses immigration as a point of departure for election campaigns, will smooth the way for racism and xenophobia. The European Union’s restrictive immigration and asylum policy, the lack of transparency, and citizens’ involvement, are contributory factors. The first thing we need though, is for there to be rigorous stigmatisation of racist and right-wing extremist views, secondly, the EU and its Member States must make their immigration and asylum policies more acceptance and integration-orientated, thirdly, we need an active employment and social policy, particularly for young people, and fourthly, we need a classical education policy that instils tolerance and considers cultural and ethnic diversity to be enriching. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council and the Presidency attach great importance to the European Conference against racism “All Different, All Equal” which will be held in Strasbourg between 11 and 13 October 2000, in preparation for the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism. In this context, the Presidency is sparing no effort to achieve the utmost cooperation and coordination between the Member States of the European Union in the preparations for the conference in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">There is already very active coordination of efforts between Member States, in addition to the many preparatory meetings which have taken place. At this stage, the Council does not, at this European Conference in Strasbourg, intend to present a position common to the fifteen Member States, according to the terms of Article 34(2). I think it is important, however, that the coordination between the European Union Member States should continue in order to avoid a situation where they are expressing divergent views on the various issues raised. The Council does intend, and I must stress this, to present a common position at the World Conference which is due to be held next year in South Africa, and work on finalising this common position has already been set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to coordinate their positions ready for the European Conference, the Member Sates will, of course, take account of the very useful recommendations given in the document provided by the Commission departments on 17 April.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the resources to be implemented in order to ensure maximum synergy between the work carried out in this area by, on the one hand, the United Nations High Commissioner's Office for Human Rights and, on the other, the Council of Europe’s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, but also the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, I would like to remind Baroness Ludford that, on 21 December 1998, the Council adopted a decision relating to the conclusion of an agreement for the purpose of establishing close cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Monitoring Centre, and that the cooperation between these two institutions has actually been very fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, research is underway into how to establish closer links between the High Commissioner’s Office and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, further, like to point out that on 21 June 2000, the Council directive was adopted, implementing the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Because of the duplication that now exists between this directive and the proposal for a directive on the creation of a general framework promoting equal treatment in employment and work – the directive on discrimination – racial discrimination was withdrawn from its scope, but let me remind you that the scope of this proposal for a directive is a great deal more limited than that of the directive previously adopted, which covers not only the sectors of employment and work but also social protection, welfare benefits and education, as well as access to goods and services and the provision of goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, work on the Community Action Programme to combat discrimination is well underway within the Council and I can safely state today that, if the European Parliament issues its opinion during its first part-session in October, the Council will be in a position to adopt a political agreement on this text on 17 October, so that the text could be adopted before the end of the French Presidency, enabling the programme to be launched, as anticipated, on 1 January 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of the 1996 Joint Action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia, in May 1998 the Council examined a report on Member States’ compliance with the obligations upon them under the Joint Action and decided that the implementation of this Joint Action should be re-examined in 2000. Let me point out that the Presidency is currently making arrangements for this review which will assist the Council in assessing the overall effectiveness of the Joint Action and in ascertaining which features need strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Baroness, that I have given as full an answer as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two monsters in Europe today are terrorism and racism. And these, unfortunately, are the subject of our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">Odysseus overcame both monsters, but he needed ingenuity, persistence and courage. Today, the political, democratic leadership of Europe has to play the role of Odysseus. Sixty years ago, we lived through one of the worst wars in the history of mankind. The idea behind the European Union was to create institutions which would guarantee peace and significant steps were taken in the years which followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the clouds of racism are still hovering over Europe. There are numerous dimensions to the fight against racism at European level. One such dimension is the EU’s basic policy of deepening its policies, i.e. strengthening social cohesion in Europe and ironing out differences, and another is its enlargement policy, i.e. strengthening countries which have problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as anti-racist policies in particular are concerned, I should like to refer to quite specific policies and measures. In 1996, the Council approved a joint action on judicial cooperation between Member States on questions of racism. We are about to enter the second stage of this joint action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam is a really important weapon in Europe’s institutional arsenal. Articles 29 and 13 allow us to adopt quite specific policies. Article 29 allows us to combat racism and xenophobia by cooperating in the area of justice and security, in order to create a single area of freedom and justice. In Tampere, the policy for measures in this sector was evaluated and decided and we are now moving more towards measures relating to this sort of crime via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, two directives have been proposed on the basis of Article 13; the directive on racial discrimination was voted through by the European Parliament and the Council in record time, a mere six months, and is now part of European legislation. The purpose of the second directive is to combat all forms of discrimination in the workplace and this will be debated during the French Presidency. Of course, laws alone are never enough, which is why the Commission has proposed an anti-discrimination programme which allows governments, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to work together on innovative policies and to exchange best practices in the fight against racism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European monitoring centre in Vienna is an important institution, the purpose of which is to provide objective, reliable, comparable data on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and to act as a basic design tool at both European and national level. The monitoring centre has already drawn up studies on the extent of racism and on manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in various Member States, in order to analyse their causes, repercussions and results and has examined examples of good practices which are working in certain Member States. The monitoring centre is setting up a coordinated network of non-governmental organisations and organisations which can work together at European level in order to address questions of xenophobia. Similarly, it can make recommendations to the Community and the Member States in connection with policies which should be pursued and it has already been working with the German Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Strasbourg conference is a very important event. The Commission is also involved from the point of view of theoretical and political proposals. We have already submitted two documents incorporating all the experience and proposals on how to combat racism at Community level, together with our experience in matters of education, training, research and policy for young people in order to address these matters. There is financial support for the conference as regards non-governmental organisations because we believe that they can play an important role, over and above the role of governments and, of course, we are negotiating for support for the involvement of non-governmental organisations in the regional conferences to be held in Chile, Senegal and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we must never forget that the European Union was constructed in order to prevent a recurrence of the racist atrocities which we lived through 60 years ago. Policy is based, at European level, on an institutional arsenal which we strengthened with the Treaty of Amsterdam but in which there is still room for further effort, by creating structures to study and analyse this phenomenon and support governments, by supporting a European network between various agencies so that they can increase public awareness and, of course, by exchanging and supporting national policies on education, the mass media, policies for young people and information at national level. However, we must say, and this is important, that all these policies, this entire philosophy is based on one principle: zero tolerance in Europe towards racism and zero tolerance of the reason for any operation based on racism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is even one of the most appalling human failings, and no one has a monopoly on it. Often, it is the product of fear, ignorance, foolishness and selfishness, but also of institutional cowardice. If a society wishes to call itself truly civilised, it has a duty to track down, prohibit, punish and eradicate racism by means of education and prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe wishes to be a civilised society, and has the opportunity every day to show that it is. Parliament is required to give an opinion on the European Union’s position at the World Conference Against Racism. Our position must be clear, intelligible and specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position must be clear, without going into unnecessary details. Personally, I am all in favour of brief texts. It must be up-to-date, i.e. it must take account of the new means of communications which can also be used as media for the expression of racist views.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position must be intelligible. That is to say, it must be structured around the major key ideas establishing a method: the identification of racism, particularly with the aid of our partners, the NGOs or our own monitoring centres, the punishment of racism, with the idea of zero tolerance and, of course, the prevention of racism.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position must be specific. That is to say, beyond the universal value of the fight against racism, there must be a specifically European message, for, let us be clear about this, Europe has often been the home of racism. We can, moreover, even see the revival of racism in some European Union countries. In such instances we have a duty to remember and a duty to be vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message must be an ambitious one. We must be a role model. As the Commissioner pointed out, we do not lack the resources to combat discrimination or racism in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the first article of which prioritises human dignity. That, I believe, is the reason why the PPE has become involved in framing this text. We want to ensure that it is rid of all the pointlessly contentious dross to do with the current situation and free of any additions which do not contribute to the formulation of the text. In this, as the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament, we have a shared responsibility and we want to be very scrupulous about this common approach, as Europe’s credibility, at this World Conference Against Racism, will depend, above all, on our assessment of the situation and on how credible we are on our own territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we learned of the death, very near to where I live, of another person who worked of his own free will in the world of politics: a local councillor.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that this debate is a timely continuation of this morning’s debate because, as John Hume has so often reminded us in Parliament, all conflicts are linked to the notion of difference, all conflicts focus on what we do not accept in others. John Hume has also reminded us on many occasions in Parliament that the European Union is and must continue to be an example of conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">One could say that the European Union today is the practical expression of the exact opposite to the notions of terrorism and racism. This is why I believe that Europe has to go to the World Conference Against Racism having adopted a strong and common position, a position that has been tried and tested on other occasions, the first of which was the application in the European Union of the United Nations Convention of 1965. However, Mr President, I think there is another, more important issue that we must tackle without delay. We cannot allow the radicals in Spain – in El Ejido – in Italy, Germany or Austria to take the initiative in this field. We must talk to the people of Europe and we must – as has been achieved in the directive against discrimination – make progress on all of the other objectives of the Tampere European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report and let her know that we intend to seriously examine its proposals. We have to accept that these days Europe is a more pluralistic place than it used to be and we must let the world know that we are pleased that this is the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not intend to recount how many times Jewish cemeteries have suffered arson attacks and desecration, or describe to you the various racist attacks that have taken place. Racism in Germany and in Europe constitutes one of the greatest challenges our society has to overcome. Not only does racism put the minorities living amongst us at risk, it also jeopardises the values our societies were founded on after dreadful experiences. The European Union is the product of this development.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only welcome the fact that the United Nations have seized the initiative and will hold a World Conference Against Racism next year. We must make use of this opportunity and make a clear European contribution to this conference. I very much regret that my colleagues from Germany are not present in the Chamber at the moment to join me in sending out the message that racism does not stand a chance, either in Germany or Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We often condemn the perpetrators of such violence. I think it is high time that we pointed the finger at the people who provide the ideological weapons to arm them, the soundbites. As we know, the parties of the extreme right build themselves up by exploiting social problems, job insecurity and unemployment. This is what we must fight, and we must also, where necessary, combat the spineless consensus between traditional political parties, on the left wing as well as the right, which helps gain them more sympathisers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you ought to know, the extreme right gets into power only by exploiting and stressing our weaknesses, the areas we neglect. All those who repeat their words and their ideas are therefore giving them credibility, and all those who think they can moderate them by involving them in public affairs are making them commonplace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to understand the strategy of the parties of the extreme right by looking only at their hatred of foreigners. Instead one must look at their overall social programme, their homophobic utterances, and their anti-cultural attitude. It then becomes clear that their strategy is one of homophobic statements, attacks on culture and on workers’ rights, opposing the right to strike, opposing the self-determination of workers. We should also avoid the situation of women being banished from the world of work due to the establishment of a ‘wage’ for mothers, as we have seen recently. The only possible response is a hardline attitude. We have only succeeded in combating the <span class="italic">Front National</span> effectively in France because we never had any government alliance. In Europe, we must make massive investments in education, prevention and combating job insecurity, and we must reaffirm the fact that non-European residents have the same rights as European residents.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by thanking Commissioner Diamantopoulou for making the comparison between terrorism and racism, because I consider that it is an attack on the physical dignity of persons, and as such is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of tolerance and opposition to hatred versus the Europe of violence and indifference: this is what is at stake at the conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is valuable, although there are some omissions: for example, there is no mention of one form of institutional racism, the denial of the right of self-determination of peoples. Sadly, the European Union has much to learn in this area: it has conferred the status of candidate country on Turkey, which denies this right, in the same way, moreover, that China denies this right to Tibet, and yet the whole world is in favour of improving relations with China for economic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this report, I would like to focus particularly on Amendment No 6 – which I hope will be rejected – which cites the political movement to which I belong as a racist party. Now, there are very strict laws against racism in Italy. The judiciary is by no means lenient towards my political movement: our secretary has been convicted on several occasions and prosecuted a number of times, but never for racism. The party leaders, and I myself, are under investigation on grounds of separatism, which is punishable by imprisonment, but no member of my movement has been either convicted or brought to trial for racism or acts of violence. I therefore do not understand why we are being accused of racism.</p>
<p class="contents">I belong to the Lega Nord, not to Mr Haider’s movement, and I therefore fail to understand why the two should be confused. I reiterate: in Italy, my movement is not currently arraigned on charges of racism and has never been convicted of racism in the past, and I therefore fiercely reject this accusation. The statements of those jokers who persist, year in, year out, in asserting to the contrary, are pure fabrication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, last Friday, the German Lower House discussed adopting a more hard-line approach in order to fight right-wing extremism at home. This was an opportune debate at the appropriate level. The spokesperson of the Greens, and as such a fellow member of the party of Mrs Schroedter, who submitted the oral questions, argued on that occasion that there are no easy solutions for combating right-wing extremism. However, to him, the many initiatives against right-wing extremism from the citizens in the new federal states offer a ray of hope. This Green representative sounds all in all less gloomy and less alarming than his colleague within our own EP ranks.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying that, I have no intention of playing down the genuine concerns of Mrs Schroedter with regard to society’s current aversion to foreigners, if not downright xenophobia in the east of Germany. Considerably more East Germans than West Germans seem to think that too many foreigners are residing within their own territory and even feel exploited by this group. A remarkable state of affairs, given the sobering fact that hardly any foreigners live in East Germany. They make up between 1 and 2.5% of the population over there, according to a recent German press source.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems logical that this paradox is very much playing on the minds of the Germans. It is exactly this crucial factor at home that I miss in Mrs Schroedter’s written introduction to her questions. By way of background to racist violence in the new federal states, she quotes the “dramatically high percentage” of racist attitudes among the population, including the fact that racism is being elevated to “a kind of youth culture”.</p>
<p class="contents">This reasoning immediately brings to mind an obvious follow-up question: why do racism and right-wing extremism thrive within the territory of the former German Socialist state of workers and farmers, the GDR, of all places? Our fellow MEP, André Brie provides a clear and plausible answer to this. The writer of the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine’</span>s leader quoted him approvingly yesterday as saying: ‘One of a number of causes of right-wing violence is definitely to be found in the GDR.’</p>
<p class="contents">The German commentator, Lutz Rathenov, is bringing this viewpoint even more into focus: ‘The GDR used to treat foreigners in a way which right-wing extremists would dream about these days.’ This attitude is, to this day, leaving its mark in the east of the united Germany. According to Rathenov, right-wing extremism cannot be eradicated as a localised and clearly identifiable evil. Instead, a social norm has emerged for which the Federal Republic is ill prepared and for which it is partly to blame. Which West German negotiating partners of the GDR were concerned about the fate of the Vietnamese immigrant workers in East Germany at the time? In the words of Rathenov, did it bother him as a Christian Socialist negotiator, that, in the event of their becoming pregnant, these Vietnamese women were forced to have abortions?</p>
<p class="contents">Overcoming the GDR complex within the Federal Republic, namely the feeling many East Germans have of being second-class citizens, will take time. As an antidote to East German right-radicals, neo-nazis and skinheads, insider Lutz Rathenov is making an interesting proposal: ‘There are places where young people should be sent abroad en masse for a couple of years.’ On a voluntary basis, I think Europe would be prepared to finance this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst those of a left-wing persuasion define their position at a comfortable distance from Stalinism, Communism and left-wing extremism as if it were the most natural thing in the world, they are evidently incapable of recognising the difference between the right, right-wing extremism and fascism. However, those who, as a matter of course, only ever lay responsibility for crimes against humanity at the door of their political opponents, are committing the fatal error of simply using those very crimes to absolve themselves of all blame. No one in this House becomes an anti-fascist by denouncing their political opponents as fascists. One cannot escape one’s own history and one’s own responsibility that easily.</p>

Quite simply, it is about the difficult task of finding a position which the European Union, i.e. the European Parliament, can agree on as regards a strategy for dealing with racism, and then representing this position at the world conference. The Commissioner has made constructive proposals on a sensitive issue, as has the author of the motion for a resolution, Mrs Ludford, and we will support them in this. But this debate should never be misused for other purposes. I am sorry to say that certain delegates have repeatedly done exactly that; for example there is one who only makes reference to one region in the fight against racism, thereby giving an exaggerated impression of the problems which exist on a European and worldwide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ford defamed my country, Austria, in his statement. He told me he had not read the Wise Men’s report, but that did not stop him from writing in his statement, with reference to the report of the Three Wise Men, that the problems of racism and xenophobia would endure. Had he read the report, he would have found that that is patently untrue. There are no problems there of the kind he describes. On the contrary, the report registers a very positive response to the government, because it is pursuing successful counter-strategies, some of which go beyond the standards set by other EU countries. I have here motions for resolutions that call, in general terms, for budgetary lines to be increased, without saying to what end, and without specifying which activities are to be the beneficiaries of this funding. Some of the demands are excessive, such as those calling for the level of immigration to be increased, and for illegal entrants to the Union to be placed on an equal legal footing. These are all things that work people into a state of panic, given the sensitivity of the issue. What we really need is a plan for tackling the root causes, immigration policy strategies that take account of integration capacity, and of an individual Member State’s absorption capacity, also strategies leading to a common asylum policy which help refugees whilst tackling abuse, and measures promoting integration.</p>

It is true that being on the left does not make you proof against a fascist mindset. History has borne this out. Therefore it is absolutely true that the left must reflect on their past too, as must the right. But the object of the exercise today is for the democrats to give thought to the tasks they face here and now. The task facing the democratic parties at present, be they in East Germany, in your country, in Italy or in Spain – El Ejido to name but one – is how to actually mobilise the silent majority of people who stand idly by and watch as defenceless, helpless people are driven through the streets and murdered. How do we mobilise this majority? The question we must ask ourselves is this, ‘Why are five thousand people in my homeland – which is North Rhine Westphalia in Germany – prepared to take to the streets in protest against a decree on fighting dogs, but only 300 turn out to protest against right-wing extremism?’ That is the question we must ask ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you something, Mr Sichrovsky, you represent the Freedom Party. People who criticise your party are not disparaging Austria as a whole. I respect the Austrian people but I despise the racists in your party – let there be no mistake about that – of whom you are one.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to you, Mr Pirker, in every sense. Therefore, to recap: the point of these oral questions, and the statements made by Mrs Ludford, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs Kaufmann, is not to single out any old region in Europe and say ‘that is where things are at their worst’. We German delegates, coming as we do from a land notorious for its perpetrators of fascism, always find it hard to bear that something like this is going on in our country, of all places. But anyone who believes that fascism is a German phenomenon inevitably plays down the fact that the problem is endemic to Europe. Therefore I say again: this is a European battle.</p>

Which is worse?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has no trouble appeasing its conscience on this matter, making solemn declarations and financing useless initiatives and monitoring centres. But racism should be fought by basing our societies on rights and freedoms, whereas Europe is growing into an anti-democratic, prohibitionist society which is repressive in all areas, with the result that it has become fearful to the point that it even wants to ban opinions and parties. This is the road to ruin. In the United States of America, where, in 2050, whites will be in a minority, there is an American Nazi party and there is a candidate for the American presidential elections from the Nazi party, but no one thinks of banning it, no one is afraid, because the weapons of democracy and freedom are being used to combat racism. This is how racism must be fought, and this is how we must fight it in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The past few months in particular have seen a whole spate of racially motivated criminal acts in Germany. The events that took place in Dessau, Munich, Ludwigshafen, Düsseldorf are of such concern to us primarily because violent acts were committed against defenceless people with great indifference and coldbloodedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the crimes were committed in all these different places, however, shows that racism and right-wing extremism are not problems specific to East Germany, but are to be found throughout Germany, indeed throughout Europe. It does not help matters though, Mrs Schroedter and also Mr Schulz, to want to concentrate on tackling this problem in the new German Länder, singling these regions out for attention. It is true that the propaganda peddled by these groups, which have long been active in the old Länder, has, I regret to say, fallen on fertile ground in the new Länder in recent years, and that we undoubtedly need to take appropriate action. But hysteria makes for a poor counsellor. What we need is to show a united front in the fight against violence, but also to have faith and confidence in the ability of state and society to rid us of this monster.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in no one’s interests to assert that over 10% of people in the new Bundesländer are of a racist disposition, or to disparage them as such. 16 million citizens cannot, and will not, allow themselves to be labelled as such all because of the activities of an extremist minority. Our citizens have done nothing to deserve this, and nor, more to the point, have our young people, the vast majority of whom are tolerant and open-minded.</p>
<p class="contents">I would expressly like to draw attention to the various actions undertaken by the inhabitants of the new Bundesländer over the past few weeks and months, which have demonstrated repeatedly that they feel a great deal of solidarity with the victims of these crimes, and that we will not tolerate xenophobic machinations and acts of violence in our country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say to Mr Pirker that I have been interested in what has been happening in Austria for some time. I was there in 1986 protesting about Mr Haider’s discrimination against the Slovene speaking minority in Corinthia.</p>
<p class="contents">While I accept, of course, that individual members of the Freedom Party may well be impeccable and upstanding individuals, there is a phrase that those that lie down with dogs get fleas. So it may be unfortunate that some people who have chosen particular political parties get labelled in that way but it is their own ultimate responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report. She has put a great deal of work into it. I have to say, however, and it is not her fault, that there are sins of omission as far as I am concerned. Commissioner Diamantopoulou made the point very clearly that there are two monsters facing us here in Europe, terrorism and racism. We have to recognise that those monsters exist and I am not sure that we do in this particular resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a view that there is not really any racism in Europe. If there is any racism, it is fairly small and, if it does exist, it is the fault of the victims. I reject that. We have had in East Germany the assassination of a Mozambique man, attacks on migrant workers in Spain, an attack on a Jewish professor in Italy, and the continued rise of racism within football that was presented to us yesterday by those people who are campaigning around the “ Show racism the red card” slogan.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the recent condemnation of a terrorist bomber in the United Kingdom, David Copeland, who killed gay people and non-gay people in a gay bar and, of course, we have had the effective sacking of Professor Pelinka from the Observatory by the Austrian Government.</p>

I have seen often enough how right-wing extremists have harassed – or attempted to harass – foreigners, or even those who hold different beliefs. But I have also seen the other side, and how courageous men and women have defended themselves. It is wrong to picture East Germany as being predominantly right-wing extremist in its leanings. The vast majority of people are open-minded and tolerant, and an ever-increasing number of them are prepared to nail their colours to the mast. I believe it is also wrong to maintain that the young people are right-wing extremists. The issue is more complex than that, for although, Mrs Schroedter, it may be precisely these young people that grab the headlines, they do live with their parents and exist within a social sphere. In other words, if we want to solve this problem then we must do more to educate them politically and to communicate values to them, and more still to encourage them to stand up for their beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few weeks, the German Government has made an additional DM 70 million available for just such projects. I feel that is a very important sign. Likewise, for me personally, the fact that consideration is being given to banning the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) sends out a very important social signal. We Germans will not submit to being terrorised by a minority. It is our democracy that is being put to the test here. Speaking as a European, I beseech you not to write East Germany off as a region. I myself, together with many other people throughout Germany, condemn right-wing extremism and xenophobia, and we need the support of the rest of Europe in our fight against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, whether some of us like it or not, Europe is already a multiracial and multicultural continent and no racist is going to stop people intermingling and intermarrying. Unfortunately, the ideologies to which millions of human lives were sacrificed are again taking centre stage. In fact, today, they are even worse, because apart from the basic racist ideology, they include religion and culture and propagandise racial, linguistic and religious purity together with genuine cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The sad thing is that the proponents of racial violence are young people up to the age of 20, most of whom have not completed their education or who do not have a profession. The package of measures which Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already presented is, in my view, an integrated proposal and may provide a convincing response to the racism and xenophobia which we are witnessing today in the European Union. That the state and political leaders have a responsibility goes without saying. However, the media still have an important role to play by promoting the variety and richness of contemporary multiracial and multicultural society and, instead of dramatising and distinguishing crime by immigrants from crime in general, could present the positive contribution made by immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take immediate action to include the consequences of and the fight against racism in school curricula and in teacher training courses. We also need to mobilise political circles in the way suggested by the Commissioner and other honourable Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
