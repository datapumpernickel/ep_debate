Their anger is perfectly legitimate: the defendant was released on a technicality despite the extremely serious charges against him, charges of genocide. Going beyond this particular episode which the Rwandans see as traumatic, what is involved here is the culture of impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clearly established that all those who committed crimes as heinous as genocide or crimes against humanity, or who were accomplices to these, will be pursued tirelessly. In order to do so, international institutions, and that includes ourselves, must provide the international courts with sufficient resources to accomplish its task.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the European Union be prepared, Mr Lamy, to play a role in this regard, in order to, in future, prevent this type of blunder which is catastrophic in the opinion of the populations who are waiting for truth and justice?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, being particularly attentive, of course, to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, so that the duty to remember this conflict which already seems far off, some people think too far off, is maintained, it is the role of the European Union, I feel, to stand by the people of Rwanda on this occasion. A people that has today been truly betrayed by the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, who was, need one be reminded, the founder of hate radio, the notorious <span class="italic">Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines</span> (RTLM). The reaction of the Kigali authorities is understandable, but I invite them to resume their cooperation with the ICTR which is still, in spite of everything, the best instrument to establish justice and, hence, peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for the international justice system to regain control if it wishes to ensure its own credibility, but we must also give it the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions. This is the price of what we owe to the memory of the Rwandans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We asked for an inquiry to take place following a general resolution; this was originally to be an independent inquiry. A Burundi representative, however, lodged objections and after that, we had to use the term “inquiry”. </p>
<p class="contents">Well, in this resolution, we mention an independent inquiry, and this enables us to make it clear that we would like not just the parties involved, so not just the Burundian government, to give their opinion but we would also like to see the actual facts surface. </p>
<p class="contents">We would appreciate it if the Commission could ensure that its EU ambassadors in the region could collate information on this matter and duly inform us. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the fact that the conflict in question is far more extensive. Since 1993, some 200,000 have been killed and 800,000 displaced. Sometimes it is good to quote these figures, because in the light of what is happening on our doorstep in Kosovo, we sometimes forget that a conflict of such dimensions is still taking place in an area of Central Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">It remains an urgent requirement to promote a stability pact using all contacts we have through the European Commission’s links with the United Nations and to promote the political awareness and energy of those who work there, so as to arrive at a stability pact. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope we succeed in sending out a clear message from within Europe that human rights cannot and should not be split up, and that we do not only attach importance to them in relation to Kosovo, but also where this Central-African region is concerned. I hope that both resolutions go some way towards achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday we were deploring genocide and violations of human rights. Today, indeed, we can only be outraged at the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, supposedly for technical reasons, even though he was one of the most significant parties in the incitement to genocide. His release, indeed, is quite symptomatic of the lack of will to make an evaluation of the genocide and, more especially, of the wish to hush up the involvement of European countries, particularly France, where a recent parliamentary inquiry revealed complicity that was, at the best, passive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also stress that the Rwandan situation, as worrying as it is, more particularly affects the stability of neighbouring countries, and the situation in the Congo is quite tragic from this point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential today for the European Parliament to assert clearly that, in order to ensure stability in this region, the conditions must be created for a peace which is based on justice and the prosecution of those responsible for ethnic violence.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are asking the ICTR to review its position regarding Mr Barayagwiza’s release, in consideration of the seriousness of the charges against him. Without some action of this sort, the populations of Rwanda are likely to feel they have been wronged and ethnic conflict is likely to start up again with renewed vigour. We also ask the Rwandan government to resume its relations with the ICTR. This is why it is essential to put an end to the conditions of impunity which are prevailing in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wait until a white person is murdered before we take renewed interest in a conflict in Burundi that has taken so many thousands of people into their graves. I would also like to mention the camps which, in Dutch, we refer to as <span class="italic">“hergroepingskampen</span>” (regrouping camps). This term stands for concentration camps, this is what they really are. In these camps, they section people off based on their ethnic origin so as to facilitate covert genocide. I would therefore urge that the European Union take the situation in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo a great deal more seriously. This week, I heard the advisor of the Council, the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, and I hope that we will be able, at some stage, to help create for others the stability that we want for ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Genocide in any country is evil and must be condemned without reservation. Whoever is responsible for such genocide must be indicted, and justice must be seen to be done. There cannot be any immunity for anyone from such prosecution. The International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha must do its work efficiently, and we hope that those doing this work will take measures to bring this process to a just and speedy end.</p>
<p class="contents">Only four trials have been completed in five years, and this delay has allowed some perpetrators of genocide to go free on technicalities. This is not acceptable. We need to evaluate the work of the tribunal to identify the weaknesses so that we can furnish appropriate assistance to ensure high standards of justice without wasting time and resources. The innocent victims of genocide and conflict cannot wait for ever to rebuild their lives in order to live in peace in their own villages and in their own homes.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution, agreed by all political groups in this Parliament, expresses clearly our concerns, hopes and expectations. It is now up to the government of Rwanda and those of neighbouring countries to take serious action to bring about genuine peace in the area. They need to cooperate fully with the EU special envoy, the EU, the United Nations, the OAU and all humanitarian aid agencies in doing what is needed to support peace and stability in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because the Member States apparently cannot agree on how to tackle the crisis in the Great Lakes Region, we leave Burundi to African countries, some of which are involved in the crisis. We link our aid to the Arusha peace process where Tanzania acts as mediator but at the same time condone the fact that rebels carry out attacks on Burundi from the same country. We refuse to cooperate for fundamental reasons with a government that has managed nonetheless to acquire Parliament’s support. </p>
<p class="contents">The question is very much whether, in this way, we are not playing into the hands of the extremists, both amongst the rebels and within the army. Do we want Hutu extremist movements to seize power in Burundi and commit renewed genocide on a minority? Or are we waiting for a new coup and Tutsi extremists from the army to start renewed cleansing? If we do not want this, let us then give our full support to the peace process in Burundi. Let us bring the moderate parties round the table and isolate the extremists. Let us give unconditional aid to the population and kick-start the economy. Let us finally take Burundi’s problem seriously. In any case, we will never be able to say: we did not know. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We took some pride in the fact that this Tribunal was set up at all – with our assistance too – whether it was adequate is a more complicated matter – in order to clear up these inhuman crimes and to punish the respective perpetrators. As an initial reaction, this attitude of the Rwandan government is even understandable, but the conclusion that it drew from it, i.e. now to refuse further cooperation with this Tribunal, is entirely the wrong one. We cannot understand – and I express myself carefully here – that the presumed architect of the genocide, Barayagwiza, on the basis of procedural issues – and this is hard to swallow – was released and not brought before the court at all. He was, after all, the political director in the foreign ministry of a regime that was responsible for the deaths of 800 000 people – we should really say for the slaughter of 800 000 people. This person, who has now been released, was a leading official in the state radio at the very time when the radio was urging and inciting people on to racial hatred.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group has a two-fold demand: on the one hand to the Rwanda government, to cancel its decision and on the other hand to the Tribunal to revise this decision. In particular, it is not acceptable that the Tribunal refer to the fact that a further charge in the same case is inadmissible owing to the “not guilty” verdict. For charges of this kind there can be no immunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I shall take the statements that I must answer in order, first on the subject of Rwanda, then Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Rwanda is concerned, the Commission shares the concerns which have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the system of justice, if I may use this diplomatic term, to judge those responsible for genocide. No national reconciliation is possible without proper court procedures, and that involves both the Rwandan national justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Mrs Ries, regarding the Rwandan national system of justice, the Commission targeted its interventions at institutional support to the government departments in the area of reinforcement of defence rights and civil cases, in the area of improving living standards in prisons and in the area of support for the survivors of genocide, as well as in the area of respect for human rights. Nonetheless, there are still 130,000 prisoners in prison, accused of crimes related to genocide, awaiting trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rwandan Government is looking for alternative formulae which do not leave room for impunity, and which go in the direction we would like. It is working on defining a system of courts of arbitration along the lines of traditional practice, where the courts are made up of citizens elected to the various levels of local administration, and they would be established to judge three categories of defendant: firstly, ordinary murderers, secondly, those who assaulted but did not kill, and thirdly, finally, the looters, leaving the instigators and ideologists of the genocide and massacres to be judged effectively by ordinary courts, which must be organised in some way to be able to take on this task.</p>
<p class="contents">With the other backers, the Commission is currently assessing the opportunities and methods to contribute to the establishment of this system within the framework of our cooperation. As far as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is concerned, the Commission allocated finance from the very creation of this tribunal, totalling EUR 1.5 million to date. The Commission is going to initiate an evaluation of human rights programmes in developing countries. Particular attention will be paid to the countries or projects we have supported, such as the one I have just mentioned. This evaluation will include support for the International Criminal Tribunal and its conclusions will enable us to identify any new support according to the methods we shall assess in the light of this investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Burundi is concerned, we, too, are extremely concerned at the situation of increasing violence in this country. What are we doing in response to this? I know and I can see that it is always ridiculous to cite aid figures in the face of such calamities. I nonetheless believe that these are the only real proof we can offer to show what we are doing to act on these concerns of yours. The real criticism you might make, which would hit home, is that we are passive in this type of situation. I believe we are not being passive in this particular instance. I should like to give you some examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have supported the peace process by financing the talks taking place in Arusha, with a contribution of EUR 2 million, which is far from being the largest contribution and which should, along with other external finance, be sufficient for the successful conclusion of these talks. It is true that the passing of the facilitator, ex-President Nyerere, is one more obstacle to add to the complexity of the process itself. We think that it is essential for the talks to continue while seeking a new facilitator at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">The intensification of the confrontations, in recent months, has given rise to the displacement of some tens of thousands of people who have, in effect, as has been mentioned in this debate, been forcibly detained in camps by the government since last July. We intervened immediately to provide humanitarian aid, with aid of more than EUR one million over three operations, and we are prepared to continue to intervene in order to meet the most urgent needs next year. The total ECHO contribution to Burundi reached around EUR 10 million this year. At a meeting in New York at the start of the year, the backers of Burundi decided to contribute towards improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of the population and to target their support at the rehousing of displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of these positions, the Commission approved a redevelopment programme of around EUR 50 million, which may be implemented according to the security conditions in the country. We feel that the complete resumption of cooperation is linked to the results of the peace process, and to the establishment of a political and constitutional framework which will lead, finally, to democratisation. This is the answer which I wished to give you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
