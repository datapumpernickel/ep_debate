<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">–</span></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Employment results today constitute a key element of the principal objective of Lisbon, set in 2000. As you surely know, this objective is the following. I quote: ‘making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’. We must not forget that Europe has already made considerable progress as we have created six million jobs on the European continent since 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, it is clear that, despite this progress, Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective: to reach an employment rate of 67% by 2005. Today, a major French newspaper used the headline ‘Europe’s growth at a standstill’, growth that will only reach 1.7%. This is the reason why, faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down, we must bring everything into play, and it is the duty of the European Union to react.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that Mr Wim Kok’s report was produced. This report stressed that there was an urgent need for practical action, by putting in place some decisive measures on a fiscal, social, environmental, research and innovation level in order particularly, in all areas, to create jobs, taking into account, of course, globalisation and the problems linked to the ageing of the population. This requires to a great extent a rapid reaction and good management of the change. This is why we have a duty to choose this change in order not to be subjected to it. This is why, in my report, I wished to insist on the practical implementation of the employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is advisable to improve the reaction capacity of businesses and their employees. This requires an adaptation through an increase in levels of human capital and a policy of life-long training, which should be encouraged. This also requires active encouragement of the creation of businesses, particularly small businesses. It is in this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 7 of the report) that Europe must support networks and partnerships, for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses, research centres, universities and private businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is cause to mobilise the working population, indeed the entire population. In this spirit, I recommend (this is the subject of Amendment 5) making the employment of young people a great European cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is advisable to launch a huge European plan against de-industrialisation. In this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 6), it is certainly important that the European Union support the most disadvantaged regions without neglecting the development of the most dynamic areas. This is the subject of Amendment 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, very specific guidance, intended to improve governance. This is, in fact, the conclusion of the Wim Kok report. Improved governance, meaning the need to mobilise all of the players – national parliaments, regional and local players, social partners, trade unions and associations, but also businesses – and also to facilitate, in this spirit, improved access to the structural funds. Until now, Europe has supported the policies of the Member States, but in a spirit of assistance, by adopting a policy of what I would like to call assistance in the form of a crutch, but not in a spirit of economic dynamism. I think that if it is advisable to keep in mind the need to support the most disadvantaged regions, Europe must both show overtly, and demonstrate, to the outside world its ability to be dynamic. Community financing policy must be established in this spirit of economic dynamism. This is very specifically what I would like to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, I am sorry that, following the votes that took place yesterday, which were on such important issues as the environmental life cycle, tyres, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée – all votes of great consequence – we are obliged to discuss employment policy now, and, moreover, without the Council. I am sorry about the conditions under which we have had to produce this report, given the ambiguity that surrounds it. Indeed, you are producing a report on the guidelines, a legislative report, but you cannot amend it because the guidelines have been fixed for the past three years, as if the environmental context, the international, sociological, financial and fiscal context of this matter, were not changing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We think it right that we should be doing as we now are and considering these broad economic policy guidelines not merely over a year, but over a longer period. That does not, however, mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see very clearly that the European economy is continuing to lose its strength, and that, within the eurozone, recovery, where it has occurred or has had a beneficial influence on growth, is primarily attributable to a steep rise in exports, while domestic demand has sunk as a result of low levels of private consumption over several quarters. That must surely give us cause for concern, and so we want to consider and reformulate these broad economic policy guidelines in such a way as to stimulate economic growth and enable it to become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms. Only if all the Member States keep to what has been agreed will this be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now reiterate Parliament’s criticism to the effect that many Member States are not keeping to their commitment on the Lisbon strategy of combining and bundling all measures aimed at creating truly sustainable growth and also enhancing competitiveness. This is why I believe that the policy guidelines must be targeted even more than before at stimulating economic growth by way of investment and job creation, thus bringing about a rise in productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Growth Initiative, with this as its end, is surely to be welcomed, the guidelines should also express in clear and definite terms a concentration on human resources, research and development, and innovation, as well as on an industry policy that particularly prioritises small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and environmentally-friendly technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the environmental technologies action plan must be implemented, we must not forget the need to invest in social infrastructure, for there will be no increase in productivity if we do not make work and family more compatible and thereby increase the number of women in work. This I do regard as a very important measure; it cannot be too much stressed that this is an area in which many Member States must make much more of an effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the funding of growth-promoting investments any more adequate, and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion. Indeed, the spending envisaged in the present Quick Start programme and in the Growth Initiative will take us no further than that, as all the economic research institutions are of course right to state that no investment under 1% of gross domestic product will have the desired effect, in particular, the positive effect hoped for on the vast mass of people in the European Union – over 14 million of them – who are unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad economic policy guidelines must continue to focus on social and regional cohesion and on convergence in real terms, but there must be greater clarity as to which policy mix will actually prove successful, as we need strong synergy effects between, on the one hand, the necessary structural reforms and, on the other, investment and macro-economic policies aimed at stability and growth. This, of course, is where intelligent use of a more flexible Stability and Growth Pact is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and participative implementation of the Lisbon strategy are not just lofty ideals; these approaches really do promise a great deal in terms of using reform partnerships as a means of implementing the Lisbon strategy. It is my belief that such partnerships for change must concern themselves with economic, social and environmental issues across the board if the Lisbon strategy is to be improved and moulded into a more political form.</p>
<p class="contents">Affirming, as I do, the spirit of Lisbon, I believe that this is the most comprehensive strategy for the purpose of mastering the problems of the European Union, but we must, of course, respond to economic change by updating these guidelines every year, which, as we can see, is becoming more and more necessary. Any reform of the structural funds must also take into account the importance of forging a link between the economic policy guidelines and the structural funds and the use made of them. Moreover, the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This debate is being held in response to the update of the broad economic policy guidelines and the Commission's 2004 report on the employment strategy. I should like to congratulate in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mrs Hermange on their reports. The adoption by the Commission of the so-called package of guidelines, a package which jointly covers the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies, is proof yet again that streamlining bears fruit. Streamlining has resulted not only in the update of the economic policy and employment policy coordination circuits of the European Union, but also in stronger complementarity and cohesion between these two basic procedures. The core objective of streamlining, of coordination of the policies, was to increase their efficiency, by placing more emphasis on application than on the annual drafting of guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies were adopted with a three-year perspective. It was clear right from the outset that the guidelines must be amended only in order to take account of important developments. Within this framework, as there are no important developments, the three-year guidelines must remain stable this year. By maintaining a stable strategy, we shall be able to improve how we project and forecast the impact of European Union policies and ensure that they continue and are efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines. The Commission considers that the overall political strategy laid down in these guidelines continues to apply. Emphasis was placed in the 2004 update on incorporating the 10 new countries within the framework of the coordination of our policies. I should like to comment in greater detail on these two aspects, taking account also of certain comments made in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has confirmed the Community's medium-term strategic economic policy laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003-2005. This strategy has three main axes: macro-economic policies predicated on development and stability, economic reforms to increase development potential and policies to reinforce sustainability. This package of policies focuses on the contribution which economic policies can make towards achieving the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for continuing the existing strategy and for achieving progress are obvious. First, economic developments are in keeping with the expectations which applied when the Council issued the present broad economic policy guidelines last year. As stated in our new economic forecasts, the economies of the European Union are in the process of recovery, which is expected to consolidate. Of course, I have taken note of what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier about concerns about recovery and growth and Mrs Hermange's comments in today's publication about the stagnation in the economy and growth. In all events, the general framework of macro-economic policy is not negative. I should like – and I think that we must – emphasise that we need to take pains to give new impetus to financial restructuring once the recovery has progressed and we must not make mistakes, as has happened on previous occasions when the short-term economy has been sound.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to strengthen both potential growth and the endurance of the economy, decisive application of the objectives we have set for structural reforms is required. In the first evaluation of the application of the present broad guidelines in January, the Commission recognised that some progress had been made. It did, however, also become clear that more progress with the reforms is needed in order not to jeopardise the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. The 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines focuses on integrating the new Member States within the framework of the coordination of our economic policies. It is positive that in Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and in the motion for a resolution you express your support for this objective. The economic challenges which the new Member States face do not differ materially from those which the current Member States face, they are just bigger.</p>
<p class="contents">Our medium-term economic strategy is in a position to address the challenges of the acceding countries. The synergy created from the interaction of macro-economic policies and the necessary structural reforms will result in gradual <span class="italic">de facto </span>convergence between these countries. This – gradual <span class="italic">de facto </span>convergence – is the most important challenge which the acceding countries face.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the 2004 guidelines for employment policies are concerned, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, for the dynamic way in which they prepared the European Parliament's opinion on the guidelines. It is very positive that the issues addressed in the report all relate to the four basic policy sectors, as set out by the European Employment Task Force and in the 2004 joint report on employment, which were confirmed by the spring European Council, namely: improving the adaptability of workers and businesses, attracting more people to the work place, improving the quality of employment and investing in human resources. I consequently consider that, materially, we are on the same wavelength, we have the same concerns and the same priorities for action in coming years. It is also important that you emphasised the need for stricter assessment of the performance of the Member States, in order to give impetus to the application of the strategy on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer very briefly to the Commission proposal for the 2004 guidelines for employment. The Commission proposes maintaining the guidelines as adopted by decision of the Council last July. As part of our joint efforts to streamline the economic policy and employment policy circuits of the European Union, the guidelines for employment policies, like the broad economic policy guidelines, follow a three-year cycle. The reform of the policy on employment carried out last year aimed to address better the basic challenges of the job market in the European Union, in order to respond to the Lisbon objectives for 2010. This reform emphasised the medium-term approach and the definition of a framework policy which would take account of the diversity which prevails in the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint report on employment on which the European Employment Task Force under the chairmanship of Mr Kok agreed, highlighted the need to emphasise the monitoring of the reforms which the Member States undertook to implement, rather than becoming involved in a procedure of further amendments to the guidelines. Similarly, the spring European Council confirmed the need identified in the joint report on employment for the procedure on employment to focus the following year on evaluating progress. The main issue in the next joint report on employment must therefore be the Member States' response to the special recommendations for each country. This means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the Member States, both the current fifteen and the new Member States, in the autumn of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I assure you that the European Commission expresses its satisfaction with the constructive approach by the European Parliament, which has focused its amendments on the recitals. The European Commission, during further negotiations with the Council, will also take account of and will support those amendments which improve certain recitals. I am absolutely convinced that the immense challenge which we face in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives by 2010 makes it necessary for us to focus 100% on application, by translating the challenges into political action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Hermange has the correct approach: we are not seeking to amend the detail of the structure of the guidelines. When we agreed to the streamlining of the economic and employment guidelines last year, we implicitly agreed not to unpack the guidelines themselves until 2006 – the mid-point. That is the right approach: we need that stability in the guideline structure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must acknowledge that we need to focus ever more upon the implementation of both the economic guidelines and in particular, perhaps, the employment guidelines. The problem lies there: Member States are not implementing the guidelines properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation. For example, Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development. With the streamlining of the broad economic and employment guidelines we have every right to expect a comprehensive European framework for investment in lifelong learning, research and development and infrastructure to create a European Union engine for growth and to transform that growth into full and better employment and more social cohesion. That is what the Lisbon process is about and we are falling far short of that at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Amendment 2 we focus on a couple of issues highlighted by the Employment Task Force – the Kok report – namely adaptability and lifelong learning. They are there in the employment guidelines. However, we must acknowledge that in all the national plans, to a greater or lesser extent, there are failures in achieving the targets laid down in those respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 3 concerns taking possession of the delivery of guidelines by national parliaments, social partners, NGOs, and local and regional authorities. We need to encourage those tiers of government to take possession of the guidelines and ensure their proper implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome Mrs Hermange's Amendment 6 on better harnessing of the structural funds for delivery of the guidelines. I also welcome Amendment 7 to encourage companies to better anticipate economic, technical and industrial change. Throughout this mandate, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has insisted on a proactive approach to the management of industrial change. She is right to make that call.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know that Mr Bushill-Matthews intends to table an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce. We would be happy to accept such an amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish in particular to recognise Mrs Randzio-Plath’s solid work on this report. She has also done some sterling work for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Your chairmanship, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has been characterised by impartiality, knowledge and professionalism. I am quite sure that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will miss you. Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU economy still suffers major problems. Overall growth has not achieved the rate we had desired and expected. Even if the American economy is improving all the time, many problems remain. The double deficit and the political uncertainty are undermining economic strength. Nor is growth in the eurozone impressive. We are well aware of the current figures.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the EU of the Fifteen, it emerges that the countries concerned have greater economic strength, with growth of 2% this year and 2.4% next year. Things are significantly better in the new Member States, with growth of 3.5% this year and, on average, 4% next year. Those are figures we can virtually only dream about in the EU of the Fifteen. We know that the changes in the new Member States have been very far-reaching and often painful. The trend is manifestly in the right direction, even if a number of objections may be raised and caution recommended in the manner, for example, of today’s statement by the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU of the Fifteen should be able to learn more from the new Member States with a view to giving impetus to the economy. The competition and the increasing market that is now opening up are to everyone’s advantage. Instead of criticising countries like Slovakia and Estonia which have reduced their taxes and in that way created room for growth, we should see what we can learn from their having done this. Above all, it would be devastating if, in an attempt to standardise and direct the national economies, the EU were to force the new countries to introduce tax increases and extensive welfare reforms at a rate that they themselves are not in favour of. Certainly, competition will become tougher. It has done so already. Corporation tax in the new Member States is lower than in our own countries, but healthy competition is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a need for structural reforms in quite a few of the Member States. We know who the sinners are, and the list of these will unfortunately become longer. The Netherlands and Great Britain are next to be added. Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, we think that this has operated well. It is already flexible. Certainly, the rules can be reviewed, but <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda.</span></p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals believe that Europe can extricate itself from these economic problems but, if it is to do so, more must be done. The Lisbon process must be implemented in full. The Liberal recipe for enabling the EU Member States to obtain growth and more jobs involves sound public finances, increased competition, completion of the internal market in all its aspects and structural reforms for the future. We shall not support the extra amendments in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report, but we are prepared to support the rapporteur’s balanced assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we face huge challenges in Europe, but the opportunities in the new Europe are so much greater. Peace, freedom, democracy and social and economic stability now dominate Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Randzio-Plath’s excellent report documents how dreadfully bad matters look. That applies particularly to Europe and not to the whole world. It must therefore have something to do with specifically European conditions. I am among those who believe that it has to do with the Stability and Growth Pact and with the policy linked to the Stability and Growth Pact. As long as the pact prevails, there is little help to be found. We have a low level of investment and a lack of growth and dynamism, meaning in actual fact that we have a surplus of capital. This capital then has to leave Europe in order to find more profitable investment opportunities. We also have a tragic surplus of labour in the form of people who are unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe we can break this pattern unless we also abandon the Stability and Growth Pact and, instead, begin to think in terms of public investment as practised in the Keynesian tradition. It is nowadays forbidden to talk about Keynes, but I think it incredibly important to begin to debate Keynes and post-Keynesianism. The fact that this is not being done must be due to a kind of ideological block. I cannot see how it could be otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Our having a sound employment policy does not help much as long as those with education and qualifications are not given jobs. Companies do not want them. We need to pin our hopes on public investment. I believe, above all, that we are concerned here not only with infrastructure but also, to a large extent, with the consumption of public services. This needs to be increased. I also believe – and this is another matter that is not allowed to be discussed – that there is a place for reducing working hours in order to get more people into work. We should then obtain a better balance and be able to increase work productivity. Such measures are needed if we are to get anywhere, but as long as neo-liberal politics dominates, matters will, unfortunately, continue to go badly for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, at the end of this legislature, it is time to briefly take stock of economic policy in the European Union. Economic policy includes a Lisbon agenda whose philosophy we could certainly share, but whose implementation is, in fact, deeply unbalanced, since it concentrates on the liberalisation of the sectors and neglects the social and environmental objectives included in the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another part that is definitely lacking, and this is macroeconomic policy at European Union level, which, if it exists at all, does so only through a Stability and Growth pact. The policy that has been followed in recent years, particularly by France and Germany, has consisted of making an effort in relation to budgetary policy, in an attempt to reduce deficits and debt at the same time as decreasing public revenue, in the hope that this can all be resolved by an increase in growth. This scenario did not work. We have very weak growth, increasing unemployment and an increase in disparity in income between different social groups, with no reduction in exclusion and poverty, in one of the richest regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are alternatives. These have been discussed within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but without success, or at least without achieving a majority. There are alternatives that consist, in particular, of making efforts in relation to supply, certainly, but also substantial efforts in relation to spending. Is it normal that European savings should be financing an increase in military spending in the United States? I formulate the problem in these terms, which is how it must be formulated. There is, therefore, room for a relaunched neo-Keynesian policy, which relies fully on the size of the internal market within the context of a Union of twenty-five and on the need to increase public and private investments. Maybe the growth initiative is moving in the right direction, but it is inadequate in terms of both quantity and quality. We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules, particularly concerning working conditions, salary progression – yes, salary progression – and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to end on the fiscal issue. It is a point we have discussed at great length. I would simply like to tell Mr Schmidt that I was struck by a French Press Agency dispatch, a statement by the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, which said that if the candidate countries continued to decrease corporate tax as they were doing, it would no longer be possible to agree to finance these candidate countries through the structural funds. We would do well to think about this kind of observation, and I maintain – and I am weighing my words carefully here – that those who do not want to subject corporate tax to the system of qualified majority voting laid down in the European Constitution are irresponsible and will have to face ever harsher scenarios of fiscal competition, which will unravel our systems of social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report. It was an excellent report but by the time it came out of our committee earlier this week a lot of the more excellent parts of it were unfortunately removed. What is left is still very useful, very positive, but it is a pale shadow of the excellent and very thorough work that she had put in.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately her amendments were voted out by the PSE Group who were there in strength on Monday. Unfortunately, apart from herself and one other Group Vice President from the PPE-DE Group, I was the only representative of our Group there.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no quibble with the Socialists for what they did in pursuing their agenda. They happen to believe they are right in saying there should be no legislative changes and I am not going to debate that particular point now. I congratulate them for their single-mindedness and the efficiency with which they pursued it. However, I do say to our colleagues, particularly our absent colleagues from this side of the House, that if we care about employment, as we do; if we care about unemployment, as we do; if we care about the social injustice that flows from unemployment, as we do; then we must be prepared to make this area a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is work simultaneously in other Committees, we have to make certain that we can stand up to be counted, so that our view may prevail in these meetings and so that we can drive change. Change is important on the issues of employment guidelines; I was delighted that the Commissioner again reinforced the importance of the Lisbon Agenda, to which all sides of the House have agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we are to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, it is not good enough simply to say that the guidelines will not change before 2006. Similarly, it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines. The guidelines need to be strengthened and refocused and there is a lot of work both to do and to undo in this House in order to give more impetus to the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Stephen Hughes for saying that he is in full agreement of an oral amendment, which I believe the rapporteur will also support, concerning the importance of elderly people, which I will be proposing later this morning. I am delighted to have that agreement; I hope that augurs well for our relationship in the coming mandate. I know that Stephen Hughes hopes to be back; I also hope to be back, but next time with more support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On different occasions, I have been able to develop, on behalf of my group, specific proposals to reform the Pact in order to turn it into the instrument of a European policy of growth and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we recommend greater stringency when the economic climate is good. It would be a case of, for example, requiring the Member States to have a balanced budget when growth exceeds, let us say, 3%, even if it allows them greater infrastructural spending flexibility at the time of an economic turnaround. Our objective is the transposition of the British golden rule to European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Social Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has just taken up the Socialist proposals again. In an interview for the newspaper <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, he recommends that the Pact should be more flexible when the economic climate is poor and stricter when the economic climate is good. At the recent Ecofin Council, the theory that it would be necessary to reform the Pact in 2005 gained ground. The Socialists will bring their constructive participation to this necessary reform, but Mr Juncker will have difficulty persuading his colleagues in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who demonstrate almost religious dogmatism in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact. In fact, stability without growth will only increase the economic and social problems of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I recommend that you read the paper of Professor Jean-Paul Fitoussi for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This paper broadly demonstrates that the Stability and Growth Pact has slowed, and continues to slow, growth in Europe. The Pact is particularly harmful to the large European economies, whose economic activity depends more on internal stimulation than that of the small countries, who depend more on external demand. This certainly explains the fact that the small countries seem more virtuous in relation to stability than the large countries, whether the large countries are governed by the left or the right. Stability and Growth Pact reform is, therefore, not a question of politicking, but rather a vital necessity for a Europe that is losing the fight for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, allow me to address a final word of thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath. Mrs Randzio-Plath will no longer be part of the next Parliament, which saddens me greatly. With her, we will lose a woman who was committed to the euro, to a social Europe and to a Europe of growth and employment. I think that I speak on behalf of all our fellow Members in thanking her publicly for her work at the head of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

We have not only deplored the European Union’s situation of profound underemployment and weak growth, but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level. In order to overcome the various obstacles, I too would like, moreover, now to put forward some political objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we must first of all seize the opportunity that enlargement offers. The new Member States want growth and they need solidarity. Just like us, and even more so, it is in their interest that the enlarged Europe be a much more dynamic region of the world. The fears of the West must, therefore, be dispelled and common interest built, which means that positive mobility, restructuring and specialisation strategies that enable human and productive capacities in the East and the West to be increased are essential. How, though, are these to be brought about?</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms. How can investment be encouraged? Two ways are possible. Only the first of these is being used at the moment: the drawing power of capital for high profitability, with fiscal and statutory competition. Failure is inevitable. Another way is to be opened up. Indeed, we must issue the challenge of a new mixed economy, a mixed economy of multinational cooperation, founded on policies of partnership and networks. This is the structural reform that Europe needs and that we will have to devise.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is the renewal of the macroeconomic framework. The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force, but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with. The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation. National policies differ. The redefinition of this policy must be at the heart of the agenda of the next few years, particularly in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact. I think that with a good European budget and fiscal harmonisation, we would indeed be in a better position to resolve the problems relating to the reduction of national public deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point is a question of method. The Member States have got an absolute nerve: they do not respect the Lisbon strategy; they do not take it on board. We must build up the responsibility of the national parliaments and envisage reinforced cooperation in the field of economics, but it is particularly amongst the players of civil society, amongst businesses and territorial communities, that we suffer most from a loss of profit. There is a mass of activities to start, but a great backlog of projects and of players. European policy is only possible on the basis of decentralised participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bouwman (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Madam President, I should like to make a few comments regarding the procedure we have followed so far, because that is where the necessary difficulties have arisen. I should also like to say something about Lisbon, about Mr Kok's report on the quality of work, about China and India, and finally about the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards procedure, I think that this is the second or third time that we have realised how little time we have when it comes to determining employment guidelines. This causes conflicts among us, beyond the normal political differences, as to how the guidelines should be interpreted, how they should be amended, what needs to be changed and so on. I would suggest a different approach next year; that is a piece of advice to the future presidencies of the Council and to the Commission. It is vital to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to play its role under the Treaty, namely commenting in an appropriate manner, so that we need not vote down a series of votes on a pile of amendments, which, let me put it this way, are not in the correct procedural order. I also wonder whether the triennial procedure we have adopted is the most sensible approach. Given the fast pace of change in the economy, and in view of the fact that the Commission soon had to adjust its optimistic outlook and accept that things were not going as smoothly as expected, I think that we need to have the opportunity to alter some important aspects of these economic and employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out a major shortcoming in the Treaty. It needs to be said. According to the definition, employment guidelines are, in fact, subordinate to economic guidelines. We do not want that. It causes all kinds of problems, for example when liberalisation is on the agenda, but it also means that all kinds of other measures are put forward that have their impact in this way. I agree with what a number of other speakers who have already taken the floor, including Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels, have said on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Little progress has been made since Lisbon. This has been commented on in our committee as well. We have achieved little on poverty and on the participation of older people and women in the workforce. There has been some progress, but far too little and we must really revise the guidelines. We should revise the Lisbon agreements in the light of various factors, including the evolution of the economy. Against that background the position adopted in the Kok report, namely that we must achieve better implementation of the agreements in their entirety, is welcome. That is what the Council was supposed to be doing. I wonder whether it is enough though.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kok proposes discussing and encouraging flexibility and security. He certainly addresses the issue of flexibility, but I see nothing about security. Both Germany and the UK are still blocking the Temporary Agency Workers Directive. That is not in keeping with the principle of promoting the quality of work, also one of Mr Kok's ideas. In other words, I think we must look carefully at this and that we should get back to, for instance, the proposals of the Belgian Presidency on the quality of work. That was a useful report, not only with regard to a simple category like job satisfaction. I also think that we should look not only to the United States but also to developments in China and India. We are currently facing massive off-shore outsourcing with all its consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to thank all those who have cooperated during this last term in office. I can also tell you that the Group of the Greens will support the amendments submitted by Ms Hermange and probably also the oral amendment tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was her first vice-chairman for two and a half years. I was able to appreciate both her rigour and her courtesy, even if, as you know, our ideas scarcely brought us together.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also pleased to hear Mr Goebbels speaking of the harmful aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact. When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago, I think my fellow Members were shocked. It is now clear that, in fact, I was right and that the Stability and Growth Pact is a corset that is far too tight for growth, investment and employment to be able to develop in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, in my opinion, another subject that weighs down European growth, and I think that this is the euro. In order to be convinced, we need only see that the three countries of the Union that have not adopted the euro and have preserved their monetary sovereignty are doing much better than the twelve that have chosen, within the framework of the European currency, to link their destinies and to entrust them to a veritable State Bank, a supreme bank that does not care two hoots about growth in Europe. I hope the subject of the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if, like Mrs Randzio-Plath, I will not return. Personally, I hope to return, but it is far from certain. That said, I very much hope that the consequences of choosing the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign since, in my view, this is the main problem between Europe and its citizens today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The employment guidelines and the Luxembourg procedure in general are very important in achieving this objective, which is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs always examines them with close interest. Our rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, has taken the right approach, for which we thank and congratulate her.</p>
<p class="contents">I could reiterate many of the positions formulated by my fellow Members; however, I shall comment for my part on certain points which I consider should be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">First, increasing employment is a highly complex procedure and policy. It affects all sectors of economic policy, of social policy, of education policy, of vocational training, of transparency, of the fight against tax evasion and of undeclared work. Research and innovation have been particularly highlighted recently. This was, in fact, a decision by the recent spring Council and I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment on the subject, which calls for proper coordination of all these policies when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the application of the guidelines. This coordination policy is very important to the new Member States, which are being called on to adopt European results in their internal policies. We also note that the countries in which there is no proper coordination have the worst performance records in the field of increasing employment. Coordination and complementarity are needed both between European policies and national policies at all levels – central, regional, local – and between all the agencies involved. I agree with the rapporteur's proposals about transparency and simpler procedures and about information on making the best possible use of the structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue on which I want to comment is the issue of structural reform, mainly in the fiscal sector and in the social security sector. It would appear that this issue, however necessary everyone considers it to be, is not easy. It demands a political price, it needs to be distilled by society and matured and this is not happening to the required extent. The assent which we set forth as policy, in order to have meaning and be successful, needs properly informed and prepared citizens, responsible social partners and serious effort if the results of our policies are to become visible and if we are to create trust in our chosen objectives and procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implementation is key to the employment guidelines and to the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so important for us? We understand that not only have the Lisbon guidelines not been pursued and that progress is slow but also, as Mr Dimas commented, the new Member States have to do what we have to do and they have the same problems. Unfortunately size does matter in a situation where we must keep to the employment guidelines and yet overall unemployment and the budget deficit in the new Member States are roughly double that of the EU 15. Size definitely matters.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why implementation is key, rather than new guidelines. Implementation is important, as some people have touched on – in Amendment 5 for example, concerning youth unemployment and as regards women in the workplace – but we also have to look at the issue of older workers, the rapidly ageing population of working age. Also, as was briefly mentioned by the chair of our committee, the job shocks that our regions are now facing, such as the outsourcing and offshoring of work – issues that this House is at last taking seriously – will have to be incorporated into the Lisbon goals. I am sure Mr Dimas will take account of that in his work in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue here is to ensure not only that implementation is key, but also that there is better understanding among the main players – the trade unions and business organisations – of what the strategy is. This clearly does not yet exist in Member States. It is vital with regard to this issue, which is one of the last the Committee on Employment will address before the end of the mandate, that we register that the players concerned by this Lisbon goal are insufficiently aware of the strategy being pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">Also important are the quality of lifelong learning and the regional impact of issues like equal funding and market discrimination. All of these issues are vital and must remain within the Lisbon goal and the employment guidelines. We must strengthen implementation. That is the key to today's debate and I welcome Mrs Hermange's report for that reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the recent reforms of the employment guidelines were a positive step, it now seems clear that the European Union will not achieve the Lisbon goals set for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment rate at the moment is 64%; achieving 70% by 2010 would entail creating 22 million jobs in the new 25-Member European Union. Only through the development of competitiveness and growth potential will Europe achieve this rise in employment and productivity. The 2004 Spring Summit therefore drew up employment recommendations with the aim of highlighting priority areas for action by each Member State and underlining the need to strengthen the exchange of good practice and experience, which have a fundamental role in European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Marie-Thérèse Hermange’s excellent report, which highlights the need to make more effective use of all available instruments, the effort to implement what has already been agreed and the mobilisation of all the players involved. My country, for instance, Portugal, is well on the way to meeting the Lisbon employment objectives, even though it has recently seen its unemployment rate go up, mainly because certain multinationals have pulled out. Even so, the unemployment rate is below the Community average.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the objectives of promoting the employment of women and older workers, Portugal has exceeded them. Let us not evade the issues, however: the economic environment we have in Europe today is very different from the one that formed the backdrop to the Lisbon Summit in 2000. The economic and financial situation in certain Member States demands tough policies to curb public spending and, most of all, structural reforms as a precondition for economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States that remain courageous enough during this economic slowdown not to give in to easy solutions and undertake the necessary reforms of employment legislation, social security schemes, and so on, deserve not reprimands but encouragement and incentives for their ability to reform. I am certain that without structural reforms Europe will not achieve the levels of growth needed to implement the Lisbon objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All this statement does is carry over the pessimistic forecasts made by the Commission for 2004 into the political field. This then is the background against which we must analyse how Europe’s economic situation develops in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines. We cannot continue to dodge the issue. We do in fact have at our disposal powerful theoretical instruments, such as those resulting from the Lisbon Strategy or arising from the good practice associated with economic policy coordination. We also have powerful limitations, however, such as those resulting from too strict an interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which demolish all the efforts we make.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is becoming more and more political, or, put another way, a matter of choices, and while it is true that there can only be long-term, sustainable economic development with financial consolidation, it is also true that there will be no financial consolidation, even in the short term, without economic growth. Europe needs a new agenda, focusing on the problems of the economy and employment, in place of the current agenda, focusing on the budget deficit and public spending, which have become a veritable obsession. What Europe really needs is structural reforms, but it also needs the financial means to carry them through. In the early stages there will always be an increase in public spending or a reduction in revenue, and that can only be possible with a profound change in the budgetary rules in force. It is at this point that delays begin to occur to the proposals for a review of the Stability and Growth Pact announced by the Commission, especially if these proposals focus on the essence and are not confined to sweetening the regulatory aspects of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the SGP is inevitable, partly because this instrument has, strictly speaking, been suspended since 25 November. The new rules can no longer ignore the changes in the economic cycle, or fail to take account of each Member State’s individual situation without prejudice to the efforts to achieve budget conciliation for the whole euro zone. They certainly can no longer ignore the role of public investment and quality spending in the framework of development. Aiming at a zero budget deficit in the euro zone over the long term is complete folly, is not supported by any economic theory and would result in the absurdity of a public debt that would, after all, be no better than zero.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these concerns are to be found in the excellent report tabled by Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, to whom I offer my warmest wishes, because the dealings I have had with her over the last three years have shown her to be a woman who is capable, competent, determined and profoundly pro-European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much has been done in Europe in recent years concerning employment. Specifically, in my country, the People’s Party Government, during its two terms of office, has created more than 4 300 000 jobs. Clearly we all agree on the need to reform our employment strategy, with a considerable degree of stability, and we all also agree on the importance of the three objectives – full employment, improved labour quality and productivity and strengthening of social cohesion – and we will agree on both the common recommendations and the specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress the importance of certain principles which must underpin the application of employment strategies, in addition, of course, to a principle already often repeated here – the need to coordinate economic policies and social policy – and I should like to emphasise the need to horizontalise policies such as equality, health and safety in the workplace and integration, which seem to me to be essential objectives in the construction of Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise, Madam President, the need for improved productivity in the face of relocation – which has already been highlighted by Mrs Bastos – which has disastrous effects on territorial cohesion and the necessary polycentrism of the European Union. I believe that increased productivity and labour quality are the best remedies for slowing down relocation. Nowadays this makes many European citizens sceptical about the European Union. It also seems to me that the link between the structural funds, territorial restructuring impact policies and employment policy is vital for the achievement of territorial cohesion, a tool <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for genuine polycentrism in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for concerted action on the part of the European Union, the Member States, the regions and local authorities and, of course, social dialogue, are other important tools in the application of these directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the term 'European economic policy' which we use is somewhat misleading. The Union does not have primary responsibility on this matter nor, unfortunately, does it acquire it under the new draft Constitution. Primary responsibility lies with the Member States. The Union simply intervenes in a coordinating capacity. Where the Union has responsibility, in monetary policy, we have indisputably seen immense success with the introduction and stabilisation of the single currency. Unfortunately, we cannot also say the same of the management of the real economy. Growth rates have remained low and unemployment has remained at correspondingly high levels. The recession in the real economy has led to a crisis in public finances, with huge deficits appearing in major economies, resulting in collapse due to failure to apply the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">25 November 2003 should have released us from the Stability Pact. Instead, however, we returned to the same tired debates about how to revive it, instead of finding ways to get out of the stagnation of the European economy. There are, of course, two ways. One is a common, truly European policy, within the framework of a mixed economy. We must stop worshiping the market, which has failed miserably because, if you take the 30 years after the Second World War, the mixed economy achieved full employment and high rates of growth. If you take the next 30 years, during which the doctrine of the free economy has triumphed, full employment has collapsed and the European economy has stagnated and weakened. It is time we returned to more logical principles, to a mixed economy like that which served us so well in the post-war years.</p>
<p class="contents">They tell us that unemployment is structural and that, in order to cure it, we need to take structural measures. This simply means measures against the workers. I would reply to this that the lack of investment is structural and that we should act against speculation on the money markets, which has paralysed the investment mechanism. If we could find a new alliance of social forces, then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels. If we cannot find this alliance, then the European economy is condemned to stagnation and, ultimately, to becoming a satellite of the US economy. It is time we realised this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For an example of how to debate economic and employment policies, we should take the debate about the Stability and Growth Pact, a subject about which there was far more public debate than there has been about the economic and employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to put the case for a greater role for the Commission in economic and employment policy, and I urge it to make more use of its right of initiative, rather than hiding behind the unanimity required of votes in the Council. Thirdly, I would like to see an end to unanimity in all economic and employment matters affecting the internal market, which would make it possible for Parliament to exercise its power of codecision and unleash new dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also draw your attention – and particularly that of the left wing in this House – to the whole catalogue of economic and employment policy principles in the new Constitution. In it, rather than setting social policy at odds with the market, we affirm our belief in the social market economy, in sustainability and in full employment; we do not play the various areas off against each other, for they are all mutually dependent and mutually complementary.</p>
<p class="contents">The competitiveness of enterprises is dependent on the skills of employer and employee, as well as on the stability of the currency and on the low level of inflation associated with it. It is on competitive businesses that growth depends, and without growth there are no jobs, and employment is the precondition for social cohesion. If we communicate this, in these terms, to the public and know ourselves bound by these basic principles and by this interaction, this reciprocity, then we will be able to implement the guidelines all the more efficiently. The fact is that we have to get stuck in to the job with greater earnest and greater determination. We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which internal market directives are not transposed. We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which the Commission has over a thousand infringement proceedings pending against Member States. We cannot, we must not, allow Member States to justify breaching the Stability and Growth Pact by saying that, by so doing, they wanted to do something for growth and employment. If that were the case, then Germany would have the highest proportion of people in work; instead, it has the highest proportion of people out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In bringing this speech to a close, let me ask what our weaknesses are. They lie in our structure, in our lack of dynamism, in rigidity and over-regulation, and in population change. Where do our opportunities lie? We have them in enlargement, in the concept of the internal market, in small and medium-sized businesses, in the skills of our workers, in the Lisbon strategy, in the euro and in the social dialogue. Let us take these objectives and make them into action plans and timetables! Let us apply more seriousness and determination to the task of doing away with our weaknesses and seizing our many chances, which are still, like treasure, buried and waiting to be brought to the surface. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that anyone will disagree with this conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to formulate a few more conclusions. Within the framework of the gradual strengthening of economic activity and the increase in employment in the European Union, we need to make decisive progress, as Mr Hughes and other speakers emphasised earlier, in applying our medium-term strategy for economic policy and employment policy, as laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines and the strategy on employment. This strategy continues to apply, both to the old and to the new Member States, as Mrs Kratsa said and, of course, it must be understood in the best possible way, as Mr Moraes pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to safeguard the continuation of both packages of guidelines in accordance with the principle of streamlining. Instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus, even though Mr Bouwman said earlier that conditions are changing. Of course, but there must be important changes, as I said in my first speech. Therefore, instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus on closing the gap between expectations and results. Careful monitoring of these procedures on your part, in close contact with your counterparts in the national parliaments, is the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to success, especially within the framework of the interim review of the Lisbon strategy. This review will be carried out next year and will naturally focus on ways in which we can achieve in practice the main objectives of our economic policy and our employment policy, including productivity, as Mr Pérez Álvarez emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Randzio-Plath presents a series of amendments to the European Commission's recommendations relating to the 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines. The report by Mrs Hermange and her relevant amendments are designed to change the recitals of the guidelines for employment policies for 2004. I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for the constructive way in which they expressed their concerns. I am delighted that the amendments are in line with the strategy which we have agreed on in order to strengthen the economy and employment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments to the recitals of the employment guidelines, I should like to assure you that the European Commission will support in spirit those aspects designed to improve the recitals during further negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the reference to older workers introduced by Mr Bushill-Matthews complements the reference by Mrs Hermange to the young unemployed and our position is therefore positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
