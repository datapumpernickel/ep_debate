Directive 97/67/EC was the first step towards the establishment of such a postal market. For the first time, consumers were given a choice and operators were free to provide their services outside their own small national markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the situation in the Community. As they are currently being interpreted by many Member States, the current VAT arrangements are not compatible with the establishment of an internal market since they provide for the exemption of services provided by certain operators in their own market, their taxation once they dare to supply services in other Member States and the taxation of all other operators at the standard rate, wherever they happen to supply their services.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of legislative inaction, there is a clear risk that the European Court of Justice will be called upon to resolve this apparent breach of the neutrality of the tax in order to re-establish a level playing field and ensure that internal market principles are respected. It could only do so by restricting the scope of the exemption to those services which are still not open to competition. That would mean taxation at the full rate for all other services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, in particular under Article 93. It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal customers. It has taken into account their opinions, in particular those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail, which such customers use most. The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or neutralise any increase in postal prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was the proponent of the universal services concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the union has the right to a wide range of affordable, quality postal services. Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition. The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive. Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would invite Members of the House to support the Commission's proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee and plenary rejected my proposal a few months ago, so now Mrs Lulling and I are back with a list of amendments to appease our critical fellow Members. I would, as the Commissioner says, have preferred that the Commission proposals had been adopted straight off, but there was no majority for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is being liberalised at both European and national level. Several old government postal and telephone companies have been converted to public limited companies. They need different rules. The current unequal tax treatment not only hampers the development of open markets, and thus the deregulation of the postal services, but it also distorts competition and makes it more difficult for both the public and private operators to compete. The economic impact on consumers would be negligible. It is the famous increase of a penny per stamp, or no increase at all. There can even be a price reduction if the Member States use a reduced rate. Those postal operators mentioned by the Commissioner are subject to VAT. They will also be able to reclaim input VAT paid, thus lowering their overall costs. This is good for new investment and the modernisation of old monopoly companies. I should like to emphasise this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made some amendments since the last reading. It is proposed that the weight limit for the reduced rate for standard mail be raised from 2 kg to 10 kg. This is one of the weight limits set by the International Postal Union (IPU). In this way, important pieces of standard mail would be included in the reduced rate range. This includes newspapers, weeklies and other parcels.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the directive is postponed until 2007. This will give enough time to the Member States and postal operators to adapt to the new provisions of the directive. This also fits in with the different liberalisation stages envisaged for the postal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also recommended that the Member States which, on 1 January 2003, applied a super-reduced rate might continue to apply that super reduced rate to postal services. We also have suggestions regarding various organisations that deal with gifts and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these compromises are sufficient. It would be unfortunate if nothing were to happen at all. The biggest issue that has been dealt with recently is the case of Royal Mail. Other providers of postal services, according also to the Commissioner, support this proposal. The industry approves. Data from the national regulator, Postcomm in Great Britain prove that removing the VAT exemption for public operators would not result in price increases for users. It would, on the contrary, create a level-playing field ultimately leading to increased competition, greater choice for postal users and lower prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke to a leading employee of Postcomm who told me that there was no reason for Royal Mail to retain this VAT exemption as it was not needed to protect either Royal Mail or the users. Rather, the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that I have been unable to convince so many intelligent fellow MEPs such as Mr Goebbels, Mr Skinner and Mrs Villiers, and particularly my own party colleague Mr Huhne, to adopt a sensible line of thinking. This is regrettable, and I can but state that if Parliament rejects my proposal again tomorrow – as, unfortunately, there is much to indicate that it will – then I have failed horribly. Maybe we can live with this, as I myself can live with it, but it is however Europe’s consumers who have lost. They are the big losers. I hope that my fellow Members can consider this, if only overnight before the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the run-up to the elections, we face opposition from populists, among others, to our efforts to get this House to say loud and clear what proposals it has to make in respect of the Commission’s proposal for VAT on services in the postal sector. It is for that reason that we have resubmitted our amendments to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply rejecting this proposal out of hand, which is what Mr Goebbels, and others who speak for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have been trying to do for almost a year now, is too primitive an approach. To be sure, it plays well with the public to proclaim your opposition to VAT on postage stamps, but we are well aware that, as various postal services have been liberalised, there will, in the long term, be no getting away from the need to treat postal services and private service providers equally in order to avoid competition in this sector being distorted. So it makes more sense to us to tell the Council of Ministers, and the Commission too, what we want done to prevent postage stamps going up in price.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what our amendments are aiming at. In the first place, we want to defer the entry into force of this directive until 2007, in order to give the postal services enough time to implement it without difficulty. Apart from that, we would like to allow those Member States that have a greatly reduced VAT rate – Luxembourg has been one since January 2003; ours is 3% – to apply it to postal services too. That is a tangible and positive policy; simply saying ‘no’ or adopting some similarly populist approach does no service either to the postal service or to those who use it. I therefore hope that the majority in this House will vote to approve the sensible proposal that I, on behalf of my group, have joined with the rapporteur in bringing forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the total harmonisation of indirect taxation has never been an objective of the European Union. An internal market can work perfectly well with fiscal competition, as long as it is fair competition. The proof of this is the American internal market, in which the fifty States of the Union continue to tax consumption through local taxes of between 0 and 10 percentage points.</p>
<p class="contents">The coordination of VAT rates and excise duties that took place with my modest contribution, in 1991, under the Luxembourg Presidency, established the base rates, including zero rates in some areas, and the ceiling rates, allowing the Member States a degree of freedom of action for a national taxation policy. However, the Commission is still pushing for fiscal unification. Each Community acquis is fiercely defended. This is the case in the debate surrounding a possible decrease in VAT rates for some highly labour-intensive services. Normally, Mr President, people eat wherever they happen to get hungry. There are very few people who will go abroad to find a hair salon with a better rate of VAT. There are even fewer citizens who call on the European competition when they have a plumbing problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission not take notice when the Member States want, for example, to promote employment in certain sectors in which the VAT rate is too high? The Commission’s proposal to abolish the VAT exemption granted to public postal services comes from this same vague desire for standardisation. The postal sector is still a service organised at national level with a national price system. Until, for example, you can put an Italian or Swedish stamp on a letter in France, there will not be an internal postal market, or a real distortion of competition between the different postal systems. The reasons why postal systems are, nevertheless, fighting for the introduction of a VAT rate are basely material. By charging even minimal VAT on standard postal services, postal operators could deduct the VAT paid on their purchases. Those who would not benefit are consumers. They would very quickly face increases in postal prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the Socialist Group will vote against VAT on postal services. We want to defend consumers. The harmonisation of VAT on postal services sought by the Commission is in fact just an attempt to create the conditions required for a subsequent privatisation of a public service for the benefit of certain private companies that are already active in that field. We oppose the privatisation of this universal service which, even in the United States, functions as a public service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not share the Commissioner’s views on liberalisation, but I am not convinced by Mr Goebbels’ arguments. I think that there is already an internal market for postal services, except for private use. Mail to private individuals, for example, only represents 10% of the turnover of the French postal service. The remainder is mired in competition, and there are inequalities in that competition. Contrary to what Mr Schmidt said, I think that the traditional public operators are particularly penalised by the inappropriate taxation system and by being unable to deduct VAT from their purchases. The reasons are not only purely financial; it is about being able to develop. I would also like to add that there is a tax on salaries to compensate for the so-called privilege of VAT exemption .</p>
<p class="contents">It would be paradoxical to claim to want to defend public service companies while allowing them to be strangled. I think that the correct solution in these circumstances is to keep the Schmidt and Lulling amendments, which are a further step to the left, with obligatory reduced and super-reduced rates for services that are part of the universal service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having to submit an amended report twice in order to gain sufficient support struck me as being no mean feat. I hope that the amendments by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling will be supported in the plenary tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, the postal market will be liberalised by no later than the beginning of 2009. You may, or may not, like that, but, now that the decision is before us, it is important to ensure that this does not result in chaos, with the public no longer being able to receive or send mail. The equal treatment of public and private providers of postal services in terms of VAT basis and the VAT rate is therefore of major importance. In addition, with a view to the free postal market, provision must be made for equal opportunities within the internal market. That is why I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the impact of liberalisation, it has lost significant parts of the profitable portion of its market while it continues to bear the burden of carrying a universal service obligation to the furthest corners of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">It must deliver a letter, which may originate in the UK or elsewhere, regardless of the cost and regardless of what area of the country it is addressed to. It is also losing significant state contracts, which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations, because of the public procurement requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">To oblige An Post to now apply VAT to its postal services could well be the death knell of the company. No doubt many of those free market enthusiasts will be rubbing their hands in glee at such a prospect because they can then pick up what remains of the profitable bits of the Irish market. But then what happens to the public service obligation? Who will deliver the letter to the person living alone in the extreme north-west or south-west of the Republic of Ireland?</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government has recently indicated its opposition to this measure, having kept its mouth shut very tightly since the subject was first mooted by the Commission in 2000. I welcome its recent conversion and I hope that it is successful in blocking this measure. There needs to be some common sense in the way we deal with public services like the postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's position as regards the amendments is as follows: the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector, and particularly those carried out under Directive 97/67/EC, should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector. The Commission undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 5.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of a possible compromise with Parliament and with regard to Amendments Nos 4 and 11, the Commission could accept a delay until 1 January 2007 in the entry into force for the actual implementation of the directive in order to allow operators enough time to adapt their systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of a possible compromise with Parliament, which has stressed the need to protect consumers from price increases on standard postal services, and with regard to Amendments Nos 6, 9 and 10, the Commission could agree to widening the proposed scope of postal services that may qualify for a reduced rate so as to include standard postal services relating to items of up to 10 kg in weight.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 1 and 7, recent events have once again shown that Member States are very much attached to the optional nature of reduced rates, and the Commission cannot, therefore, undertake to amend its proposal in this sense. However, these amendments would indicate in no uncertain terms that this Parliament considers price stability of postal services of paramount importance and certainly sends a political signal to Member States to make use of the option which the proposal includes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 3 and 8, the Commission considers reduced rates under 5% to be temporary measures which should not be applied to new categories of goods or services.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 2, endorsing a reimbursement mechanism for charitable organisations, the Commission would like to repeat its view that nothing in the Sixth Directive prevents Member States from introducing such a mechanism outside the VAT system. However, it would not be appropriate, nor in keeping with the subsidiarity principle, to amend its proposal to advise Member States how they should spend their tax receipts.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards Amendment No 13, the Commission considers the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different from those existing today. Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value. They are taxable in all other cases. Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
