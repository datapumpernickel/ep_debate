<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I too have been deeply moved by the debate we have just had. What I have to say is that these things must be nipped in the bud. We often hear people expressing hatred of the European Union too, and of democracy in Europe, and I think we need to make a start soon on educating and informing them and making Europe’s people more aware of Europe’s values.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we attach particular importance to this ‘<span class="italic">e-</span>Content Plus’ programme, which is intended to get high-quality content onto global networks. Presenting Europe on global networks is something we see as having a strategic advantage in that global networks can be accessed directly and immediately and in that we can thereby exploit the opportunities offered in a worldwide context.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that our achieving, at second reading, funding for the programme to the tune of EUR 149 million for the period up to 2008 offers a considerable opportunity to make significant improvements to this European content on digital networks. We have also set aside EUR 55.6 million for the period up to the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, or so I believe, this programme has already shown its capacity for making us more competitive, thus acting in support of the Lisbon objectives, and we are now seeing a vast number of new jobs being created in the information and communication technology sector. If we want to create another 10 million jobs by 2010, ‘content’<span class="italic"> </span>must be a core element in the strategy for achieving the Lisbon criteria. We face the major challenge of putting Europe on the Net and focusing particular attention on it and its small and medium-sized enterprises. Agencies for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises have come into being, and they should also devise new business models for the digital content.</p>
<p class="contents">Having seen the Internet hyped, we are now entering the next stage of its expansion, and this is where the Commission has done exemplary work. I would like to extend very warm thanks to all those who have played a part in this, because this, quite simply, gives us a chance to create global standards in which we can take a great deal of pride.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the <span class="italic">e-</span>Content programme should be highly comprehensive – as we see from the Budget – in categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It should also have an impact on the European institutions. We should give thought to how we can better prepare our content and how we can bring it closer to the citizens, particularly in schools. Researchers should also be offered a broad range of linked virtual libraries, including rapid access to them via search engines. The latter exemplify the widest possible variety of highly interesting business models, with the possibility of new links and of very rapid access to the most important digital content in existence.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that scientific resources have developed a great deal over the years; one only needs to think of a library in an old monastery, in which people once compared the curative properties of camomile when applied to various parts of the body. A small example maybe, but it shows how science can derive great benefit from what has been learned in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also have to consider telecommunications, looking at which licensing systems we can use in future, and at how we handle the granting of rights to use. It is here that it is becoming evident that micro-payments in the telecommunications sector offer models for refinancing or cofinancing. As we all know, what costs nothing is worth nothing, and it is for that reason that I regard as ideal the 50% cofinancing that the Commission has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Being well-known as a campaigner for Europe’s small and medium-sized business structures, let me say that it is in the local sphere that we should give massive support to digital TV and the programmes that it offers. Packages of minimal size – I am thinking in terms of about EUR 100 000 each – but with a multiplicity of such programmes to prepare this European content in a professional way, are therefore likely to be particularly important in future. This could give rise to a degree of competition between those that are public and funded by fees and those in the private sector, which would be funded by incentives and are currently making massive advances in these modern sectors, as are the telecommunications companies that will in future also be providing this digital content through mobile telephones. These are quite new ways in which Europe could show that we are, quite simply, up there with the leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Where <span class="italic">e-</span>Government is concerned, the European Union – the Commission, Parliament, and the Council – should set an example. We need not only to have the very latest and most up-to-date hardware and software; I see ‘best practice’ as something that begins at home. We should show that there are governments in Europe that are perfectly capable of showing us, at European level, in what direction we could develop. In the area of <span class="italic">e-</span>health, there is much that we could do in terms of prevention and analysis. In the <span class="italic">e-</span>learning sphere, we can present a great deal of knowledge using ‘learning entertainment’, so that teachers in schools can at last have access to exciting and interesting materials.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where, at European level in particular, we can support our 20 languages and Europe’s cultural diversity. The infrastructure that we will need in future will also enable us to see this Europe of ours in a new light. We need to be fascinated by Europe and to love it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is rather unusual and that is why I wish to underline it. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and all the Members involved in the negotiations who made it possible to find an agreement with the Council while preserving the means for a proper functioning of this programme, in particular as far as the budget is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the availability of content is one of the essential factors for the development of the new information society services. In the digital economy, content covers all types of information, text, images and sounds that can be transmitted by the networks. The eContent Plus Programme focuses on improving the conditions for innovation, notably in certain sectors of the digital content market. The online environment provides an ideal platform for innovative digital content products and services that transcend national boundaries. That is why this programme has a real European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine that Europe had one digital content market, without barriers imposed or national and organisational boundaries – a market where all consumers would understand all the languages of the Union. It is likely that we would see many more maps, for example of trans-European roadways, waterways and other features, on the Internet. As the rapporteur has just underlined, we would see large European digital libraries of cultural and scholarly repute. We would see a greater abundance of European digital learning material, which our schools and teachers need. There would be a real cross-fertilisation between cultures and access to each other’s traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is exactly what we want to achieve with the new programme. But we know that much remains to be done in order to overcome existing fragmentation and to allow businesses to develop innovative cross-border digital content products and services. Nevertheless, this is one of the rare programmes where SMEs are <span class="italic">very</span> much integrated. When I look at how the programme has been working so far, out of the 600 organisations participating in the funded projects, 241 participants are SMEs. So this programme is of benefit to those SMEs that show innovation and want to go in the direction of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In this programme we will focus only on those parts of the digital market where there is a clear fragmentation in Europe and where market forces alone cannot operate sufficiently well in driving growth. We are, therefore, targeting three domains: spatial or geographical data, educational material and cultural content. We will also give special attention to the linguistic diversity of the European Union, because we know that today’s information technologies can be made to work and to overcome the difficulties in combining formats and languages.</p>
<p class="contents">This takes organisational effort, it takes experimenting at cross-border level, and that is exactly what eContent Plus will deal with. It will strengthen the conditions for a flourishing content market for the benefit of business, citizens and culture. That is also why the Commission is happy to accept the amendment tabled by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for the excellent report he has produced, and above all for the prompt agreement on the EUR 149 million that this important programme certainly needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us bear in mind that the overall market for digital content amounted to some EUR 515 000 000 as long ago as 2002. It is growing, and may it continue to do so, for it is part of our Lisbon Strategy, aimed at making Europe the most competitive of regions. That is also of course dependent on our overcoming the obstacles that exist in the EU on the grounds of the various languages, cultures, mentalities and – of course – traditions of administration. We also, of course, have market failures to deal with, and if we are to act to deal with all these things, we need to some degree financial help from the EU, in the shape of start-up funding to help us over these obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we have to inject meaningful content into the infrastructures that already exist and those that are technically possible, such as third-generation mobile telephones; this will enable us to improve the lives of our citizens and, of course, also make them easier. Perhaps I might be allowed to draw attention to the implications of this for policy on the regions, the environment and transport. If we add meaningful content to a functioning market, it means that we can offer high-quality jobs to sparsely-populated regions – mountainous areas among them – and enable people to carry on living in them, so that they do not end up being depopulated. It also means that there will be less traffic in conurbations, and there are also positive effects in terms of the environment, in that fewer emissions and so on are produced.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I very much welcome this programme and do of course hope that it will come to fruition as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that Parliament has been able to increase the level of funding from the initial EUR 135 million offered by the Council to what we are looking at now: EUR 149 million. It is particularly important that we have managed to secure, as the rapporteur stated, EUR 55.6 million before the end of this financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the initial eContent report, I am very encouraged to see this sort of proposal on eContent Plus taking shape so quickly. Digital content in this era is one of the fastest growing areas. Without an equally rapid response from Europe we could continue to be left behind and we really have to maximise the opportunities arising in this area in order to challenge some of the dominance that the United States has managed to secure. With ever-rising private ownership, there is a lot more we could do, so I particularly welcome this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many opportunities for us to do more given the huge diversity of languages we have with 25 Member States. The eContent Plus Programme should now make a significant impact on all the media, as has been said by the Commissioner and others, in terms of books, public sector information and the media in general. But one of the problems we face within the EU is the variety of industries, from textiles to telecommunications, that are fragmenting our national markets. That variety faces us with even more challenges in terms of coordination and ensuring we remain competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that we can guarantee safety of information for highway users because that is one of the issues. It impedes various people from using the Internet to its fullest and we need to do more to spread this culture of information. We need to do more to expand the EU websites, not just to give all EU citizens access to their representatives, but also to reduce their frustrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Digital content must become as accessible as possible for people with disabilities. Visual disabilities spring to mind, for which speech technology or a Braille keyboard is available. This accessibility leaves something to be desired, because the technical characteristics of websites do not sufficiently correspond to the special equipment used by those people. Although W3C guidelines are in place for good website standards, the implementation of these guidelines is still very much lacking. The eContentPlus programme should contribute to the international harmonisation of accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. It is even financially lucrative for businesses to get involved. The development of the accessible applications may cost more, but the costs saved in maintenance and management make up for this in the financial result. This is a subject that very much deserves a place in the programme, all the more so because the objective of accessibility, more so than other objectives, requires international harmonisation. In my view, attention to accessibility for people with disabilities is important in helping me determine whether there is sufficient added value over and above national policy so that the increase in budget can be approved. Attention to people with specific needs should be fleshed out by integrating accessibility in the programme as a whole. Can I assume that the Commission intends to include accessibility requirements in the selection criteria and indicators for performance measuring? I should like to hear how strong an emphasis the Commission will place on accessibility for people with disabilities in terms of the relevant budget, because that should demonstrate whether the programme actually ensures that people with disabilities gain access to digital information and services, which certainly forms part of the European Union’s values and standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The developments we are seeing in the fields of applied mathematics and information technology are quite simply overwhelming, and they are accompanied by an equally rapid development of electronic technologies, particularly the reduction of size to a minimum whilst user functions are increased to a maximum.</p>
<p class="contents">All these developments are motivated by what I would call noble purposes, such as education, broadening access to culture and making administration and banking more efficient. In turn, this ought to promote the development of all scientific and technological disciplines, boost the economy and improve defence and security, including protection against terrorism. This should all be achievable by anyone who needs such access. I said ‘anyone’, but I must qualify this, as access and facilities of this kind must not under any circumstances be made available to criminals, including the various sorts of computer pirates. An effective way of stopping this group of potentially malicious users must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also view this decision in the context of other documents, in particular the Parliament and Council decision on safer use of the Internet and online technologies. Yet we cannot on the one hand talk about convenience, and then on the other set our sights on introducing patents on computer programs. We would do better to search for a way of providing widespread and high-quality Internet access cheaply, for example via low-voltage electricity networks.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from what I have said that the draft decision should be seen as a constructive suggestion. I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, although unfortunately the amount set aside to implement this initiative falls far short of what is needed. The Council has proposed EUR 135 million, the rapporteur EUR 149 million and the Commission EUR 163 million. How does this square with the goals of the Lisbon strategy? How can such important goals be achieved for so little money? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it succeeds, it will lend support to the most fundamental component in the Lisbon Strategy. It cannot take effect too soon. I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Rübig, for his excellent work. We hope that the Commission will swiftly implement the changes accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the networked environment as a medium for knowledge and skills cannot increase unless there is essential, first-rate, reliable, comprehensive and safe content available. We, the Union’s legislators, have an obligation to ensure that all our citizens have high-quality European digital and information resources at their disposal. We recognise our cultural diversity and the growing needs of our citizens and the great opportunities that diversity offers.</p>
<p class="contents">Multiculturalism can also be a source of wealth in the digital world. It is for that very reason that the digital world is a different, self-made, artificial, stimulating, deceptive and furiously powerful tool. That is why we know that European action is needed to safeguard diversity and quality. We also know that global market forces cannot offer services like it. That is why we know that pan-European content production is vital to enable us to progress from an information society to an educated one. We are a part of that public sector which has to produce digital services for civil society. Let us therefore attend to the matter of funding. I am therefore pleased with Mr Rübig’s amendments, in which the money available for the programme has been increased from the cuts made earlier on by the Council. For the digital world to be one that is common to all, everyone must be involved, regardless of social position. Democrats must not tolerate digital dictatorship, but that is another matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
