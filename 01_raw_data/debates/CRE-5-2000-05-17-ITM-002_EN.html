<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, broadly speaking, the report tabled before plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contains a particularly positive appraisal of the Commission’s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States. The committee has worked with its usual efficiency and diligence and has supported its proposals with an impressive econometric analysis which I should like to praise here in public.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation for the year 2000 has been formulated at a time of favourable developments and optimistic prospects for the European economy. The prospects of an increase in the national wage in Europe in excess of 3% for 2000 and 2001 – 3.4% according to the latest forecasts for 2000 – are much higher than the disappointing actual average rates of increase throughout the 1990s. These results, provided that they are realised, offer a window of opportunity, a springboard from which the European economy can launch on to a course which will lead to a permanently high and ecologically sustainable rate of growth. It goes without saying that permanently high rates of growth are the sine qua non for improving the employment situation and strengthening the competitiveness of Europe in the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepts that the requisite rate of progress is best expressed through a growth rate of GDP of 3% or more, that this rate cannot be maintained over time without a substantial rise in the potential product of the EU economy and that there can be no increase in the potential product without productive investment. The Commission, however, has avoided specifying the ratio of investment to GDP. The Committee on Economic Affairs takes the view that quantitative economic targets may be useful, but insists that the fixing of such targets must not undermine the goals established in the stability pact, which are the fundamental guide for the economic policies in the euro zone. Despite this general reservation, the report by the Committee on Economic Affairs expresses the committee’s satisfaction at the restatement in the Commission recommendation of the quantified target, set in the Presidency conclusions of the European Council at Lisbon, of raising labour force participation from 61% to 70% of the population by 2010 and of increasing the participation of women from 51% to over 60% by 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs maintains that the requisite economic growth must be based on price stability and budgetary discipline, reasonable wage increases taking account of price stability, productivity increases and a reduction in unit labour costs, even in the case of reductions in working hours. It also believes in greater liberalisation of competition, strengthening national competition authorities, providing special support for associations of small- and medium-sized enterprises and further developing the single market – especially in the public utilities and financial services sectors. As far as financial services are concerned, having reached a broad consensus of agreement, we shall be tabling a joint amendment calling for the action plan for financial services to be applied more quickly, i.e. by 2003 rather than 2005. The majority of the committee believes that mobilising the market will result in the need to increase investments using purely market instruments. At the same time, however, it approves of the restructuring of government spending in favour of investment which must be justified – when it is justified – by the cost-benefit ratio, but rejects using public investments simply to manage the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, the committee approves of the challenges identified by the Extraordinary Council in Lisbon of full employment, a knowledge-based economy, modernisation of social protection systems and dealing with the impact of the ageing population, but expresses its concern at the gap between the key challenges and the often routine specific policy recommendations. It therefore calls upon the Commission and Council to seriously consider the need for a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind the general guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also reiterates Parliament’s previous call for an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament on the subject of the adoption of the resolution, although it thanks the Portuguese Presidency for its willingness to cooperate on this matter. This is ad hoc cooperation, however, not cooperation reflected in an interinstitutional agreement, and we consider this a shortcoming in our procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we achieved a significant degree of consensus in our work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade. Of course, there are certain differences in our assessment of the best way of achieving these targets. Some of us believe that setting quantitative targets, even without mechanisms for imposing them, would help Europe give concrete expression to its efforts to move in the right direction. This comment applies in particular to the target investment rate, which requires us to increase the potential rate of growth of the economy to 3% on a permanent basis. This percentage is a familiar figure. The Commission set it repeatedly in its studies and it would not have hurt to have included it. We could also have given more categorical expression to the, I believe, general feeling that we need to relaunch the trans-European networks and address the need for new forms of financing for them and the issue of the involvement of private capital and public investment in this sector. Without, in any way, giving the green light to squander public spending, we could have tried to give the public sector of the economy a slightly more positive role than merely that of ‘guard-dog’ for price stability. There are margins for all this, especially through the window of opportunity, if the main risk to our economy is from the probability of a crisis on the American money markets which could paralyse the private investment mechanism. Just imagine, ladies and gentlemen, if that were to happen and we, in the meantime, had forgotten how to handle public investment. The European economy has a huge margin for growth; it is true that the European economy can become more productive, but we need to be bolder in the way we go about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, it stressed the importance of the connection between these two priorities and considered that the common elements of the broad guidelines of economic policy should be fully exploited and the various implementing processes adopted by the Councils over the years coordinated, and by this I am referring to the objectives of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes. In our opinion, the open method of coordination, which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon, should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment, which, we feel, cannot be ignored. </p>
<p class="contents">The subsidiarity principle needs to be steered in this direction with regard to the role both of the governments and of the decentralised institutions, without diminishing the decisive part played by greater synergy, greater coordination between the broad guidelines, and by placing greater focus on the European Community dimension with a view to developing an economic policy which can enhance the potential for development in Europe and allow us to effectively achieve the goals which we set ourselves with regard to full employment. </p>
<p class="contents">We have taken the chapters of the broad guidelines into account, in particular the aspects related to the introduction of flexibility and efficiency elements in the products market, the financial services market and the labour market, but we have also acknowledged the importance of the negotiations of the Social Partners and of social objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">A further consideration: we consider – and for the remainder we refer you to the text of the opinion – that Parliament’s role in this matter must be consolidated by formal institution of the procedure laying down a specific interinstitutional agreement on the participation of Parliament in formal consultations on the economic policy guidelines and on the monitoring of their effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would not wish to commit myself to a percentage in this respect, but we should all be aware that some of the economic framework conditions are established by the European Union and others are established by the Member States. This state of affairs will only prove successful in the long term if it is accomplished on the basis of common principles. The principle enshrined in the Treaty is that of the market economy – the majority in this House would say the social market economy – and there are two key aspects to this. Firstly, there is competition. The European Union is very good at creating conditions for competition. I welcome with open arms the initiatives produced by the Commission aimed at gradually decentralising competition policy and this desire to foster competition and to allow the individual Member States and the regions to play their part in the process. This is a very important development.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second important cornerstone of the social market economy is the stability of the currency. Firstly, we have the European Central Bank, a strong European institution. Secondly, we have the social partners, who are responsible for currency stability, and thirdly, there are the national governments and parliaments, which draft their budgets. I feel I should point out that not only is currency stability one of the cornerstones of economic policy, it is also one of the cornerstones of any social policy, because currency stability is the starting point for social policy, and inflation does not affect those with huge assets at their disposal, but those who have to manage on a small income. That is why currency stability is such an important cornerstone of our policy. And one of the crucial cornerstones we have created is the Stability and Growth Pact. I am delighted that this report is now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be rigorously applied, for what we want for the European Union is growth based on currency stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and I am pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is to negotiate, for the first time, with the troika of EU Finance Ministers on the broad outlines of economic policy, will enter into these negotiations with a report that will attract a broad consensus. We all know that Lisbon brought a fresh wind of change, and it would only be to the good if the broad outlines of economic policy were to exude more of the spirit of the Lisbon EU Summit. The main issue facing the European Union, combating unemployment that is, is still not being treated as the most important aspect of the broad outlines of economic policies. After all, the cost of unemployment in the European Union is estimated to be 12% of European GDP. Therefore, the European Union is right to make full employment its goal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What concerns me most is that the broad outlines of economic policy are still lacking in commitment when it comes to taking advantage of increased investment activity. We are certainly doing the right thing in aiming for structural reform of the goods, services, capital and labour markets. However, whilst we do not yet know what effects structural reforms of this kind will have on employment, we do know what the effects of investment-backed growth are. We know that public investment can boost growth and employment as well. That is why we should welcome the introduction of quantitative targets for growth and employment quotas, for they supplement quantitative targets and benchmarking for investments.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the fact that the targets set at Lisbon – and consequently, those set in relation to the broad outlines of economic policy as well – are not qualitative in nature. Surely this could only benefit Europe, which wants to be the most competitive zone in the whole world. Nor is there any indication whatsoever as to what level of investment as a share of GDP we need to aim for in what time frame, in order to produce a sustainable upturn. The current upward trend is encouraging, especially since the German and Italian economies, which account for half of the net product in euroland, are at last starting to move. This is a perfect illustration of how interdependent and interwoven the European national economies are, for they have not exactly acted as engines of growth on the European economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are aware that we need a form of economic government in Europe. Europe must sing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to economic policy. We therefore need better coordination than we have had hitherto. Hence, I hope that the broad outlines of economic policy will be given substance, so as to render the language of the Lisbon decisions more comprehensible, and enable a timetable to be set. Of course, we must support the rapporteur in his desire for something we have repeatedly called for ourselves: what we need is an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so as to overcome the democratic deficit in Economic and Monetary Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when we are debating the weakness of the euro, at least in relation to the dollar, I think that we would do well to remember that the state of the European economy is solid and offers a framework for stability and solidity as well as excellent prospects for growth and employment. In short, we can look forward to very positive development over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the fact that, in some ways, the US economy is doing better than the European economy, at least in terms of growth forecasts, should not mask the fact that the European economy is doing well at the moment. Furthermore, it is the European economy which is funding a good portion of US development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not only be concentrating on the more positive aspects; we should also be taking note of the fragility of continued growth and solidity in the European economy. In order to overcome this fragility, in our view, we need the European economy to function better, since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity, in both the public and private sectors, and on the part of both economic and social operators.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market. This would clearly involve the removal of the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the European internal market and a deep reform of the tax system, with the adoption of a tax package at European level. To sum up, we should overcome the conservatism which still exists in certain economic and social areas of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Obviously, we endorse the general thrust of the Katiforis report. In particular, we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and, above all, salary agreements. On the other hand, we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous. We shall reject these amendments. Indeed, we shall reject them systematically, and we hope within the current parliamentary term to convince our fellow Members, including those in the Group of the European People’s Party, how dangerous they are.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely. Endorsing the goal of a European society which is as competitive as possible in terms of know-how means maximising investment in human capital. Well, enhanced human capital is not a commodity to be taken and then dispensed with, but rather something to be respected, something that is offered to an individual by allowing them time to be trained, to gain and enhance experience. So if there must be structural reform in wages, then it must be in the direction of greater, and not less, stability in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second fundamental point of which I desperately hope to convince my fellow Members in the next five – now four – years, and that is that we cannot claim to wish to respect the Kyoto Agreement by the year 2008. We are aware, and the report acknowledges as much, that, at the moment, it is contradictory to attempt to reconcile an objective of 3% annual growth with the rejection of the urgent requirement to invest in energy saving, transport systems, in improving accommodation, in such a way as to make the Kyoto objectives and the objective of 3% growth compatible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I recognise the contribution made by Parliament and our rapporteur in gaining acceptance once again for the concept of full employment, I think that the rapporteur himself, whom I congratulate on his efforts, would agree that we need to redefine what we mean by employment and by full employment. What does employed mean when we have before us a policy which dismantles working relations, minimises employment and, as a result, makes general poverty a mass phenomenon. As far as its general approach is concerned, the Commission’s recommendation forms part of a more general neo-liberal economic and social policy which, with the support of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, finds expression in the report under discussion. As far as we are concerned, the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment, stable, permanent and full employment, protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers. This is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking.

<p class="contents">There is not a word, however, on the current depreciation of the euro and its influence on the economy and economic policies. This seems all the more surprising because every few pages the Commission document reiterates the idea that efficiency demands an overall strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">The same is unfortunately true of the European Parliament’s report since, out of the 35 points raised in the resolution, not one relates to the single currency, and it is only briefly referred to in the recitals.</p>
<p class="contents">Apparently, the rule of silence is prevailing, as it did when the major groups within Parliament rejected the proposal from the Union for a Europe of Nations Group to organise, as of today, a debate on the implications of fluctuations in the euro. This debate has been deferred once again, even though there is a great deal to be discussed. For years, all the economic and financial advantages a strong euro was going to offer have been trotted out for our benefit. Now the euro is weak, are we to assume that the loss of these advantages has no implications worth mentioning? This is surely some mistake! The weak euro favours exports, as is often boasted. It also, however, presents serious disadvantages which are concealed, such as the misappropriation of capital, third party buyouts of euro zone businesses or weakening of the incentive for structural reforms, even though these are so necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the basic problem still remains. This depreciation in the euro has occurred because it is perceived as an artificial currency, but until this is clearly stated it will not be possible to remedy the situation. In this instance too, then, let us hope that the European Parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future, before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were promised a euro-cum-mark that would be stronger than the dollar, and which would compensate for the weakness of economic growth by means of the on-going revaluation of assets. We have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its non-identifiable character.</p>
<p class="contents">Formerly, speculation on the exchange market involved the pound. Now it is the euro. This is nothing particularly surprising for us Members of the European Parliament who are accustomed to seeing Europe operating on a daily basis amid differences and antagonisms. What will the situation be like after enlargement, when the markets will react to any event affecting any one of the thirty odd countries which make up the European technostructure? It would almost be like the United Nations issuing a currency.</p>
<p class="contents">This reduction in the value of the euro is not something that Mr Duisenberg can do anything about, as this European Central Bank, whatever they say, is the brainchild of the two main States in the euro zone, and the French and German Governments have given the order to do nothing. In order to maintain the value of the euro in relation to the dollar, we should have to raise euro interest rates to a level which is slightly higher than that of the dollar, perhaps to a level in the order of 50 base points. From my standpoint as a post-Keynesian, I see this as having little impact on economic growth, since this depends on various other factors, the most important of which are psychological.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we cannot agree to all assets located in France being devalued if the downward slide of the euro continues beyond the short term. If this should happen, and obviously we hope it does not, then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible, and this would not mean Mr Duisenberg. We shall judge the candidates in the French presidential elections according to the efforts they have made to get us out of this bind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paragraph 14 supports the Stability Pact’s demand that price stability should always precede employment-related considerations. Elsewhere, the desire is for higher employment and more democratic influence upon economic policy. However, inflation should always, of course, be between zero and two per cent. This is something that is supported, even though inflation has only stood at that rate for a period of six years in post-war Germany and Denmark. It is now quite certain, however, that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times. We no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix. We have a Central Bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation. In this way, the euro is allowed to depreciate and interest rates are increased with the result that there may be lower rates of growth and increased unemployment. It is worse than the sacred cows in India, yet the report does not protest against this. In paragraph G, on the other hand, a new sacred cow is to be found: that of high taxation. Social security arrangements must be critically examined and social expenditure reduced, but savings can also be made on social expenditure by making higher employment the top economic objective. In that way, people receiving cash benefits and unemployment benefit will be able to exchange these for proper wages. That is an alternative recipe for economic policy, but one which is contrary to the Treaty. The balance of trade deficit is normally to be no more than one per cent of GNP, irrespective of whether the money is used for investments, which can subsequently produce much larger deficits again. This would seem to be something which no amount of elections in the Member States or in the EU Parliament can change. This is absurd. It runs counter to all experience and is a denial of the principle of democracy which unites our countries and which means that voters can go to the polls and vote in favour of higher employment, even if inflation might, as a result, occasionally rise above the two per cent mark. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment levels in Europe are too high, particularly as the more vulnerable members of society, i.e. young people, women and the long-term unemployed, are affected. In addition to launching a technical offensive in economic terms within the Union, for example, by setting up highways of information and focusing on research and development expenditure, it is of paramount importance to step up investment by approximately 10%, so as to secure growth and bring unemployment levels down. We must carry on heavily promoting the establishment and continued operation of small- and medium-sized enterprises, by improving access to foreign capital, dismantling bureaucratic hurdles, reducing the burden of taxation and also offering free business advice.</p>

Many matters are best dealt with at Community level, but when I read the report of my colleague Mr Katiforis – which provides several guidelines which are favourable to the market economy and therefore worthy of support – I cannot agree with some of the proposals in it. The dynamism and desired growth of the European economy will not come about by creating Union-wide integrated programmes, whether they be applied with good intentions in the area of training or entrepreneurship or whether they be common support systems for the benefit of SME organisations. I also have my personal doubts about the superiority of a European scientific community, if it is to be created from above, i.e. by the volition of the Commission and the Council, and not allowed to develop naturally through networking between the scientific communities, from one business or university to another; financing, both at a national and European level, must naturally be secured.</p>
<p class="contents">Something which I have reservations about is the faith in the importance of top-level structures which stands out in this report; a programme and planning from the top may actually put the brakes on development rather than make it dynamic. At present, European dynamism will be improved by dismantling top-level structures, for example, barriers to trade, which are still hindering the creation of a genuine internal market. This is what Mr Katiforis is also calling for, albeit of the Commission, when it should be demanded of those nation states, which – in a few individual cases – practice obstructionism, for example, in the areas of transport, public procurement or energy. </p>
<p class="contents">When discussing economic policies in the context of this report, we should not forget about competition policy. Recently, the neutrality of the Communities’ competition policy has been called into question – justifiably so – <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the case of Volvo-Scania. The reason given for regional monopolies and concentration of power in regions with a small population base is rather lame. It is clearly a real blow to the industry and trade of small and remote countries while they are making efforts to increase their competitiveness within the Union area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Compared to the US and Japan, we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland – countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success.</p>
<p class="contents">We need scientists in order to have research and development. Let us stop young people choosing to do other things. Let us encourage women.

<p class="contents">The ambition to achieve full employment and a modern economy, as declared in Lisbon, are indeed laudable objectives, but they are now effectively coming up against the liberal yoke. In its document on the broad economic guidelines, the Commission pursues this liberal approach, and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States. The Commission, indeed, shows no compunction in issuing orders to this or that State with a view to drawing up its budget. It clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining, even going beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact. Following the example of the Central Bank, it demands wage moderation as well as structural reform of the labour market, especially in order to make it more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the Lisbon decisions. It advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages. It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market. This is why I am unable to approve of the guidelines contained in this report, especially when made exacerbated by the many amendments introduced by the right wing.</p>
<p class="contents">The current economic situation, particularly with the decline in the euro, ought to lead the Union and the Member State governments to strive towards the reorientation of European policy, so as to enable it at last to fulfil expectations regarding social issues. We must shake up the dogma of the Stability Pact. We must reverse the current approach, which makes social policy nothing more than a consequence of economic and monetary policy, responsible only for making good the damage caused by the market by means of a policy of aid. This new policy should be particularly based on support to investment that creates jobs by means of a selective policy of credit, the improvement in living and working conditions and a reduction of working hours without flexibility or increased precariousness, taxation on income and financial measures to curb speculation and to release new resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, as recent events concerning the euro illustrate, the European Union and the institutions are currently at a crossroads: we have the choice between the road to prosperity and growth, undertaking radical structural liberalisation reforms that Europe must implement boldly, and the road of preservation and the perpetuation of a corporate, statist vision of the economy which is condemning many European countries to levels of unemployment which are two or three times higher than those in America and to a marginal role in the most innovative and dynamic sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I cannot fail to welcome the Katiforis and Pomés Ruiz reports, which clearly stress the way in which the liberalisation and flexible nature of the markets – especially the labour market – the dramatic reduction in tax pressure, a thorough reform of state pension systems and the gradual separation of state and economy<span class="bold"> – </span>first and foremost through the privatisation of public companies – are all choices which cannot now be put off any longer if we want to avoid building a Europe which may well be united, but united by unemployment, marginalisation of the most vulnerable, in particular women and children, and by the endless red tape surrounding the social initiatives of the society, a Europe, that is, which will fail to create either growth or employment. </p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the shortcomings of the euro, a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible, excessively regulated markets. Some say that political control of the economy at European level would be a way of resolving this crisis. Beware! If political control has to be a means of control which transfers the interventionism of national economies to Brussels, this would be a bad move. We Italian Radicals are also in favour of political control, but federalist, liberal control, with a limited number of clear laws and no state intervention in the economy, even by the European State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should, however, qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle. Both the Commission’s recommendation and the resolution claim high economically sustainable growth as the highest good and pursue this remorselessly. This is odd, given the global relations in which the rich West is seen as an exclusive residential neighbourhood. Do we want even more? Do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means? </p>
<p class="contents">The lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society. It stimulates egocentricity, social exclusion, a blurring of moral standards and moral decay. The corruption of society eventually harms economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note, attention is paid to the effects of an ageing population on the sustainability of government funds. Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen. A further consolidation, a reduction in the debt burden, is desperately needed in many Member States, so as to ensure that funds are available in future for health care and provision for old age. Taxes and social security contributions in the European Union are high compared to the United States, but the picture changes fundamentally when we consider the sometimes extortionate insurance premiums which American citizens have to pay. </p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support. After all, the Kyoto Agreement more than merits compliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the view expressed earlier by Mrs McNally that you can look to the United States and see that there has been investment in research. That is one of the reasons why the United States is doing better than Europe. But we must also emphasise that one of the other reasons why the United States continues to do so much better than Europe is because Europe has not yet properly addressed the issue of structural reform and market liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to the remarks made earlier by Mr Lipietz for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation. The fact is that we have not yet seen the agreed market liberalisation within Europe applied in some Member States, not least his own. I have a shared concern about the jobs of workers. I would be very pleased to bring Mr Lipietz to speak to workers in the United Kingdom who may lose their jobs as a result of decisions made by a French owner of energy companies in the UK, when British companies are not allowed to gain access to the French market because the French have not applied agreed European policy. That is a structural reform we must drive through.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just in that area. We see that the wealthiest states within the European Union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid. That is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here. That is also one of the reasons why I do not share the view expressed by Mr von Wogau in relation to competition policy. My concern, where decentralisation is concerned, is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evident that more economic management is required at European level, but it is not so evident that only the 11 euro zone countries or the Ecofin Council will need to take on that coordination. At the Lisbon Summit, a decision was made precisely in favour of a wider socio-economic approach in which employment, economic reform and social cohesion are seen as being interrelated. In my opinion, the key conclusion that was reached at that summit was that the European Council will itself adopt an active, guiding and coordinating role. Each spring, our government leaders will discuss the socio-economic policy on the basis of an integrated progress report from the European Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, spring had already started this year. The text for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 had already been drafted, very much along established lines. Why did the Commission not take more time and, in line with Lisbon, draft the guidelines in an interdisciplinary manner, as prepared by the different DGs? Why do we not let the Commission continue with, and further develop, this type of cooperation, which also typified the preparatory work for Lisbon, in a socio-economic field? That seems to me a highly interesting challenge for the Commission’s new Secretary General, David O'Sullivan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would suggest taking into account conclusion 29 of the present report, which advocates a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind economic policy-making to bring it in line with the Lisbon conclusions. I would also like to make reference to the conclusions of this Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, compiled by Mr Cocilovo. He proposes the drawing up of a single annual report on the economic and social state of the Union, and one set of annual guidelines for sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion. One additional suggestion I would like to make is to include the socio-economic forum, which is scheduled for next month, earlier on in the annual cycle, i.e. at the very beginning of the year. At the moment, it is just tacked on at the end. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the consensus-oriented cooperation which we have enjoyed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this sphere and add that we in this Parliament should break though the compartmentalisation and endeavour to rise above the hobbyhorses of this or the other side and to have an input in, for example, next month’s forum, precisely on that basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we reject the overall view. Firstly, it is quite astonishing how ready the other groups are to accept, without criticism, a fairly dogmatic kind of neo-liberalism. Reference is made in the recitals, with evident concern, to the decline in public investment in infrastructure, yet in the conclusions one is expressly warned against an active public investment policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, flexibility, liberalisation and monetarism are the one-sided aspects of this policy. Given that express reference is made to the fact that current economic policy is guided by the objectives of the Stability Pact, and the Commission wants to go further still, then it is obvious that social, cultural and environmental needs will inevitably be sacrificed to this as a matter of principle.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, owing to radical technological change, and I quote: “an overall revision in the conditions of work, remuneration and taxation” is being called for, with no reference to the need to conserve and rejuvenate the social and participatory institutions that have determined the nature and success of the European social model. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as someone has already mentioned, this report talks in terms of a new fetishism for growth. Full employment, and even the transition to the knowledge-based society are thought to be almost exclusively dependent on higher growth. On the other hand, there is no reference whatsoever to the fair distribution of available gainful employment, the realisation of a modern, third economic sector for social, cultural and environmental services, regionalisation of economic cycles, demand-orientated policy, or even the content of a knowledge-based society in social, educational policy and cultural terms. It is evident from the recitals that, for the sake of economic growth, allowance is even made for transgression of the vital Kyoto Agreement on the climate. Now that is what I call scandalous!</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the report advocates further flexibilisation of the financial systems, as opposed to at last getting to grips with the fact that this policy benefits speculative currencies and share operations, and disadvantages real economic investment, which clearly accounts for the structural weakness of investments lamented in the report. In economic policy terms, reason dictates that we should at last think seriously about concepts such as the Tobin tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from a country whose people enjoy the rare privilege of being consulted in connection with such far-reaching decisions as participation in the euro system. Among Danes, there is a great deal of scepticism about, and opposition to, the national currency being swallowed up by the euro. I have no doubt that this scepticism and opposition are shared by large and growing groups of the populations of the other Member States, who are not being consulted. I only have time to mention a couple of points. The first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro. Nobel Prize-winner Franco Modigliani points out that, in his view, unemployment has certainly been used by the European Central Bank as an instrument of economic policy designed to control inflation. This is a crucial point. The other absolutely crucial point I would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution: the political weakness of the euro system. What is missing, of course, is a political superstructure for steering economic policy. This is the background to the French government’s proposal that the EU’s euro system should be equipped with a form of proper economic government. It is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the Danish people’s consent. I can predict that the question of whether or not the euro zone is to be enlarged to include Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain will be decided in Denmark in the referendum on 28 September. The scepticism I have expressed here continues to grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are also level-headed and determined in our approach. We are being level-headed about the prospects, deficits and external value of the euro, and are determined to overcome the deficit vis-à-vis the United States as swiftly and as soon as possible. The deficit stems from the fact that we have a lower level of growth, higher unemployment, lower investment levels, less research and development activity, a slower rate of turnover and a low average income.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is what has led us to draw up a plan comprising a variety of objectives and necessary measures, such as accelerated growth with no capacity bottlenecks or inflationary pressure, preserving price stability in other words, careful wage development, stepping up our efforts in research and development and a further reduction of deficits and debts. We need to continue to pursue structural reform measures, and to do so with courage and determination, and to continue liberalisation, thus reducing the level of state ownership. We need to direct our efforts at creating new jobs, i.e. we need to support the new economy, and we must make the transition to the knowledge-based economy, which can be ascribed to the fact that we need competition when it comes to getting into telecommunications technology in education, training and research. If we go down this path, then, for the first time in years, there is a chance that we could return to full employment in Europe, and that is our goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of its 29 paragraphs, 8 go in for approval and then 4 indulge in self-congratulation. As far as the working population of the countries of the European Union is concerned, there really is not much to be pleased about. What use is the economic growth that the report boasts about, if it is only going to recommend – addressing employees of course – adopting a reasonable attitude in wage negotiations, going so far as to claim that the pension system must be radically revised with a view to protecting their financial position? This is one way of admitting that there is no place in this growth for employed workers or for retired workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the Council and the Commission are acting as spokespersons for big business, asking Parliament to sanction it.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we have not been elected to offer congratulations to governments that come to the assistance of big business and major financial groups in order to enable them to accrue even greater wealth by exacerbating inequalities, leaving 18 million women and men unemployed, making flexibility at work and job instability more widespread, by making swingeing cuts in the total wage bill in order to ensure the continued growth of income from capital, including its most parasitic speculative forms.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is true, as the report states, that we have seen a return to growth, then it is all the more appalling that, throughout Europe, only a tiny minority benefits from it. We shall therefore be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Union’s strategic goal for the forthcoming decade must be to ensure economic growth and free enterprise, without violating the social question, with guidelines based on competitiveness, sustainable development and the creation of new jobs. On the subject of this last point, as the Katiforis report stressed, there has been a slight fall in unemployment in Europe, but unemployment is still unacceptably high, particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people. The situation appears worse in certain regions of Southern Europe, in particular in the South of Italy, where 21.9% of the workforce is unemployed, including 56.6% of the 14-25 age group. Consequently, in my opinion, broad guidelines for economic growth and a rise in employment should include measures to render the European market more competitive and increase job flexibility. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to bring about sustainable growth, we need to finalise creation of the internal market and remove all the remaining barriers by liberalising those sectors which are not yet totally open to free competition, such as transport, gas, electricity and the postal services. We need to introduce the reforms which will have to be implemented by the Member States in order to alleviate the burden on firms, reduce labour costs, sustain actions supporting lifelong learning in the context of a knowledge-based economy and support research to close the gap between Europe and the United States and Japan. We need to facilitate public administration structural reform in the countries where excessive red tape is a barrier to private investment and bring the social protection and taxation systems into line with the requirements imposed by the new economic rules and with the constraints established by the Stability and Growth Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the key concept: a knowledge-based economy in which each and every individual is able to develop his or her talents. It is also central to the combination of innovation and social participation that we intend to use to mobilise society’s full potential and overall assets, so as to achieve full employment again. </p>
<p class="contents">It is the task of the economic policy guidelines to convert this noble aim into concrete policy. However, the Commission’s recommendations are to be found wanting in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">All too often, they are fainthearted and wedded to outmoded ideas, when what they should be doing is developing an outline for a promising new form of policy mix. That is why it is necessary for these guidelines to be improved on, and what we need most of all, in future, is for a joint spring report to be drafted which is capable of properly combining sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion. This must also have a noticeable effect on practical politics.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This will have certain consequences, in two areas in particular. Sustainable economic growth of 3% or more requires a dramatic increase in investment, particularly in environmentally friendly sectors. This applies both to the private and the public sectors. The Commission has a decision to make in this respect. It cannot simultaneously pursue the Lisbon objectives and put the case for a policy of overall tax reductions and expenditure cuts! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are outdated and obsoleted by events and do not contain any prospect of a solution to the extremely serious problems which are both holding back economic development and, in particular, weighing down the citizens. The proposed formulae will lead to ruin: flexibility at all costs, further dismantling of the Welfare State with pension cuts, the imposition of unjustified salary restrictions across the board, and even discrimination between regions, a decrease in public investment and obsessive recourse to the Stability Pact and the monetarism which have not only already caused irreparable harm in the past but have certainly not done anything to support a euro which is yielding increasingly to the supremacy of the dollar. The acclaimed macroeconomic development for job creation is so tied up in the self-regulation of the free market that it has not yet created any jobs, rather it has destroyed stable jobs, while, in the worst of cases, contributing to keeping salaries low in precarious employment sectors. This is not the way to fight unemployment, but it will heighten social poverty, increase the democratic deficit and feed public scepticism towards the democratic institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, together with the broad guidelines for economic policies, other issues have been raised, particularly in relation to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">When speaking of the euro, I would point out two things: firstly, I would ask that the problem be looked at in its entirety, not simply the exchange rate problem. Secondly, I would point out that the Commission’s position remains the same; that is to say, clear growth and price stability must logically lead to an improvement in the euro. This is not an issue we can go into today, but I wanted to make those points.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies. The new broad guidelines differ from previous ones in that they partially incorporate Lisbon. It has been said that they do not incorporate it fully. This is true in the sense that Lisbon is too close to the presentation of the broad guidelines and the bulk of the work had been done previously. Nevertheless, I believe that there were elements prior to Lisbon which anticipated or foresaw what was going to happen there and which have been incorporated into the broad guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have referred to the idea of full employment as a fundamental element. Full employment, according to the Commission’s initial document – which formed the basis of the Lisbon decision – is something which can be achieved as long as the proposed policies are implemented. The problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns. We can put a figure on both our employment objectives as well as on what we take the expression “full employment” to mean, as some of you have suggested. It all depends on what we consider the objectives to be. It is absolutely essential, in speaking of these objectives, that we know whether they are political objectives or whether they represent the possibility of achieving certain economic results, as a consequence of the policies we implement.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have shown a degree of concern about the Commission’s habitual proposals on the flexibility of the labour market. In our view, this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market. It will therefore lead to more employment, but also – as we have always argued – greater quality of employment. This is something we have regularly stressed. The flexibility of the labour market involves many other things: we can talk about regulating working time, but also the removal of all the obstacles which currently stand in the way of employment, such as tax-related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">A major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment. The central element of these broad guidelines for economic policies is trying to increase the European Union’s potential for growth. If we are not capable of doing so, it is blatantly obvious that the current positive growth forecasts of over 3% will only last a relatively short amount of time and this trend will not be allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why public and private investment are absolutely essential. Since 1997, investment has been increasing progressively. By 2001, public and private investment should reach 21% of GDP and, in 2004, it should reach 23%, which would bring us very close to that objective of 24%, which was mentioned in the Commission’s White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise a point here which seems to me to be essential. In my opinion, there is no contradiction between greater investment, greater public investment, and the Stability Pact. On the contrary, I believe that since the Stability Pact has allowed for the rationalisation of public finances, it will bring greater public investment in the future. I agree with the view that, in these new circumstances, an improvement in the quality of public finances must involve greater public investment. This is a point which the Commission has highlighted in the different stability and convergence programmes and, clearly, it is a point which we must continue to stress.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy. This is one of the key elements of the broad guidelines, but I would like to remind you – as I always do – that the main point of the introduction of the new economy is to improve productivity, which is the element which is most likely to bring future growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make an additional comment on two points. Firstly, with regard to the interinstitutional agreement, which has been of concern to the Commission, and secondly, the problems of greater coordination in the face of greater subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the interinstitutional agreement, this is clearly one of Parliament’s recurrent demands. It is also true that its implementation raises legal problems, as well as problems relating to the status of its participants, but I believe that, in any event, we should be satisfied with the progress made this year. I promised you some months ago, when we discussed this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that the Commission would try to make the greatest possible progress with regard to its cooperation with Parliament. It does not take the form of an interinstitutional agreement, but the presentation of the document on the results of the broad guidelines for economic policies, which will permit a prior debate in Parliament, seems to me to be a positive thing. There are other more profound elements, such as the introduction of the idea of broader economic discussions, with the participation of Parliament, and the famous <span class="italic">entretiens économiques</span>, which will, in the future, offer us new opportunities and ideas for our political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Portuguese Presidency’s idea – which we support – of also establishing a debate with Parliament on these issues, not at an institutional level as suggested by Parliament, but of a different nature, is also clearly positive. I believe that this is a good direction to take, and we must continue to cooperate in this regard in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, economic policies are the responsibility of the Member States and, in this respect, subsidiarity is guaranteed. In my opinion, the greatest possible coordination is essential. I therefore argue that we should move ahead with the coordination of economic policies, making reference to the Member States’ obligations. I realise that for some of you this may seem like interference by the Commission in the responsibilities of the Member States, but that is what is laid down in the Treaty, in the legislation which we have created for ourselves, and that is the Commission’s mandate: to make specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that coordination is necessary, but I do not believe that this has to be incompatible with subsidiarity. Greater coordination and greater definition of global policies does not exclude, however, the existence of an additional margin for action on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions, your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
