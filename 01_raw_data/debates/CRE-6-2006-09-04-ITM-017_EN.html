In particular I should like to thank the President for his intervention in this case with the Libyan authorities at the beginning of July.</p>

<p class="contents">Reports from recent meetings indicate that the retrial will be concluded within a few months. We have heard that before. Three months have passed already, and this has been going on since 1999. I should like to call upon the Commission and the Council – and again upon you, Mr President – to redouble diplomatic efforts with the Libyan authorities in order to bring this matter to a speedy and just conclusion, with the immediate release of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor.</p>

It seems to have been forgotten that, following its victory in the election, the Direction – Social Democracy Party (Smer) formed a government coalition with the extreme right Slovak National Party (SNS). At the beginning of August, this red-brown coalition gained the support of the members of the Slovak Parliament. In July, I took the opportunity to express my concern and disapproval regarding this coalition, which are shared by many of my fellow Members, but the Prime Minister, Mr Fico, did not follow up on our request to reconsider whether such a coalition was appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, recent events have shown that our concerns were well-founded. Members of the Hungarian minority were recently attacked for speaking Hungarian, and the leader of the SNS, Mr Slota, has continued to make xenophobic and nationalistic speeches. By agreeing to this coalition, Mr Fico has left the door open to such outbursts, and there is a fine line between words and actions. Politicians need to demonstrate responsibility; making alliances with extremists who hold these kinds of views will necessarily have harmful consequences. For me, the violence we are seeing today is a cruel reminder of the darkest days of Europe’s pre-war history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such organisations and foundations have become quite common throughout the states of the former empire. By using its favourable situation in the global energy market, Russia is able to allocate more funds for propaganda campaigns. To this purpose, a special Euroregion Livonia-Baltic foundation has already been established with representative offices in Estonia, Latvia, Belarus and the Kaliningrad region. The official aims of this foundation include promoting business relations and cultural cooperation between the Baltic States, the Kaliningrad region, Belarus and Ukraine. However, the founders of the foundation initiated by Russia are already known for their blatant actions against the construction of spent-fuel storage facilities at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The EU, while encouraging democratic processes in the post-soviet countries, is jeopardising its initiative in the information war. I have already invited the European Parliament, and I am doing so again, to more actively promote the democratic process in the post-soviet countries and clearly express its opinion on the anti-western propaganda in the EU’s eastern neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Take the Swedish nuclear power station, Forsmark. The person formerly responsible for security there, Lars-Olov Höglund, has said of this power station that it was pure luck that it did not go into meltdown at the beginning of this August. He calls the situation the most dangerous since Chernobyl. It was also a week before either the Swedish public or operators of similar power stations in other countries were made aware of the event.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, details of the safety of nuclear power stations and of the requirements imposed on them by the authorities are not available to the public. That this is the case in Sweden’s otherwise very open society is, of course, also somewhat alarming. There is a lack of information where nuclear power is concerned. The important lesson to be learned from this episode is that nuclear power is not safe and never will be. It creates huge problems and, to top it all, undermines democracy. We must ensure that we put a stop to this development as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ján Slota asserted his anti-Hungarian and anti-Roma views with impunity during the election campaign in Slovakia this spring more and more vociferously, a fact which we have drawn attention to on a number of occasions. This widely known nationalist party leader, who is deliberately inciting anti-Roma sentiments among the Slovak population with his unconstitutional and prejudiced utterances, has already taken up his duties as a member of the Slovak Government, as a coalition partner. Similar utterances during Meciar's government had almost irreversible consequences for Slovakia's Roma population.</p>
<p class="contents">According to estimates, there are currently 800 000 Roma living in Slovakia under very difficult social and economic circumstances. The most important task facing the country and the government is to put an end to the Roma’s exclusion. However, they fail to do so. The current political atmosphere is justifiably frightening and uncertain for the Roma population and other minorities living in Slovakia, who suffer direct or indirect prejudice every day.

The incidents involved physical assaults and offensive insults written on banners at a sporting event. For example, a young woman from the Hungarian minority was brutally beaten for speaking on her mobile phone in Hungarian. These cruel acts have shocked the Slovakian-Hungarian public, as there have been no such atrocities over the last eight years. These alarming outrages against the minorities are completely against the European Union’s ethics and principles, which Slovakia guaranteed to abide by when it joined the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union there is no room for acts that threaten the peaceful coexistence of minorities, especially if these acts are incited by governments or politicians. I ask that we take steps together against the extreme anti-minority remarks made by certain members of the Slovakian Government so that they do not provoke any more aggressive incidents.

Finland was the first country in the world in which all women had the right both to vote and to be elected. One hundred years later, more than a third of members of parliament are women, and women hold 40% of ministerial positions. In many other European countries, however, the situation is not very good. In Estonia, for instance, where women were granted full suffrage in 1918, still only one fifth of members of parliament are women, and women hold only every seventh ministerial position – that is, 14%. One of the reasons for this inequality is that voters cannot find suitable female candidates on the voting lists. On lists of candidates, the first ten names still include only one or two women. I call upon my colleagues throughout Europe to ensure that in their home countries there are an equal number of women and men among the candidates for parliament.

<p class="contents">The press release actually claims: ‘The European Union plots to wipe Britain off the map’. It alleges that Britain is to be broken up into a series of transnational regions and will no longer exist. If you look at the references it transpires that the so-called plot is nothing more than the old Interreg regions – the regional cooperation between different regions with similar problems, such as the Atlantic regions. Presumably if they saw a geological map of Europe, they would claim that Scotland was being merged with Austria because they both have granite, or that the different limestone areas were being merged into transnational regions.</p>

In the last two months, three TV teams of Greek Cypriot journalists were arrested, kept for several days in atrocious prison conditions and brought before a Turkish military court, accused of filming in a supposedly military area. The occupied town of Famagusta is arbitrarily regarded by the Turkish army as such an area.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been found guilty in summary proceedings, the journalists were heavily fined. In a commendable gesture of solidarity, the fines were paid by Turkish Cypriot journalists who themselves suffer similar treatment by the Turkish army. I call upon you as the President of this House to express to the Turkish Government your deep concern and strong condemnation of these arrests, which constitute a blatant attempt to severely curtail freedom of expression in an EU Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the European Union has commenced surveillance patrols in the sea in the vicinity of the Canary Islands, we are still waiting for patrols in the Mediterranean to start, as had been promised. Libya has up till now been sceptical about these patrols, but today we heard the news that it is prepared to reconsider its position, provided the Europe Union provides assistance with the guarding of Libya’s southern frontiers. This is a positive development, Mr President, and I hope it will lead to the launch of these patrols as soon as possible as well as to the commencement of a battle against organised crime. Organised crime is exploiting these immigrants and causing serious problems to countries affected by illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These terrorist attacks would have had devastating consequences for the lives of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people. The discovery was shocking and caused inconveniences for other passengers whose flights had to be cancelled for security reasons. I would also like to thank the passengers and airport staff for their cooperation and disciplined behaviour in the ensuing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that ultimately we all understand and are grateful for this discovery, and for the fact that the police subsequently arrested and are now prosecuting the suspects. This gives us a certain sense of security for the future, a security which was shaken on 11 September 2001 and remains so to this day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our thoughts turn to the need to ensure that no young people are left in third countries who do not know how read and write their language.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, with its development aid, is participating in global efforts to eradicate illiteracy. However, there is also internal illiteracy. In coordinating their efforts, the Member States and the European institutions are helping education for which the Member States have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not underestimate the value of maintaining the linguistic and cultural identity of the children of migrant European workers. Just as constantly improved European schools need to be run for the children of people working for the European institutions, coordinated care and institutionalised obligations are needed for other internal migrants, in order to maintain their linguistic and cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies and distance learning help and the European index of language skills must not be limited to five languages; it must include all the official European languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I knew him as Director-General for Transport and Energy. His door was always open. He was always curious to hear people’s views, to give advice and to express his opinion. His lucidity and intelligence, his professional standards and rigour, his complete consistency, and even the impertinence of the most lucid: he offered us one of the best examples of a vocation for European public service, based on a federalist, Europeanist and genuinely progressive conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe to him the fact that the Delors White Paper became a reality in the trans-European networks, and also, irony of ironies, the opening up of the rail sector under the best possible circumstances, the Galileo project, the motorways of the sea and the current logistics project. It is very sad that he did not have time to draw up and implement a European energy policy. The one we get will not be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to him now, just at a time when we are going to need him most. I am sure that he would have been smiling from behind the lenses of his glasses if he had known the controversy and the Europeanist revision that his absence is causing.</p>
<p class="contents">As a tribute to him, I believe that we must continue working hard to achieve more progress and more Europe, a Europe that genuinely serves the common interest.</p>
