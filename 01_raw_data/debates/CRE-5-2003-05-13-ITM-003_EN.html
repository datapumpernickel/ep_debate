Indeed, it is necessary for Community legislation to be further adapted in view of current issues, the challenges posed by enlargement, local situations and constantly developing technology. The object is to maintain the legal certainty of law on the territory of the Union by means of greater involvement and dynamism on the part of economic and social operators.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the backdrop to the issue of environmental agreements. I support the line taken by the Commission, which makes a distinction between two types of environmental agreement<span class="bold"> </span>and, having made a number of amendments, I fully acknowledge the usefulness of these instruments to supplement regulatory measures, to be used only with a view to making improvements in the environmental field with a scope equal to or broader than those to be obtained by means of traditional legislative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty does not contain any specific provision concerning environmental agreements. Such instruments must therefore be used in full compliance with all the provisions of the Treaty and the Community's international commitments. The basic structure of Community policy on the environment is and has always been legislative provisions, which in only a few specific cases may be combined with voluntary agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting the opinion on which we are about to vote, taking account of the debate held on the subject and Parliament's positions, I felt that a number of clarifications and guarantees still needed to be included before the instruments mentioned in the Communication could be considered to be acceptable and genuinely practicable. Five binding preliminary conditions are identified in particular, which I will now summarise briefly. Firstly, I tried to make the concept of voluntary agreements as instruments for integrating Community legislation more<span class="bold"> </span>explicit.<span class="bold"> </span>Secondly, I called for upstream definition of the sectors which might be the subject of voluntary agreements, through both coregulation and self-regulation instruments. New regulatory instruments should, in fact, be used on the basis of a common reference framework showing, from the outset, the intention to use voluntary agreements in that specific sector. The specific intention to use a voluntary agreement should be mentioned in the Commission's annual work programme, or in documents with broader scope, such as White Papers or Thematic Strategies. Thirdly, I proposed further analysis of the assessment criteria needed for correct use of environmental agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that, in order to guarantee the transparency and effectiveness of voluntary instruments, it is necessary to define the conditions of application and verify the implementing procedures. As stressed earlier, the objectives of the agreement – defined within a legislative reference framework or set out in a Commission recommendation – must, in any case, entail obligations for the parties concerned. Failure to respect or achieve the objectives laid down would trigger recourse to supplementary legislative mechanisms or the replacement of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, the distinction between coregulation and self-regulation is appreciated here. In the first case, the instruments have to be included in a binding legal framework giving the Council and Parliament the right to participate and adopt objectives, providing for public access and participation and introducing effective monitoring and sanction mechanisms. In the second case, the Commission's role may be to stimulate or encourage, by means of a recommendation, or to recognise, by means of an exchange of letters with the representatives of the sectors concerned. Whatever the choice of instrument, Parliament and the Council retain their power to scrutinise the results achieved and the possibility of using typical legislative instruments at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these bases, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has improved and endorsed, we give the green light to the Commission so that, in the sectors mentioned, first and foremost the PVC sector, we can start to put this mix of legislation and voluntary commitments to the practical test. We have enhanced and rearranged the tool box: now let us all use it to the full! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the overall positive tone of the report and the motion for a resolution. The report broadly endorses the approach set out by the Commission in its communication. I am particularly pleased that Parliament explicitly recognises environmental agreements as a useful complement to legislative measures. I reconfirm the Commission's commitment to making use of voluntary agreements at Community level on a selective case-by-case basis only, checking them against the criteria laid down in the communication and respecting procedural requirements that ensure proper involvement of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My only regret is that the legitimate concerns of Parliament to exert its democratic control have resulted, in some points, in a call for control requirements that are not in balance with the voluntary nature of the instrument. It is important to satisfy the need for transparency and control on the one hand without, on the other hand, discouraging economic actors from taking up the instrument of environmental agreements by imposing excessive requirements. The Commission will make the choice between self-regulation and co-regulation on the basis of an ad hoc assessment of the individual agreement, the legal context and the policy issue at stake. It would not make sense to define general abstract criteria to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already indicated, imposing ambitious monitoring requirements on spontaneous agreements that are not formally acknowledged by the Commission appears to be overly burdensome and a real disincentive for industry to come forward with such agreements. The Commission proposed general rules on impact assessment in its communication of 5 June 2002. It would not make sense to go beyond the requirements imposed on legislative acts when it comes to environmental agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that our tentative list of policy areas in which the instrument could be used meets with your agreement. I also appreciate the suggestion that environmental agreements could be used in the sectors defined in the action plan set out by the Johannesburg world summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to emphasise that I consider Parliament's resolution an overall positive signal that will contribute to facilitating the use of environmental agreements under transparent and acceptable conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also relatively happy with Mr Sacconi’s report. My only criticism of your report and of a number of the amendments submitted by Mr De Roo concerns the comments that Mrs Wallström also made.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say the following: there is now a new instrument that has two kinds of voluntary agreements. One is based on legislation in the form of co-regulation; you can build on that, things can happen more quickly, we do not have to prescribe everything straight away. The second suggestion that now appears in the new memorandum is completely voluntary self-regulation in which partners in the market agree something with each other which may anticipate what will be agreed at some point in the future. This is based on voluntariness.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel – and this has just been expressed by Mrs Wallström – that anxiety is often the worst adviser in this Parliament, that we prescribe so much and that we are becoming so detailed that we are in the process of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, although we should be pleased with the large number of agreements there are.</p>
<p class="contents">May I perhaps say – Christian democracy being the midfield defender incarnate in my country – that very many things would not have happened without voluntariness. Take the packaging covenant, for example. That is a voluntary agreement that goes much further than the one that the most extreme would like to achieve now on a European level. It is a voluntary agreement. Give a clear field to voluntariness, I would say. Let it take the place of the instrument, if it must. Mr Sacconi, that is why I am asking everyone to approve the amendment that I have submitted on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the PVC strategy. We could have achieved much more if this Parliament – including the liberals, incidentally – had said at the time: we are now going to ask the Commission to develop a new policy together with industry which will enable them to energetically go about ensuring – and in fact you were the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi – that that PVC is used up. The same applies to pedestrian safety. We could prevent 2 000 deaths a year if we act quickly. I would like to ask for the other group to be allowed more leeway and to be trusted. I am in favour of a good environmental policy. All of us here are; please make sure it is a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is as if their role is to find a path to improved legislation. Perhaps when the results of voluntary agreements are analysed, they will lead to new laws that will go further with regard to environmental issues than is presently the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Operators that are prepared to participate in these voluntary agreements may be regarded as pilots of a sort. At the level of business this will also mean that when there is the willingness to start looking for better applications, companies can then take advantage of this in their own marketing strategies, which hopefully will lead to a situation where consumers will also start demanding these better applications on a wider scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking everything into consideration, however, we have to ensure that these voluntary agreements actually yield results and do not just remain a pious hope. For that reason, we really have to make sure that we can measure the results precisely and that there are certain deadlines by which time results must have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many operators at regional and local level, besides companies, that have been interested in concluding voluntary agreements. In this connection, we have to make sure that if the party to an agreement operates at regional level, then central level is also informed about what is taking place, in order to avoid overlapping and so that we can ensure as far as possible that the benefits are realised, and also answer questions on financing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole I think these voluntary agreements provide added value, but with the provisos that are also linked to the Commission proposal, that is to say, we have to improve legislation, not replace it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although in theory, voluntary environmental agreements are to be applauded, reality has shown that, precisely because they are voluntary, many of these agreements are ultimately not observed and, furthermore, have frequently been used as a pretext for not bringing into force more ambitious legally binding initiatives.</p>

I therefore believe it is greatly to be welcomed that the Commission has taken the initiative to define clear rules for recognising voluntary agreements at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are some rules that must be respected: first of all, the voluntary agreements must be seen only as a complement to environmental policy and not as a basis for it; secondly, they must be used only when they are proven to have advantages over conventional instruments; thirdly, they must be promoted only in cases where they attempt to go further than traditional legislation; fourthly, they must be geared towards technological research and be based on benchmarking criteria: it makes no sense to have voluntary agreements that do not promote the best technologies. Lastly, there must be deadlines, timetables, clearly defined targets and mechanisms for monitoring results and ensuring compliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that I think that voluntary agreements are important but that it is also important we be clear about which conditions must be fulfilled if the agreements are to be beneficial, in environmental terms too. On this, I completely agree with what Mr de Silva said, to the effect that the environmental agreements can only be supplementary in areas in which they can be used to bring about improvements, or added value, in the environmental sphere, and that they should not just be used to avoid environmental regulation in a particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is important that the objectives and deadlines be carefully specified in connection with the agreements and that they also be sure to cover a representative sample of the relevant businesses and production in the area in question, so that one group of businesses is not given the opportunity to freewheel.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that complete openness in relation to the public, to this Parliament, to the environmental organisations and to civil society is also important. There must be openness in connection with plans to enter into the environmental agreements, but also considerable scope for objecting to the use of environmental agreements in a specific area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important, in connection with the agreements, that a monitoring and penalties system be established so that it can in actual fact be monitored whether the agreements, and objectives laid down in those agreements, are also being fulfilled during the periods of the agreements. In my own country, Denmark, too, we have experimented with environmental agreements in some areas, for example the PVC area, in which there was not enough in terms of provisions governing monitoring and penalties. It emerged, when the period had elapsed, that absolutely nothing had happened in terms of improving the use of PVC materials. It is therefore very important that these matters be clarified in connection with entering into environmental agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this special thanks go to my colleague, Mr Sacconi.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedback hitherto on environmental agreements has shown that a significant number of environmental and civil society players have viewed voluntary agreements with suspicion, even when the act of making the agreement in itself has been voluntary (although the agreement itself is binding). On the other hand, it has been the wish of industry to spread the practice of making voluntary agreements in order to achieve positive results from the point of view of flexibility, and so also, hopefully, that of the environment. As I see it, the gap is now becoming well and truly bridged.</p>
<p class="contents">The report works on the assumption that voluntary agreements may be applied when the impact can be assessed using an integrated method and the added value for civil society can be measured using indicators of sustainable development. Secondly, we have to be able to define our objectives and set clear deadlines for them. In addition, we must insist on the agreement being representative. In practice this would mean that badly organised sectors or those that provide opportunities for ‘free riding’ would not be suitable for inclusion in any voluntary agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With voluntary agreements it is just as necessary as it is with legislative measures to take account of public participation and to guarantee the transparency of agreements. In addition we must ensure the binding nature of any agreement, the assessment of results and possible penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">With these conditions in place there is no risk attached to the use of voluntary agreements. The conditions mentioned will guarantee that an agreement will produce a better end result than legislative instruments, from the point of view of the environment and society. I must also therefore say that the amendment proposed by my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure for concluding an agreement generally instils a sense of genuine commitment to the objective in the party to that agreement. It often goes deeper than the wording of the agreement or the letter of the law. Thus, operators will not be using up their resources looking for loopholes; instead, they will be seeking ways to effectively implement the objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
