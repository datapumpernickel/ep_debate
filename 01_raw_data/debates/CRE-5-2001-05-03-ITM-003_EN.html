This is an own-initiative report by the Industry Committee and therefore it is a privilege to work on what are a relatively select number of these reports and to be the custodian on behalf of my committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the colleagues who have contributed to this report and those who helped me in industry and in the Commission to make sure that we covered the ground thoroughly. I was pleased that the final report reflected all those contributions and was adopted unanimously by the committee. I hope that it will get the same level of support from the House today. This report sends a strong political signal to the Commission and Council that this Parliament wants this crucial area – the evolution of the Next Generation of Internet and electronic communication – to be reflected in the crucial decisions on research support that are about to made in the context of the Framework Six Programme. I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the three key questions that I tried to answer in my report: Why is this so important? Why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you? What do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it?</p>
<p class="contents">First I think the strategic importance of electronic communications and the Internet are increasingly well understood by everyone in this House. But what is the contribution for Commission and publicly-funded research? This report argues that there is a strong case for supporting pre-competitive work in the next stages of the evolution of this technology and that pre-competitive work will underlie the future competitiveness of all the industries and service providers who are engaged in this crucial business, and governments as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of the GSM standard in mobile telecommunications, we have seen how important pre-competitive work is in setting in place the standards, protocols, and architecture for the next and evolving stage of communications. It is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context? We need to anticipate the technologies that will be needed in a world where the capacity of the whole distribution system for electronic communications is going to be far larger than it is today. That investment is going in now and will continue to go in, so we should plan for a world with a very large amount of bandwidth capacity: that is the jargon we would use for saying the carrying-capacity of the wires or the airwaves that are communicating users to users and users with service suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">The architecture that we should develop will be very different from the architecture we have today where carrying-capacity is constrained. One of the core areas proposed in this report is to ensure that we use the research network that the Commission is already funding – the Géant network – to use that effectively by supporting projects that will exploit that very high carrying-capacity research network in anticipation of the whole infrastructure evolution that in future will be driven by the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the core of the system architecture, but alongside that there are other public policy areas where we want to do research. Issues of security and data protection are clearly important. They are becoming more and more important as our personal data are so easily and quickly circulated. It is also becoming more important because, in the wireless connected world, we will increasingly have more devices feeding information about ourselves, houses and cars into the system.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a new type of personal data that is being used in a benign way to monitor the operation of our car and the security systems in our house, but if somebody could accumulate and collect that data it would be a far from benign use of it. Data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently, encapsulating data together so it cannot be amalgamated in an unauthorised way.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to think about the new opportunities afforded by wireless technologies, how the amount of information carried in our personal devices or mobile phones can be used in commercial transactions, but also about carrying our health records around with us in case of emergency and about areas where highly confidential data will be distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to think about the new products that will allow wireless technology to carry things like video broadcasts, access to streamed broadcasts that could be passing through and around us: how, for example, could we access our local television station wherever we are in the world, and how would we pay for that? That technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just sketched out the 'what' areas of my three questions, so let me conclude by saying 'how' we would like to move this forward. This is a contribution to the debate on research policy in Framework Six Programme and our vote today will enable that to move at exactly the right time into the ongoing strategic discussion process. We need to ask the Commission, in taking this forward, to look at building a network of excellence around these technologies. Although this is one of the areas contained in the Commission's plans, it is clearly a priority for this particular field of technology. We are also looking for the sort of integrated projects involving the public and private sector that the Commission envisages in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I warmly commend this report to the House today and I would just emphasise again the importance that Parliament attaches to ensuring that the Commission takes this forward in its future strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not just flattering him, I really mean it. My congratulations on his report which contains both a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission initiatives and many of his own suggestions. I should also like to thank him for his open-minded attitude to our positions, suggestions and proposed amendments. Similar thanks go to the Commission, which really has proven over recent years that it is able to start its own European initiatives in an extremely important sector and implement them internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to deal here with opponents – perhaps I should say partners at international level rather than opponents – who are very very strong in this sector, especially the United States. It is becoming more and more important for us to come up with our own ideas on what future prospects we want to give the Internet sector as a whole. So heartfelt thanks to the Commission – and the Council – on their innovation-friendly approach to this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pick up on a few points addressed by Malcolm Harbour. This initiative is concerned primarily with what should happen in the area of future research on the Internet. I think it is important here to progress beyond the Commission’s previous initiatives and anticipate the future. Malcolm Harbour mentioned this.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean, anticipating the future in the Internet sector? It is tough terrain because forecasts are hard to make in both this and many other sectors. Here, however, we are dealing with a sector which is moving very very fast, which is regulated but where it is increasingly important that we look ahead and decide what standards will be needed in the future. The other question which keeps cropping up is exactly how this sector is perceived and understood by the people, by consumers as a whole. It is becoming more and more important here to create real confidence, so that we do not just have the technology, which is fantastic, we do not just have clever and intelligent regulation, we do not just have standards which anticipate the future, we also have people and consumers who are ready and willing to invest in this sector, not just by making telephone calls, but by using it in future to conduct their transactions. We shall need to invest much much more in this sector than we have done in the past. If we are to create real confidence, I should like to call on the Commission to do more here.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, my request, my plea to the Commission is this: please bundle all the initiatives which you have started in the Internet sector into a single, cross-sectoral initiative with a real, overall, conclusive concept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which culminated in this own initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is too little investment in ICT across the entire European Union, both by industry and by the government. Take, for example, the sixth Framework Programme: EUR 3.6 billion has been earmarked for ICT, but that is far too little. For let us consider what is needed to turn Europe into the world’s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, as was agreed in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need a good infrastructure, of course, and I am taking a wide-angled view on this. Based on my liberal belief, this does not, of course, primarily require government involvement. At European level, however, there is naturally a need for a high-speed, trans-European research network, and that is where the European Union comes in a big way, as my fellow MEP pointed out a moment ago. I would urge the Commissioner to show more ambition in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for good quality content. Once again, the lack of capital is a huge barrier, especially to innovation. The content sector consists of fledgling companies and medium-sized companies that wish to export, and due to the turbulence on the market, there is little willingness to provide risk capital. Moreover, Europe displays strong regional differences in the supply of capital. This situation puts Europe at a disadvantage compared to the United States, where three to four times more risk capital is being invested in digital content and in Internet-related activities.</p>
<p class="contents">That now leads to innovation, more economic growth and, obviously, to employment. The public sector should play a more significant role in improving the situation by combining supply and demand in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, for the first time in history, technology is driving constitutional law. That is why I am asking the Commissioner why the topic “citizens and governance in the European knowledge-based society”, for which EUR 225 million has been earmarked in the sixth Framework Programme, does not fall within the same category as “technologies in the information society”.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the government itself will also need to adjust to the information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is important, above all, to give as many people as possible the means to communicate freely with whomever they wish, as and how they please. People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information. This alone brings us up against the main obstacle to this free network, to free communication. There has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence. However, I think that this expression alone is most telling. Consumer confidence means simply wanting to create confidence so that consumers believe that communications are secure. Privacy is a different concept; it means that communications really are secure, which is why I should like to stress again that privacy should be the real objective, i.e. really guaranteeing that communications are secure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one obstacle: monitoring is being driven further and further forward, including at European level. It is often argued that there are now new Internet crimes or old crimes which are now being committed over the Internet. However, the measures being taken in response are based on the belief that these crimes can be contained using state monitoring methods – as if. At the same time, most measures are only able to frighten off the really stupid offenders. They will not do much more than that because most of those who commit crimes in cyberspace also know how to protect themselves against monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of data protection is addressed in Articles 10 and 13 of the report. However, it is partly restricted by calling for protection for data with financial or health implications alone. I think privacy is important for all data. Everyone has the right to choose for themselves in matters of information, which is why our slogan should be: down with monitoring, up with privacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of, and access to, new modern telecommunication facilities. However, any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced. It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas. This commitment to universal access for urban and rural areas must be intrinsically included in policies pursued by various telecom regulators operating in the marketplace. New technology can contribute enormously to the implementation of effective rural development policy, and it will be a key factor in the creation of vital new employment in rural areas and in addressing the problem of the urban/rural imbalance which is a priority issue for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection, David Byrne, in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet. Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development. It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should not be technology, but the user’s need that plays a key role in this. The Harbour report, however, is very technology-led.</p>
<p class="contents">The public task consists of more than providing infrastructure. The rapporteur failed to mention that the government also has the task of finding out how the new Internet can benefit the public.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, technology can contribute to greater social cohesion, for example due to the fact that the replacement of standard activities leaves more time for human contact. As this will not happen of its own accord, we need to look into the applications that could strengthen social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, legislation on safety and content is insufficiently highlighted. Safe infrastructure is important, but technology often does not rule out incorrect use. Consequently, the rapporteur should have had more consideration for the international implications of new technology and for existing and new legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to narrow the knowledge gap, it is necessary for all groups of the population to be able to learn to use new technology. The needs, conditions and infrastructure required must be identified for weak groups. In that way, the integration of new technology can take place as early as at the development stage of new applications. Specific groups can then receive additional support.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, the applications deserve more consideration than is evident in this report. More emphasis on the listed policy aspects is required if we want to create a knowledge-based society which involves the entire population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The degree of support for the report is indicated both by the fact that it was adopted unanimously in committee, and by the fact that there are no amendments. The House certainly appears to be fully in support.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Socialist Group, we particularly support the high priority given to making sure that we include in the Sixth Framework Programme work on the Next Generation Internet, and that we develop a broad-banded infrastructure capability and a new super fast trans-European research network. We want to make sure that EU research initiatives complement market-driven research, thereby avoiding conflict or duplication.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, at least four areas that are in need of clarification: first, in paragraph 2, we talk about the need for pre-competitive research. We agree that it should be pre-competitive, not uncompetitive, which may be a different term. The model we see is the Japanese model on research cartels where people work together during the development of a new technology before they go off and compete with each other when it gets close to the marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in paragraph 7, we talk about it being technologically neutral. That is fine, provided that is not an excuse for inaction where we wait for the technology to be determined. We need to feed into that process and be flexible, but we also need to be active.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly on system security, it is clear that we need to be able to protect this Internet generation, and the next one, in terms of enabling people to engage in cash transactions and to transmit confidential information. I hope that the Commission will look at both the technology and the legislation that is needed to ensure that the necessary levels of encryption can be put in place to protect the public, without aiding the criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the key issues of universal access. The Commission will have to ensure that we achieve this and that it is available to everybody, and not just those living in urban areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report also addresses the fact that the society of the future will be a mobile Internet society, and I believe that we Members are, in a way, guinea pigs as regards whether or not this mobility will work.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also shows the rapid rate of change that we are seeing in this area, the points of departure for the capital market being among the things that have changed since Mr Harbour’s work was completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing that I would like to say to the Commissioner today is that I hope that the Commission’s organisation is sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of the need for cooperation between its different areas and to be able to react quickly to the changes required. I also feel that account must be taken of this issue in the White Paper on European Governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Better coordination of the Commission’s activities is needed, as Mrs Mann also mentioned.

<p class="contents">One point always needs underlining. The kind of research needed here will include scientific research – research in physics, research in IT – but will also include socio-economic and legal research because of the points covered, particularly in paragraph 13, where we are dealing with these vital issues of privacy and data protection. We will need to make sure that we have the regulatory mechanisms right and deal properly with the risks and threats as well as getting the technological fixes done correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also underline a point arising out of Clause 9 which Mr Hyland made: I am just back from a visit to the Outer Hebrides during the constituency week. We can, with these technologies, cancel the disadvantages of the periphery and we can therefore turn round the age-old tendency of depopulation of our remote areas provided that we make available, for example, abundant low-cost expanded high band-breadth infrastructures with access on equitable terms.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for his excellent initiative. The Commission very much appreciates the continued interest which the European Parliament and its Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed in the development and establishment of an information society in Europe. Indeed, in drawing up its reports on the Next Generation Internet, the industry committee has given a clear indication of the vital importance of the future development of this networking infrastructure. The timing of the foreseen adoption of this report is very well chosen since the Commission is currently preparing the forthcoming communication of specific programmes implementing the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in which issues included in Mr Harbour's report will be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Generation Internet, will be realised through developments in both technology and policy. For Europe to remain competitive, it is first of all imperative to ensure a rapid and continued growth of the Internet as the key infrastructure for the global knowledge economy. It is equally important for new policy measures to be taken as required in order to cope with the rapidly evolving development of the Internet world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of instruments and resources – e-Europe, European research areas, the RGD Framework Programme, e-content, Ten Telecom, structural funds – to ensure a rapid development of the Next Generation Internet. Appropriate coordination of our activities with those of the Member States and other European institutions will ensure that ambitious targets are pursued to the benefit of all Europeans and that access to new services is guaranteed also to those with special needs such as the disabled and the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">As the main instrument available in Europe, the Framework Programme will support the research towards the development of the Next Generation Internet. That work is already being supported through the current Fifth Framework Programme and will be strengthened in the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give some examples of our support to the Next Generation Internet: first, a strategic initiative on the IBV6, the next generation protocol, has recently been launched by the Commission and an industry-led task force has been created. This will contribute to the rapid and continued evolution of the Internet and will also ensure that Europe's competitiveness in wireless technologies is not jeopardised in the long-term. Moreover, through IBV6, Europe will be ready to provide the required connectivity to those billions of devices that will constitute the nervous system of the future information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, significant success towards the deployment of new electronic infrastructures has been achieved through the Géant project, a pan-European network covering both EU and associated countries. Thirdly, the Commission takes good note of Parliament's call to be more ambitious in implementing the Géant project, as various Members have just indicated. The aim is to provide highly advanced connectivity and services in Europe's national research and education networks at a level that allows them to play a leading role in cutting-edge research allowing the Géant to involve from 2.5 gigabits to 10 gigabits per second and thereafter to 100 gigabits per second in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, playing a central role in global cooperation with similar regional activities world-wide, for example the Internet II initiative in the United States, CANET4 in Canada and so on, Géant will provide the multiplier effect from which major infrastructural projects benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Sixth Framework Programme for RTD, and of course our continuous liberalisation of telecommunication markets, the Commission is seeking to ensure that the infrastructure needed to support development of Next Generation Internet services in Europe is available. It will directly support the research needed to allow development of new technologies in areas such as photonics, advanced software and hardware, and interfaces etc. Those research activities have to address important new requirements among which enhanced security plays a prime role. The security issues will also be tackled in the upcoming communication on security of electronic networks that should be presented in time for the Gothenburg European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me stress that we are in full agreement with Mr Harbour and with his report in considering that the Next Generation Internet is strategically important to Europe. We have a unique opportunity ahead of us to develop a networking infrastructure for the benefit of the research community and the European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
