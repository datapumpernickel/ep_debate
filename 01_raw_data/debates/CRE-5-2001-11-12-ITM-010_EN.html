<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vander Taelen (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as soon as I became a Member of this Parliament two and a half years ago, I asked Commissioner Reding what she intended to do about the precarious situation European cinema found itself in. As a film-maker, I have always wondered how long Europe would put up with the systematic decline of what is, after all, a substantial part of our cultural heritage. Indeed, in the 60s, European films still accounted for 60% of the supply in Europe. Nowadays, that percentage has unfortunately dropped to 22%. That is an all-time low. European films only obtain 26% of their income from outside their own countries. That is certainly far too low. The trade deficit with the US has therefore increased to, and I happily quote this figure because it is so enormous, EUR 6 829 million. This is a gigantic sum, and we should certainly be able to reduce Europe’s trade deficit vis-à-vis America.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, Europe makes more, and perhaps even better, films than America, although that is very much a matter of opinion. However, the fact that it is so difficult to watch a film from another European country in one’s own country is an outright scandal. It is exceptionally difficult to watch a Spanish film in Greece, or to watch an Italian film in the Netherlands, barring a few exceptions. However, I do believe that it would bear witness to outmoded short-sightedness to call for a large-scale injection of funding into European cinema. In my opinion, Europe has sufficient muscle, creative muscle, muscle by actors and authors but also by sponsors, to make European cinema rise from the ashes. That is why European cinema requires no subsidies. We simply need the resources and the environment to be able to work in a creative manner once again. That is why I call for a very ambitious European project.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we must first of all identify the fundamental weakness of European film, which is certainly not on a creative but rather on a financial plane. It is exceptionally difficult for European businesses that are willing to invest in European film to obtain bank guarantees, for example, in order to cover the risk of their investments. This is much less of a problem in America on account of the huge financial capacity of the studios. That is why we are witnessing a kind of capital flight from Europe to America. We must try to buck this trend. I think we can expect the European Investment Bank to help us in this by acting as guarantor for banks which, in turn, wish to help those who want to invest in Europe. This funding is required to provide European producers with the necessary resources to reinforce the European film and to eliminate its weaknesses – and I am talking here about the lack of development.</p>
<p class="contents">European films are not being developed sufficiently. Americans deliberate longer and work longer on films before they are launched. We lack the resources to do this. We can also learn a great deal from the Americans in terms of advertising. Even if we have the expertise, we lack the funding to carry out their promotion and marketing strategies. I am convinced that if we can support the producers in this, the situation could change. I also think that we should, for example, consider Structural Funds. These can be used to strengthen smaller cinemas in less developed areas. This is virgin territory at the moment. I would appreciate it if the Commission were to give this matter some thought.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to talk about the way we will be protecting our heritage. It is unfortunate that many films are lost. The memory of European cinema is being lost. Europe should be ambitious in this respect because it is very important to our children’s education that young people can watch these films. I will wind up my speech here, for I have made some thirty recommendations in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the very constructive manner in which we have worked together and I hope, therefore, that this will culminate in approval tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very glad to be able to do so, and congratulate the rapporteur. It is not that often that we have somebody speaking here who is as knowledgeable about his subject as is Mr Vander Taelen, who is a film-maker himself. So, well done, my dear Mr Vander Taelen.</p>
<p class="contents">I think your report really does provide much needed impetus. As you said, the market share of European films in the cinemas of the European Union is at an historic low point of only 22.5%. The dominance of the American film industry is also reflected in the grossly excessive trade deficit of EUR 6.8 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the acceding countries is even more dramatic. There is another problem, apart from the clear dominance of films from the USA, which we must not draw a veil over. We often talk in this House of our desire to promote European films, but many are thinking only of their own national film industry and not of their neighbour's, whose films, European films, are not seen in neighbouring regions often enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council as well, must, as a matter of urgency, at last produce a plan to make the European film industry competitive. This is also a sector in which there is money to be made, as the Americans show us. Perhaps the powers-that-be will eventually wake up and do more here.</p>
<p class="contents">The central deficits are in the distribution and marketing of our films and, of course, the industry is chronically undercapitalised. I am therefore very glad that we, Parliament, Commission and Council together, have, in the Media-Plus programme above all, got to grips with the twin areas of marketing and distribution and are endeavouring to give help.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, of course, also glad that, at the Commissioner's suggestion, the European Investment Bank is also willing to do something about this by making risk capital available for the realisation of audiovisual projects. I believe, then, that we have given a lot of things a push in this area, but can do still more. I also find it a good thing that we are achieving tax breaks at the level of the Member States, and that we can do something to enable filmmakers from one country to get resources and help from another. That, then, is possible. I think this could also be used in the framework of the i2i initiative to promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas, as we propose in this report. I believe that the extension of cinemas in economically weaker regions in the framework of the European Structural Fund can be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot more that I could say. I am not entirely in agreement with item 7, in which the call is made for television broadcasters to be obliged to reserve a certain proportion of transmission time for foreign films. That, of course, meets with great resistance from the broadcasters. We will discuss that when examining the ‘Television without Frontiers’ directive and will perhaps find a way through. Again, congratulations! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is an exemplary report in which the economy and culture are perceived in a highly coherent manner, to the benefit of both.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee naturally agreed that European films are an educational and cultural vehicle and have a huge impact on the social and aesthetic values of the European public. I see it as a noble industry which has nourished generations of cinema goers and to which we have no hesitation in entrusting our children so that they can learn about the past and acquire a penetrating and analytical perception of the society in which we live and intuition about what will happen in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We love European films; we each of us in our own countries love the national films which have marked out our lives, but we all agree that American films are stealing the show. Consequently, we need to bring about a reversal, to ensure that European films take the place they deserve, and this will only happen if we implement a series of measures, as proposed in the report, all of which, I think, are essential if we really want European films to live up to our expectations in the next decade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully subscribe to his view that it is sheer madness to think that we produce excellent films in Europe, while only 22% of those end up in cinemas, not to mention the percentage of non-national films that are being shown in the Member States, despite the fact that for people of all ages, film is the ideal medium to get to know each other’s culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that European film attracts such a small audience, while the cinema-viewing public is on the increase? It seems appropriate to me to commission the European Audiovisual Observatory to carry out an in-depth study into the motives of the film public and its film choices. Based on this, it would then be possible to use a programme such as Media Plus to support the distribution of the European film in a more focused and effective manner. In addition, the other media play an important role in the promotion of European film, of course. Radio and television may devote attention to it, but television in particular could do so in a more structured way by means of a fixed amount, or quota, in other words, of transmission time. An alternative example might be specific European channels which specialise in one particular field, for example, a pan-European children’s channel which broadcasts high-quality European children’s programmes and children’s films. Unfortunately, I am not of the same mind as Mr Vander Taelen when he states that it should be compulsory for TV channels to invest a proportion of their turnover in the film industry. As a Liberal, and also on behalf of my group, that is excessive intervention from the powers that be.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been stated before, it seems to me that the European Investment Bank has a role to play in this. One of the areas in which investments must be made is <span class="italic">e</span>-cinema. Among other things, it will enable producers to make different language versions of their films in a more straight-forward manner, which will certainly benefit children’s films, for example. After all, although we insist on a sound command of languages here in this House, the supply of adapted language versions would be another excellent way for the citizens of a Member State to get to know the culture of their European fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realised that, in the space of two and a half years, by the autumn of 2001, we have gained the commitment of the European Investment Bank, the balance proposed by the Commission for state aid, the recognition of state aid, and now the report by Mr Vander Taelen is telling us that we must circulate films. That is what I mean when I say it has come just when it is needed. It has come just at the right moment to give great support to the audiovisual industry and to the cinema tradition, which we must highlight and which I see as a new development. I would like us to get to grips with this, because we speak a great deal about cultural diversity, but tell me, please, what is cultural diversity if you do not circulate works? If cultural diversity means to strengthen each specific characteristic within another specific characteristic, we will not gain anything in terms of diversity, in the way that we want to here in Europe. It is therefore essential and necessary to circulate films. In order to illustrate how important this is, I would first of all like to thank Mr Vander Taelen, and also to express my regret that one of his amendments, and not everyone agrees on this, since it was not reviewed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, that one of his amendments, proposing that coercive measures be used to ensure the circulation of films, was not adopted. We therefore reached an agreement on undertaking a feasibility study into this circulation. That is all very well, it sounds good. I regret that we did not choose a better way. And I would like to stress two other aspects of this report. Firstly, in today’s Europe, we like to say that we have European works. That is wonderful. We have criteria to define European works, in terms of production, but we now know that it is film heritage which will also define and which defines European works. I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the issue of building up our heritage. We know that the Commission hopes to give us a European Cinematic Heritage Foundation. We also know that the Council of Europe recently stressed the importance of building up our heritage. We know very well that this cannot merely be achieved by conserving European films, but, as several of my fellow Members have already said, this comes from providing education on the diversity of European works and on what European works represent for future generations. I therefore attach great importance to the issue of heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to stress one important point, that of new technologies. New technologies are instruments for the circulation of many things, such as information, knowledge, and cinema. New technologies have their own linguistic facilities which could be of valuable help in circulating European films. I shall therefore stress the opportunities that this report could provide in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have emphasised this issue in my report on the Sixth Framework Programme that we will be voting on in a few days. However, I believe that new technologies, research into new technologies and digitalisation are all important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention. Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased. In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage – cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe – and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development. And this is precisely one of the problematic areas. Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either. Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now. That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage. We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public. There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient. They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States. Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He sums up very clearly to what an extent the success of a product, film in this instance, is dependent on the promotion of sales through marketing and advertising. When American production companies set aside 30% of their budgets for marketing, it is not to be wondered at that European products lose in direct competition for customers, when they themselves use only 3 to 6% of their budgets for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that European film producers must do more to market their products. We, as taxpayers, are also entitled to demand that they do so. One could envisage state support for follow-up projects being made dependent on the filmmakers' efforts at reaching their public. More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own. Too much money was spent in the past on films that never reached their public. Austria spends over EUR 30 million per annum on promoting films. Taking the number of cinema-goers into account, every ticket to see a film is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 000. State promotion of film cannot have this as its objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you may know, the latest Europacinema conference began here in Strasbourg last weekend, and it is continuing through today and tomorrow. The final panel discussion will be taking place in our rooms tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many discussions and many problems to resolve, such as: What is the problem, why is there no internal European market? In discussing many specific problems, whether to do with nation-states or the subsidy issue, we came up against the same point over and over again, that the distribution system does not work. We have a European internal market, but it is not accepted that this product, film, can really circulate. It is at this hurdle that we fall. Now as always, there is a national logic to film promotion, which also applies to a film's success: if it was not a box-office success at home, it will not be an international one either.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to agree with Mr Sichrovsky that an increase in subsidies would not help, but an increased subsidy from the country we both come from would help the market a bit. It would be wrong to demand that producers should take greater risks. There are no independent producers. First, we must promote this market economically, we must engage in business development, so that this market can emerge at all. Here, too, one of the demands the Culture Committee makes over and over again in many contexts would seem to be appropriate here. We must endeavour to make business development, whether it originates from large or small enterprises, tax-deductible. We will support this report not only for reasons of ideology, but also out of wholehearted conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we find ourselves faced with a terrible paradox. Europe produces more films than the United States, and these are often of a very high quality, but the market share of European films has never been this low before, it stands at 22%, whereas films from the United States take 73.7% of the European market. Furthermore, European films secure only 26% of their box office takings from sources outside the country where they were produced. These are just some observations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good report because it does not limit itself to providing an analysis of how things stand. It tackles the very reasons why the European film industry is weak, namely, its capacity for development and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to render the European film industry more competitive, the rapporteur makes very specific proposals which, in my view, are excellent. Of course, and I agree with him, we must urgently adopt an ambitious multiannual plan to improve the competitiveness of the European film industry and to strengthen the transnational distribution structures for European films. We must develop research into digital film distribution and projection techniques; we must promote the creation of a European Heritage Foundation and perform a feasibility study of ‘interconnecting’ support funds of Member States so as to increase the sources of financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, when revising the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive, we must ensure that we include a requirement for television broadcasters to invest a certain amount in the European film industry, and the obligation to promote and broadcast European films. This should also be an opportunity for Member States, which do not yet benefit from them, to consider the appropriate fiscal incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, understand the challenges we are faced with, and that they take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are debating something that is not only a major challenge in terms of the economy, but also something that is an integral part of the European Union, in other words, culture, creation and identity. That is why this is so urgent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without going back over aspects which have already been debated, I would point out here that the rapporteur has provided comprehensive proof, as I said before, that both a cultural problem and an organisational problem exist. The problems are related. I feel that the measure tabled by the committee and the decision the House makes tomorrow are so important as to warrant due reflection from the Commissioner and, indeed, a number of proposals and initiatives as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have said before and will continue to say, there needs to be a substantial cultural element in the integration of Europe, and films play a major, fundamental role in both informing people about cultural diversities and providing authenticity, allowing the message of cinema to be disseminated in all the States. There is a need for more than just organisation. That is important and, in my opinion, the report certainly raises basic issues which will lead us to greater organisation and investment than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said just now is important. If European film production increases, the number of distribution channels will have to increase too. That is why the problems are related, and it is therefore our task, our responsibility, the responsibility of Parliament, especially, and of the Commission, in particular, and the Council, to achieve this. There is nothing we can do to change the current structure of the industry. When we debate television without frontiers, then we will be able to establish rights and clear guidelines; we will be able to require television companies to distribute, promote and commission European films, but it is imperative that, in cultural terms, we realise that we must make it quite clear that<span class="bold"> </span>all the European countries must be able to benefit from films. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This initiative shows that the European Parliament is fully aware of the strategic importance, both economic and cultural, of the European film industry, but also of what hampers the circulation of films and other audiovisual works in the internal market and candidate countries, as several Members have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, which fully supports the report’s objectives, welcomes its adoption. The Commission is also pleased that our two institutions share the same viewpoint regarding the need to pursue an ambitious European policy in order to make the European audiovisual industry more competitive. Several recent initiatives by the Commission in this area are proof of this common approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are more than aware, the recent Commission communication on certain legal aspects related to cinematographic and other audiovisual works that my colleague, Viviane Reding, presented to the Council on 5 November, tackles the issues of the circulation of E-cinema, the tax regime applied to the industry, the protection of European audiovisual heritage, the classification of works and other problems affecting the circulation of films and other audiovisual works. The implementation of the measures set out in this communication, combined with the application of the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2005) and the joint initiative undertaken by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, i2i Audiovisual, should help to significantly improve the situation of European films.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, Mr President, I would like to come back to some points of the motion for a resolution which has been submitted to you. With regard to the measures that are currently being undertaken, the second point of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to pursue a consistent Community policy on the film industry, particularly as regards the application of its competition policy. The above-mentioned communication provides the film industry with increased legal certainty by specifying, as part of a constructive and positive approach, the criteria used by the Commission when assessing national support schemes for the film sector under the Treaty’s rules on State funding. To date, all the national schemes reviewed on this basis have been accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 5 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, in implementing MEDIA Plus, to draw attention to the Europa Cinemas network of cinemas, and item 6 calls on the Commission to support the ‘Shooting Stars’ initiative of the organisation European Film Promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">These projects are undeniably of value and have received Community support for several years as part of the MEDIA programme. However, it is important to point out that the actions under the MEDIA programme are subject to calls for proposals and to the principle of fair competition and project selection according to a transparent procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 7 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, when revising the directive, to investigate the desirability and feasibility of imposing new quotas on broadcasters. The Commission has already launched, pursuant to Article 25(a) of the directive, an independent study to assess the impact of measures for promoting the production and distribution of European television programmes. This study will also assess, more specifically, the effectiveness of quotas laid down under the directive, compared to other support measures. Furthermore, at the beginning of 2002, the Commission will undertake a public consultation on this subject. It will urge all the parties concerned to submit written comments. The results of the various studies and of the public consultation will provide a significant contribution to the communication on the review of the directive and any proposals for amendments, which the Commission plans to submit to the Council and to the European Parliament towards the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 33 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to consider introducing specific European regulations in order to stimulate the development of the film industry in the candidate countries. This central concern is taken into account as part of the external action of the European audiovisual policy under the heading of enlargement. Candidate countries are therefore obliged to respect the ‘acquis communautaire’ where the audiovisual sector is concerned. As you know, this mainly concerns the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive. In addition, they will be able to take part in the MEDIA programme as soon as they have reached a high degree of compatibility with the ‘acquis communautaire’. Furthermore, nine candidate countries were asked to take part in the MEDIA Plus programme. The aim is for these countries to participate from the beginning of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 26 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of ‘interconnecting’ the existing automatic support funds of the Member States and regions. It must be reiterated that an assessment was already carried out in 1998 in Birmingham, by the ‘Club des Producteurs Européens’. The working group associated with the Commission came to the following conclusion: the proposed mechanism would, in practice, exclude many Member States who have no automatic support system for production. As a result, the automatic support funds of the smaller countries would be drained by the more commercially successful countries, in other words, the main producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 27 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Committee to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of setting up a European Promotion Fund. Council Decision No 2000/821/EC establishing the MEDIA Plus programme already, in its ‘Promotion’ section, lays down support for promotional activities in favour of European creation, in other words, approximately 8% of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission welcomes the amendment, which was tabled in plenary by the rapporteur, to set up an implementing agency. The Commission will inform the rapporteur and Parliament about its proposal on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the Commission’s comments on the report by Mr Vander Taelen, who I would again like to thank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
