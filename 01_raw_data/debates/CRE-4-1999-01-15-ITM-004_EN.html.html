<p class="contents">One month ago we were wondering what impact the economic instability resulting from the crises in the Asian and Latin American markets would have. And now this week, still without having had an approximate assessment of the impact of the crisis that flared up in August, a new episode in the saga has developed with the devaluation of the Brazilian currency. This may drag down other Mercosur currencies or force them to make adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this situation could temporarily benefit the Brazilian economy, it has already caused a truly spectacular stampede of capital. And we are facing this fresh crisis with our new currency, the euro, which was indeed greeted with loud applause from the Japanese market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not know how the economy will behave. Nor do we know how, in the medium term, it will withstand the consequences of a possible deterioration of the crisis, an increase in imports or unfair practices against our industry and exports. As we all know, unfair practices and increased imports are already damaging two industrial sectors that are particularly sensitive: iron and steel, and shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past 20 years, these two sectors have suffered losses and staffing levels have been drastically reduced. If such reductions continue, these sectors will disappear. We will have gone from considering strategic aspects to industrial ruin in a period of 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We wonder what will happen to employment and that is the million dollar question. Japanese and Korean practices aimed at cornering markets, their State aid and, in short, their unfair practices and disregard for standards that attempt to regulate the sector at a global level should all make us think carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">If these attitudes persist, the OECD or even the World Trade Organisation will find their regulatory role and their prestige severely affected. The shipbuilding sector, for example, cannot make any more sacrifices. If State aid disappears before the year 2000 and current practices continue – namely Asian dumping – the majority of shipyards will be forced to close and all the work on modernising and adapting them, financed with European citizens" money, will have been in vain. If steel imports continue to be subsidised in the country of origin, I do not know how our businesses will be able to survive when left at such an unacceptable disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I should like to remind the Commission that the proposal for a resolution on shipbuilding included an amendment that called for a study on how to address the problems described. Could the Commission inform us of the results of this study and the corresponding proposals, as well as giving us its opinion on the extension of State aid until the year 2000?</p>
<p class="contents">And as regards steel and industry, what proposals could the Commission put forward to support the affected sectors and when could it present them? What trade policy measures could it muster up to combat the growing number of cases of unfair practice?</p>

As we predicted, the crisis in South‐East Asia has had global repercussions. The collapse of the financial system in the Far East has led to weaker market demand there. The question that has been raised today in the House can only be the beginning of a very fundamental debate on this problem. The European economy, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the crisis, is legitimately entitled to financial support in the sectors affected. This is the background to our question.</p>
<p class="contents">So far the EU has in large part been able to cushion the changing trade conditions which have arisen as a result of the crisis and has also borne the corresponding financial burdens. No other market, not even the American market, has had to cope with such a substantial rise in imports both in terms of absolute figures and percentages. The European market is now being swamped with goods which would normally be exported to markets in the Far East. Not only does this development look set to continue, but it will accelerate. The damage inflicted on the European steel market, for example, will be further exacerbated by the dishonest trade practices implemented in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the intention of the American steel industry to solve the problem through draconian trade‐policy measures, or protectionist measures, constitutes a serious threat to the EU market. I call upon the Commission to see to it that the United States Administration is left in no doubt that, if it does not demonstrate solidarity in such matters but, on the contrary, resorts to dishonest measures, it will have to reckon with severe countermeasures on the part of the European Union. If the EU does not adopt a clear and unambiguous position, the USA will make further attempts to push forward its own world trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that European industry is clearly in no way to blame for the present critical situation in the US market, in which it has operated extremely well over a long period of time, the United States must be called upon, at the highest political level, to ensure that there is a fairer trade policy. The USA and Europe play a leading role in the WTO. Conduct that is less than exemplary would be disadvantageous for both sides.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the previous resolutions of 17 September and 3 December 1998 on the global financial crisis do not make today"s oral questions and motions for resolutions redundant or merely repetitive. That is because, in this first part‐session of 1999, this subject is still current, and because the economic situation is unlikely to stabilise.</p>
<p class="contents">Another recent resolution, this time on asymmetric shocks, which was also adopted in December, was particularly relevant in the context of the financial crisis and its consequences on the national economies. It further strengthens the belief that this is the right time to discuss and determine solutions to prevent this situation from having economic and social effects on European industry and international financial development. The situation is changing and developing, at times at a dizzying speed, and the signs are not reassuring. If it was considered that the events in Brazil in October were the worst point of the crisis and that efforts had been made and financial resources mobilised to prevent this turning into a disaster, then the news of the last few days must be worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are supporting the joint motion for a resolution, although we believe that it fails to attribute the basic responsibility for the crisis, which lies with the priority given to the financial and nominal situation over the real economy. We also feel it is right that concern is growing and that the requests are becoming urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of references to shipbuilding and iron and steel, which is the aim of Amendment No 2, is very relevant. However, it justifies an extension to other sectors, particularly the textile sector, which was included with these other sectors in a recital of our motion for a resolution and which was sacrificed to the benefit of the joint motion. We therefore believe that, in order for the amendment to be approved, it should include the textile sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here about currency problems, stock market collapses and financial crises. Those are the subjects of these oral questions and motions for resolutions. However, the crux of the matter is that it is becoming clear that this is increasingly a question of the currency, stock market and financial aspects of a latent economic crisis that is about to explode. Brazil had better watch out. Indeed, this crisis is due to the fact that the financial and speculative instruments and mechanisms are out of synch with the structure and operation of the real economy.</p>

<p class="contents">There seems to be a remarkable similarity between the build‐up to the Asia crisis and that more recently in Brazil with, in both cases, massive lending power being given on the basis of over‐optimistic projections of growth and industrialisation. Investors, of course, can leave as quickly as they arrive, taking their money with them. And when the bottom falls out of an economy there can be enormous knock‐on effects.</p>
<p class="contents">In Scotland, as elsewhere, we are still suffering from the effects of the Asia crisis, with promised investments failing to materialise and with delays in lowering interest rates and the strong exchange rate of sterling continuing to hit our industries and our exports hard. While the crisis in Brazil may not be quite so serious it can still have repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater economic stability in Europe should increase our ability to safeguard the well‐being of those of our citizens most directly affected.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, given that there are a number of questions on the impact of the financial crisis on European industry, I will, if there are no objections, answer them in one fell swoop. I will begin with the questions on the general impact of the crisis and then move on to answer those that refer specifically to the steel sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year"s downturn in the world economic climate undoubtedly had a negative impact on the European Union. However, in 1998, good internal conditions more than compensated for negative external effects. The growth of the 15 Member States in 1998 was 0.1 % higher than predicted in March 1998. The economic crisis will mean losses for the European Union"s economy in 1999. However, its effects should, in principle, be limited thanks to the introduction of the euro, as Mrs Miranda just mentioned, and by maintaining healthy economic conditions. The Commission trusts that Europe"s economy will recover in the year 2000, a year in which it is hoped growth will reach 2.8 %.</p>
<p class="contents">In that general context, some sectors of European industry are faced with fierce competition from imports. There has been an increase in imports from South‐East Asia and other regions. But exports have also increased in all sectors, despite the drop in exports to South‐East Asia. In the year leading up to September 1998, the European Union registered a trade surplus of ECU 22 billion for industrial products, that is, ECU 16 billion less than the surplus for the same period in 1997. The significant devaluations of South‐East Asian currencies have damaged the competitiveness of short‐term European prices. However, this has been partially compensated for by the high national inflation rates in those countries. It is difficult to predict what the final impact of the crisis in South‐East Asia will be in terms of the EU"s relative competitive position. It is particularly difficult due to the fact that the fluctuations in South‐East Asian exchange rates can have repercussions on the countries" commercial output and competitiveness. As a result, it is difficult to give a prognosis at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Commission is concerned about the implications of an increase in competitive pressure on European industry. This heavy pressure will probably continue in 1999, although perhaps not at such high levels as in 1998. The European Union"s trade balance for industrial products should improve in relation to 1998. Although we do not yet have data for the 1998 period, the Commission calculates that the direct repercussions are marginal in terms of total industrial output for that year, but that they could be more significant in 1999. When the Commission made its autumn forecast, it pointed out that it expected growth in employment to reach 1.2 % in 1998, a more rapid rate of growth than the 0.8 % rate recorded in spring. However, the slower growth of gross domestic product in 1999 will also be accompanied by a drop in the employment growth rate to 0.9 %. Nonetheless, it is hoped that unemployment will continue to decrease. It should have dropped to 10 % in 1998 and should then drop to 9.5 % in 1999, from a maximum of 11.2 % recorded in 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the increase in competitive pressure on European industry, this does not necessarily mean that the Union"s trading partners are using unfair trade practices. The Commission is prepared to apply the instruments of the Union"s commercial policy where conditions dictate and in accordance with the relevant WTO agreements. To illustrate this point, only last week the Commission initiated two proceedings, based on two complaints submitted by the European Union"s steel industry. The first relates to dumping concerning hot‐rolled strips from Bulgaria, Iran, Yugoslavia, India, Taiwan and South Africa. The second is a complaint against subsidies for the same products from India, Taiwan and South Africa. None of the countries mentioned in the anti‐dumping or anti‐subsidy cases are South‐East Asian countries implementing IMF stabilisation programmes. The Commission is not aware of unfair trade practices relating to imports of steel products into the Community, except for the cases it is already dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">During 1998, until the month of September, imports of finished or semi‐finished steel products rose to 18.5 million tonnes, 6.6 million tonnes more than for the corresponding period in 1997. At the same time, exports dropped by 2.7 million tonnes to 18.3 million tonnes. As a result, the European Union showed a trade deficit of 0.2 million tonnes compared with a surplus of 9.2 million tonnes for the previous year. The unexpected increase in imports of steel products into the European Union caused prices to collapse in the second half of 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Demand for steel from the manufacturing industry is expected to fall in the first half of 1999, but is later expected to improve, leading to total annual results similar to those of previous years. In 1999, the level of imports is expected to remain high.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult for the Commission to estimate to what extent the South‐East Asian steel industry will contribute to economic recovery in the region, given that it varies from country to country. Nonetheless, it is clear that several countries in the region significantly increased their revenue from steel products in 1998. This was the case for South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, China and Indonesia, amongst other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">During the United States‐European Union Summit, held in Washington on 18 December 1998, debates were held on a wide variety of issues and one of these related to imports of steel products. The Commission highlighted the need to keep markets open and to avoid delaying the recovery of those countries hit by the crisis that were carrying out IMF stabilisation programmes. It is essential that all parties involved act in a responsible manner and in accordance with international standards in order to safeguard the advantages of trade liberalisation and avoid further trade disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States administration, for its part, is aware that imposing trade barriers would harm countries that have been seriously affected by economic problems. But it is also facing strong internal pressure to react to the recent fluctuations in steel imports. There is a possibility that the United States may adopt commercial measures on steel imports in the coming months. The Commission will follow any developments closely to ensure that the United States acts in accordance with international trade standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now briefly like to refer to two questions that have been raised. The first is from Mrs Miranda de Lage on the impact of the Asian crisis on the shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the devaluation of various currencies in South‐East Asia, the Koreans, in particular, have enjoyed higher sales in this sector. However, the Community industry managed to maintain a strong position in the world market in 1998: it obtained 29 % of new orders between January and September 1998, as opposed to 22 % for Korea. As I said earlier, the Commission is watching closely to ensure that the countries involved in the crisis respect the conditions laid down by the International Monetary Fund and, more specifically, the conditions relating to structural reforms and the relations between industry and the Korean Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say a few words on the impact of recent events in Brazil on European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, at this stage, it is still difficult to give a correct diagnosis, and would, in fact, be rather hasty. A great deal will depend on how the financial markets react to the events in Brazil. Here we have – as you will also have – the latest news to reach us on how the markets reacted and on the packet of urgent measures put forward by the Brazilian Congress. These were part of the fiscal reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund, in exchange for aid amounting to USD 42 billion. These measures form part of the restructuring plan being pursued by President Fernando Cardoso. The Managing Director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, yesterday stated that he was satisfied with Brazil"s commitment to apply the budgetary consolidation programme agreed with the IMF. At the same time, the Brazilian President has continued to send out messages of confidence to investors.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the European Union and Brazil have important trade links and European businesses have invested quite substantially in industrial development in Brazil, in the automobile sector for example. The European Union imports a large quantity of raw materials from Brazil and the devaluation of the real could obviously force down the prices of these products, with some positive implications for European industry. However, the devaluation might increase the competitiveness of Brazilian exports to the European Union and reduce the competitiveness of the European industry"s exports to Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few comments I wanted to make on the situation currently unfolding. There is still a need for caution in a situation such as this as we do not know how the financial markets will behave over the days and weeks to come.</p>

<p class="contents">I also believe, however, that we all know the success of Europe's economy will be judged not so much in monetary terms but in relation to the real economy, and there the situation is not at all encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment, the supposedly number one economic problem, which I fear we are making zero effort to address, has stabilised despite all your forecasts – for what you told us, Commissioner, amounts to no more than forecasts – at around 10.5 %, and even if it falls by 0.5 % that is not very much.</p>
<p class="contents">We have long forgotten the optimistic words spoken by Mr Delors in this Chamber at the beginning of our parliamentary term, about the creation of 15 million new jobs which would reduce unemployment to 6 or 7 %. The prospective growth rate of Europe's economy in 1999 has fallen to just 1.4 %. The money market crisis in the third world, which has of course become a crisis of the real economy there, has brought about huge job losses, reductions in real incomes and a fall of our own exports. It is a fact that any development comes from the services sector in our own area and in the United States, while in contrast, in the manufacturing industry, there are already clear signs of surplus production capacity. In the face of such a situation, it is not surprising that voices have been raised in favour of protectionism. And what you told us about the steel industry verges on a brief protectionist declaration, not by yourself, but one that is increasingly to be heard in major parliaments, in Congress and in other decision‐making centres in the world. This is a very dangerous development, because there is nothing more dangerous than a return to the restrictions on world trade, which would of course affect the weakest economies worst.</p>
<p class="contents">Without oversimplifying matters, common sense shows that we must not make such a difficult situation even more difficult by suppressing demand in our own economy by the restrictions we have imposed on financial policy, in other words the celebrated 3 % deficit limit of the Stability Pact. Besides, it is forecast that in 1999, in the present economic situation, the 3 % limit will not easily be held to by Germany, Italy and France, in other words the big European countries. Will unemployment have to increase to 25 % before we begin reviewing a restrictive policy which, though it may have reduced inflation to zero, is now moving towards the achievement of zero employment as well?</p>

<p class="contents">I would first of all point out how unwise we were to condemn the instruments that gave us the ECSC Treaty. At that time, I asked for more care to be taken. We knew that the crises in the iron and steel industry would reoccur fairly frequently and we now find ourselves very poorly equipped.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a little too late for you to tell us that the Commission is going to determine whether or not the United States contravenes the international conventions or international WTO commitments. As Mr Katiforis has just pointed out, measures have already been taken by the United States, which do not seem, at least at first sight, to comply to any great extent with WTO commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission seems to be equally at a loss when it tells us that caution is necessary and that the situation is difficult: that is just about all it can tell us. We should be able to say to the WTO that changes in the exchange rate are in some respects similar to duties or customs duties. What difference is there between imposing a customs duty on imports and devaluing the currency in a competitive manner? There is something amiss there. Rather, the emphasis should be placed more on the stabilisation of exchange rates and we should positively adopt the approaches that Japan and some of our countries have already taken. In my opinion, we should either improve the stability of exchange rates or at least ensure that we still have the resources to protect ourselves like other countries.</p>

The next volcano is already showing signs of erupting. That is China.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that capitalism, with its capital markets, creates instability and imbalance in the world. Today"s capital markets are hyperinflated. Any concept of inflation worth its salt must take account of the fact that capital markets mean the unrestricted rise in value of capital goods. International institutions issue erroneous advice when this situation occurs. They give the same kind of advice to all countries, which are all different, and generally that advice is deflation, or, in the case of industrialised countries, cuts in social welfare. These institutions, under the leadership of the IMF, do not prevent the forest fires from starting: they only light other fires to counter the problem, but that is not enough. We should be preventing the fire, or, in this case, the volcanic eruptions, from starting at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation the left has a real opportunity. Real capitalism causes problems, so let us make a joint assessment of the situation and work according to that. The third way is the outside lane. We must now together find the second way for the left and the Greens.</p>

Instead, we need to develop strategies, at the core of which must be, not moralistic advice, but well‐understood self‐interest. The very real danger of a deflationary process which can no longer be controlled is moving ever closer. Assurances that there is really no problem ring ever more hollow. We must realise that long‐term stabilisation of the global financial architecture is impossible without the stabilisation of the economy in global terms, and that this will not come about without the stabilisation of the global social order. In other words, the question is not: how do we arrive at an alternative global economic and social order? This would be illusory. Instead, the old Keynesian questions – not his answers – are becoming once again very pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we achieve a global payment system that functions well and remains stable in the face of short‐term irritations and volatility? How do we achieve a global monetary policy? How do we construct an international trade organisation that is in a position to stabilise commodity prices? How do we achieve aid programmes with low‐cost loans and subsidies to assist developing countries? And now that we are faced with globalisation it is no longer just a question of developing countries but also sectors, projects and industries.</p>
<p class="contents">The present discussion is too narrowly focused on the imposition of antidumping and antisubsidising measures, which in effect means denying certain countries the opportunity to develop. The question must be posed differently: how is it in fact possible to solve the problem of actual demand, which is currently not being met, in terms of the value of money? As an example, let us take global shipping. We have a shipping fleet which is completely outdated, environmentally unsound and unsafe, the renovation of which would bring lasting employment and progress in resource efficiency. So, instead of continually asking the wrong question about the world economy locomotive, we should be asking ourselves about a joint global investment train; as Europeans, we can make a contribution here and we have a responsibility to do so, a responsibility which we are currently not fulfilling.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have a delegation from the US Congress here in the House. It is apparent to all that our debate is highly topical and that global problems need to be tackled at a global level. Although the European Parliament can be criticised for perhaps proceeding with considerable caution and deliberation in certain matters, I nevertheless believe that the fundamental criterion for the European Parliament is to produce results and to benefit those who need it.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House we have already dealt on a number of occasions with turbulences in the world of international finance. In Europe we now have the euro, which has brought with it a new stability, at least in the euro zone of the eleven and thus in the European Union as a whole. Through the single market we have made progress in respect of border tariff problems, and we are also moving in the right direction in the area of subsidies. That is why I am very grateful to my colleagues in the House for providing the opportunity for us to devote our attention once again to this issue, in particular to the repercussions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Entire sectors of industry, such as the pharmaceutical industry, ship building and, above all, the steel industry, are facing new challenges. Our opportunities for export in these areas have shrunk dramatically. Exports to Asia, for example, have fallen by 56 %. By contrast, imports into the single market from this region have risen sharply. Import escalation rates of up to 700 % are currently being quoted. For the first time the European Union has become a net importer of steel. We must work together to reverse this trend, in the interests of those industries affected and of their employees.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these developments, I am delighted that we can today welcome to Strasbourg a delegation from the United States Congress. The USA is facing similar, if not quite so far‐reaching, challenges. We can only get to grips with these developments through cooperation, joint strategies and a joint problem‐solving approach. In this way each country will take on its share of the responsibility, but always in relation to the actual burdens and opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, free access to markets has a crucial role to play. Trade‐policy instruments naturally include antidumping measures and WTO procedures in places where state interference is pushing down the price of exports. But such measures can only be regarded as a last resort. In the long term we need constructive transatlantic dialogue because only if we preserve free trade in goods and observe the rules of fair competition on both sides of the Atlantic, will we be able to guarantee a stable global environment.</p>

However, it also demonstrates the same concern we have when asking questions. And those of us who live in regions such as Asturias are concerned. Asturias has already lost more than 6 000 direct jobs in the steel industry, not to mention the indirect job losses that can also be added to this figure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to us to prevent further job losses. This is the Union"s main concern at the moment. Not only must we create employment, but we must also ensure that existing jobs are not lost. If we do not do so, the employment plans drawn up in all the Member States will be of little use.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution we have signed there is the suggestion – and I know it is not a very popular one – that we should once again discuss a tax on financial capital transfers in the economies of such countries. We do not know what might happen in Brazil. You said so yourself. We have received this news but we do not know what impact it will have on the European Union"s economy. Nor do we know whether the European Union, in spite of the euro umbrella sheltering us, will be able to weather the storm of serious problems that will affect such extremely important sectors in the future, that is, the steel, shipbuilding and textiles sectors. This last sector is not included in an amendment by Mr Kittelmann, but we suggest that it be included because it is also extremely important.</p>

I will very briefly say to Mr Katiforis – whom I cannot see here at the moment – that I in fact believe that it would be a serious mistake at this time of international economic fragility for the European Union to lift protectionist barriers. This could provoke similar responses all over the world and lead us into a global recession that could last for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Herman – whom I cannot see here either – that the Commission does not believe that the American plan for the steel industry is its last word on the policy it is going to adopt in order to address pressures facing the steel trade. Instead, we believe it is the beginning of a negotiating process with Congress and the steel industry that could lead to specific measures within a few months.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say to Mr Herman that the ECSC Treaty still applies. Our steel industry is bearing up well. The measures that the United States is currently adopting are the same as those being adopted by the European Community, in other words, provisions for applying the instruments of the commercial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some speeches, specifically that by Mr Wolf, I should also like to say that our concern at the current moment is that the countries in crisis come out of it as quickly as possible. This would not only benefit them but would also put them in a position to import European products. Consequently, I believe that, on the one hand, we must see how well we can survive this situation, and on the other hand, we must help these countries to recover as we will then be able to export to them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that the World Trade Organisation does not accept measures against currency devaluations and, until now, the United States and the European Union have not applied any measures in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to Mr Rübig that we must use the instruments of our commercial policy against unfair practices in imports, that is, the instruments I referred to earlier: the anti‐dumping and anti‐subsidy instruments. In any event, I should like to say that I have fully noted all this morning"s speeches and I will pass them on to my colleagues in the Commission.</p>

Leaving aside Europe as a whole, and concentrating instead on France, I would actually be even more cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">Even a moderate slowing down in growth can have very negative consequences if it occurs in a country that has no room for manoeuvre. This is the case with France. It already has record compulsory levies, it no longer has any monetary autonomy following the introduction of the euro, and it cannot, in any case, allow itself the luxury of increasing its budget deficit, which is already the highest in the European Union in terms of percentage of GDP. These constraints will be added to further by a series of additional costs caused by socialist policies, from the cost of the 35‐hour week to that of the massive programme to regulate the situation of illegal immigrants. This does not even include the costs of the euro resulting from the establishment of the European public authority needed for its operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Without returning to the issue of the single currency, on which my feelings are well known, I must stress that the European Union can be useful to us in a crisis if it conducts a vigorous common trade policy to combat dumping, for example in the iron and steel industry or shipbuilding, and to ensure compliance with the Community preference, for example in agriculture. The EU must also help us to conduct international negotiations aimed at a relative stabilisation of exchange rates, an action that goes hand in hand with a common trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not delude ourselves: Europe can only provide us with supplementary aid. The essence of the solution is in the hands of the French themselves. They must choose between the current negligence which, if it continues, will one day mean that we are controlled by Europe, or an effort of self‐discipline which alone will be able to preserve our sovereignty.</p>
