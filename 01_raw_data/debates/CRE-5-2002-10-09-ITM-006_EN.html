<p class="contents">It is a great honour for me to be given this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament on where matters stand with the revision of the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment policy affects something of fundamental importance to human beings, namely the work we do. The Bible says that we must earn our bread by the sweat of our brow. Work has many other functions in addition to this, however. It is in the workplace that we spend most of our waking lives. It is here that we forge a large number of connections with other people, and it is often these people we miss most if we lose our jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The new areas that are to help make Europe into a leading power include an extensive labour market and social responsibility on the part of enterprises. All too often, the labour market is comparable to a centrifuge, in which far too many people end up on the periphery. We must therefore develop ideas about how this situation can be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we also face a series of common challenges which we must solve if we are to retain the European social model, combining economic effectiveness with good social security arrangements and a market economy with the welfare society.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement of the European Union to include a number of Eastern and Central European countries – with or without transitional arrangements – means the free movement of labour in the new and larger EU. A number of countries, including Denmark, chose to embrace the free movement of labour from the first day of their membership. We in Denmark see no problem with the free movement of labour. On the contrary, we view the new Member States as a resource.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary task towards the end of the year consists in reaching agreement on the framework for revising the Employment Strategy. In 2003, we shall then get to grips with the discussions concerning the actual strategy and the individual guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">As its point of departure, the Presidency has attached great importance to our obtaining a thorough debate before a new and revised Employment Strategy is devised. In that connection, it is important for all the central actors to have their say.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure there is enough time for the debate, we thought it important to give the subject a central place in the Danish Presidency’s programme in the employment and socio-political area and to begin revising the strategy no later than at the first formal Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">That provides the best opportunity to send a clear signal to the Commission as early as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in the individual countries naturally have a central role in connection with the evaluation. It is they who have been responsible for implementing and monitoring the strategy since it was introduced in 1997. They therefore have a great deal of valuable first-hand experience of the present strategy's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, of course, another important source of experience and results from the first five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, other actors too have, however, obtained relevant experience to which consideration should be given in connection with the current evaluation. That applies especially, of course, to the European Parliament. In this connection, I took note of the points of view published by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the middle of September. I am able to go a long way towards endorsing the views that have been presented of what should be the core features of a revised strategy and the desires that have been expressed to consider how cooperation between the various actors can be further developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to mention the national and European parties in the labour market who, actively involved as they are, also have important observations to contribute. Revision of the European Employment Strategy was on the Council’s agenda in Luxembourg yesterday. It is therefore an extremely topical subject to be included on the agenda for the plenary debate here today.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the Commission’s communication takes stock of experiences from the first five years of the Employment Strategy. It contains a general evaluation of the results achieved on the European labour markets, and it outlines the most important issues in connection with a revision of the strategy. The communication is a crucial point of departure for the debate now taking place in various forums.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this communication, a common statement from, respectively, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Economic-Political Committee was presented to the Council meeting, providing their assessment of the most important principles for a revised strategy. The Presidency has always wanted them to be able to present a common statement.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that a common statement, capable of being endorsed by the relevant Councils, was synonymous with the strongest possible political signal of what is wanted in political terms from the future strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">A common statement is, moreover, in accordance with the current desire for better coordination between, and streamlining of, the various European processes such as the employment guidelines and the guidelines governing general economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be no secret about there being many different points of view on how far the revision of the Employment Strategy should go.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency’s ambition has, however, been firstly to work for a compromise capable of uniting those Member States that want to see the Employment Strategy considerably revised with those that want to see far fewer changes. For us, the task has therefore been to secure a common platform for further work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased to be able now to report that the Council offered its unanimous endorsement of the common statement by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Economic-Political Committee. A strong political signal was thus also conveyed concerning the framework and principles that the governments of the Member States believe should form the basis for preparing for the revision of the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like here to state some of the most important principles.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, it must be emphasised that the overall perspective of the Employment Strategy must be retained, with special focus upon the priorities for employment policy. This means that special attention must be given to the results that, based on the Lisbon objectives of more and better jobs, are to be achieved through the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers also approved the need to simplify the employment guidelines and, as far as possible, reduce their scope by having them focus upon common strategic priorities including national strategies for lifelong learning, supported by suitable objectives relating, for example, to the number of people who might be engaged in one form of education or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Importance is also attached to the future strategy’s helping meet the challenges faced by the countries concerned in the form of different demographic features, increased globalisation, the knowledge society and EU enlargement. There is agreement that the strategy should concentrate more specifically on the following broad objectives: job creation and increasing labour force participation, improved quality of work, improvement and modernisation of the functioning of the labour market and the ensuring of both flexibility and job security.</p>
<p class="contents">To enlarge upon this, I would especially emphasise the need to increase the labour force supply via policies that promote jobs for women, older people and vulnerable groups; by encouraging active and preventive labour market policies that are effective and efficient; by reforming tax and benefit systems and so creating clear incentives for taking up, and remaining in, employment; by improving lifelong learning, skills and mobility; by increasing equality between men and women and by combating discrimination; and by promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council, in expressing its support yesterday, expressed a wish for the strategy further to reflect the fact that the focus is on the medium-term challenges set out by the Lisbon strategy where, for example, the participation rates for women and older people are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Implicit in this is the wish for greater stability in the guidelines over time. In other words, they must not necessarily be changed each year. The wish for stability also conceals the fact that work is under way to ensure a greater degree of coordination and less overlap between the various European cooperation processes.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Presidency view these general principles, endorsed by the Council, as a contribution and pointer to the Commission in connection with its ongoing work as the end of the year approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s agreement yesterday means that there are a number of factors that will have to be debated further over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">That is especially true when it comes to the more active involvement of the two sides of industry and of the European Parliament. There is therefore a clear desire to enter into more practical deliberations as to how the European Parliament can play a larger role in the preparation and development of the Employment Strategy. The role of the national parliaments is also to be recognised in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">One important matter still to be dealt with is the whole discussion of the scope and of the type of indicators. These are crucial to monitoring the strategy and to ensuring that countries move in the desired direction and at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore also crucial that, as soon as a clear picture of the new strategy emerges, there be a thorough examination of the existing indicators. The purpose of such an examination must be to ensure that the indicators reflect the core objectives of the revised guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective must be a more efficient set of indicators, which are robust, comparable, more focused on the individual guidelines and based upon up-to-date data. We should like to achieve a situation in which we have fewer, but better, indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise in conclusion that the Danish Presidency wishes to make the Employment Strategy easier to operate and more serviceable as a starting point for employment-promoting strategies in the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get away from the tendency to focus increasingly upon details and instruments and instead concentrate on the results to which the European Council has attached importance since the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with revising the Employment Strategy, we must never lose sight of the big picture. Over the next few years, the idea of a revised European Employment Strategy is that it should help make Europe more coherent as a continent and as a society.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is that the Employment Strategy should be targeted and that the decision-making process in connection with the adoption and implementation of the strategy’s individual features should become more transparent. In endeavouring to create ever more employment, the European Union should attach key importance to targeting and transparency, to involving a larger number of actors and to rooting employment policy more firmly in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never forget that it is the practical results that, in the last analysis, are the test of whether the European Union’s Employment Strategy is effective. The methods must be put to the test in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, firstly I congratulate the European Parliament for its stimulating and constructive resolution which was adopted on 25 September 2002. It provides a useful assessment of successes and achievements as well as some of the weaknesses of the European Employment Strategy. It is, of course, important that it identifies concrete priorities for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution was most valuable to the Council. The discussions we had yesterday in Luxembourg concerned both the evaluation of the European Employment Strategy and the streamlining of processes in the context of the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Minister said, there was a consensus between the Member States on the content and the procedures for the future. I am pleased to say that there is now a large common platform of shared views between the three institutions upon which we can base the further development of the strategy and, in particular, define the next generation of employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on three main areas: policy messages, the process and governance of the process. First, as far as the policy messages are concerned, we all agree that the integrated coverage of broad areas is one of the positive achievements of this strategy. There is an agreement that there is a need to keep this wide range of issues within the strategy and not to narrow its scope. Some progress has also been made on the identification of key priorities. There is a long list of these, including job creation and increasing labour force participation; improving quality in work; modernising and improving the functioning of the labour market; ensuring flexibility and security; increasing labour force supply via policies promoting an inclusive labour market; promoting active and preventive labour market policies; reforming tax and benefit systems; improving lifelong learning skills and mobility and promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the next step will consist of transforming this long list into a structured proposal for Employment Guidelines. It remains to be seen whether or not the current four-pillar structure, on which we have articulated the development strategy, is still needed in order to reflect these priorities, or if other groupings could improve their visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">If possible, the guidelines should be reduced in number. This brings me to the second issue which is the process. Within the framework provided by the Treaty, the Employment Strategy should focus on the medium and long-term challenges to be met by the Lisbon 2010 deadlines. With a view to ensuring a clearer focus on outcomes and on the medium and long-term goals of the strategy, there is a need for greater stability in the Employment Guidelines which should not be changed every year. Member States' National Action Plans must focus more on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Overlaps and duplications with other processes should be more limited, in particular, through coordination between the employment strategy and the broad economic policy guidelines. It is crucial that the respective roles and contributions be better defined.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the governance of the process. This is an issue on which the European Parliament expressed great interest in its resolution of 25 September 2002. The ideas for future orientations which I have just outlined should provide a better framework for more openness and participation. Less and clearer objectives should make the strategy more visible. A stronger focus on implementation and results should provide a better knowledge-base and more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, within this new framework, and with a stronger, more concrete focus, social partners would play a more effective role, and regional and local authorities would understand their role more easily and could participate more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Further consideration should be given as to how the European Parliament could be actively involved in the design and development of the employment strategy and on how national parliaments can be better integrated into this process. There are major problems in some Member States, where the national parliaments have not participated in, nor have, in some cases, any idea about the employment strategy, the monetary procedures or the common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">This is quite a long list of shared convictions and perspectives but the new process for the strategy has only just begun. As you know, the formal proposal for the employment guidelines 2003 will be presented in April 2003 together with the proposal for the broad economic policy guidelines. In the meantime, there is room and time for everybody to become part of the process and to make their voices heard. The Commission will continue to develop the idea of open participation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to further stimulate and facilitate the involvement of potential stakeholders, the Commission intends to adopt another communication. This will be presented in January and will give an outline of the revised strategy with concrete objectives and targets. There is enough time for a rich exchange of views with the Parliament over the next few months in order to define and to agree on procedures for the new European Employment Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bastos (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in closing the skills gap in the European labour market. A gap clearly exists, however, in occupational and geographical mobility in the Union. With regard to the first of these, European citizens do not change jobs very frequently, although most Member States have experienced an upward trend since 1995. With regard to the movement of workers between Member States and nationally, the picture is no more encouraging: our rate of mobility is almost half of that of US citizens, with only a small elite of 225 000 European citizens moving to another Union country; in other words, 0.1% of the population of the Fifteen.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in February 2002, the Commission produced an action plan for skills and mobility that identifies 25 measures intended to respond to the shortcomings and needs indicated by the high-level task force. I feel bound to criticise the Commission for having presented its proposals directly to the Barcelona European Council before giving Parliament the opportunity to comment on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the coherence of the action plan’s recommendations should be highlighted, European citizens still face many obstacles. In this report, which I had the honour of drafting, in accordance with the Hughes procedure, in cooperation with the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and incorporating the opinions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee of the Regions, which proved to be important and valuable contributions – I would highlight various measures intended to promote occupational and geographical mobility and the elimination of obstacles to their full realisation, some of which I shall now discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">- Firstly, local authorities should be involved in setting up a network of industry-based and educational advisory bodies to bring the world of work and education systems closer together; other, more effective actions need to be taken in order to reduce regional imbalances given that the basic reason for regional inequalities in terms of employment growth is the differences in the skill and educational levels and the mobility and adaptability of the labour force;</p>
<p class="contents">- Secondly, Member States should provide support for one of the pillars of the European Employment Strategy – the entrepreneurial spirit – using the necessary funds, and coordinate their training-related activities more closely;</p>
<p class="contents">- Thirdly, we must highlight the important role of the social partners in promoting access to training so that workers can achieve more and better qualifications and skills; the participation of the social partners is also crucial to monitoring the action plan at European, national and regional level;</p>
<p class="contents">- Fourthly, Community legislation on the mutual recognition of qualifications must be more strictly applied;</p>
<p class="contents">- Fifthly, youth exchange programmes, the awareness of cultural diversity, linguistic ability and citizenship must all be encouraged throughout training;</p>
<p class="contents">- Sixthly, in order to combat the under-representation of women in high-technology sectors, support must be provided for the adoption of training actions and for the introduction of information and communications technologies and new systems of learning that guarantee women priority access, not forgetting the training and retraining of older workers, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="contents">- Seventhly, the crucial role that teleworking could play as a response to a geographical mobility that workers do not want;</p>
<p class="contents">- Eighthly, the transferability of pensions is one of the most sensitive issues in this area, because pensions constitute a major obstacle to mobility, and workers who have acquired rights to a pension in their Member State could risk being unable to transfer these rights. Directive 98/49/EC and Regulation 1408/71 must, therefore, be updated, simplified and extended and the coexistence of situations of double taxation with those in which this does not apply must finally be eliminated; a further major contribution to fostering geographical mobility is the creation of the European health insurance card, which is expected to be up and running in 2004;</p>
<p class="contents">- Ninthly, we must highlight the use of the Eures system, although this must be extended and brought up to date. I shall now address the Commission, so that it takes account of the importance of this instrument and fulfils the good intentions expressed in its communication on this particular aspect; the objective of transparency and of centralising information on employment opportunities within the Union can be achieved through the creation of a one-stop site providing information on mobility as well as campaigns aimed at individual industries. I would also highlight the fact that the candidate countries must combat the brain drain in this area; we must help them to create their own structures for innovation and to promote the exchange of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States, local authorities, employers, social partners and Community institutions must actively seek to ensure the success of this action plan and the measures that have now been presented must be taken into account in the revision of the European Employment Strategy</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bastos on her report and her presentation of it and to thank the rapporteur of the Committee of the Regions, Mrs Arnold, for her input. The action plan for skills and mobility consists of 25 points designed to give the citizens of the European Union greater mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the objective of the action plan is to remove obstacles to living, working and studying between one Member State and another. The objective is not, by any stretch of the imagination, to make mobility compulsory; it is to put conditions in place which make it easier for anyone who so wishes to move within the European Union. The Commission is delighted at how well Parliament has received the action plan and with its support for these measures which, as you know, were approved by the High-Level Task Force on Skills and Mobility as the most suitable way of improving the conditions upon which mobility and lifelong learning for our citizens depend.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's report contains a number of undertakings which are even more ambitious than those made by the Commission in the action plan, although I have to say that, given the priorities laid down in part by the Barcelona Council, the Commission has endeavoured to make the action plan as realistic and feasible as possible, taking account of the legislative procedures required in order to keep to the proposed deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan contains a series of specific targets which will be used to evaluate its success over coming years and we shall, of course, need a number of indicators in order to assess its progress. These indicators will be defined together with the Member States. We need the Member States to be actively involved at all levels, especially as a great many measures under the action plan are largely measures for which the Member States have jurisdiction. I should like to point out that we need coordination and we need collaboration between the Member States on education and vocational training, especially when it comes to the mobility of young people, exchanges of best practices and transparent professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the initiative by the Commission and the Member States, the Council will issue a resolution on 12 November on reinforcing cooperation in the field of vocational training. The point of reinforced cooperation is to improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational training overall and to address the lack of transparency and mutual trust hampering the recognition of professional qualifications and skills from one country to another. The implementation of the plan is under way, legislative proposals have been submitted, new procedures have been designed and the Council has been urged to take decisions on the proposals already tabled. The Commission has made provision for close collaboration with the social partners, especially on two points: first, on the question of lifelong learning and, secondly, on the facility to transfer supplementary pension rights. More specifically, especially on the matters addressed by Mrs Bastos, there are already plans to set up a website containing information on job mobility by the end of the year, so that European citizens can obtain information on the European job market and a number of other areas to do with mobility. It will also provide a direct link to the learning opportunities website which will be up and running in 2003. The Commission is to pass a decision revising the Eures system, so that it efficiently supports the mobility of European manpower, the objective being for Eures to provide services and information both to job seekers and to companies looking to recruit at European level. Thirdly, the Commission will be tabling its proposal on the European health insurance card at the beginning of 2003, which Parliament already knows about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention two horizontal issues. First, there is room to improve the position of women across the board and the gender dimension must be taken into account in all individual measures and, secondly, we face an important challenge in the run up to enlargement: Parliament has voiced its concern about the danger of a manpower drain from east to west; this sort of mass exodus would create a huge problem for the candidate countries. The connection between immigration and employment is to be discussed at a joint OECD/European Commission conference in January 2003. In the meantime, the Commission is discussing a draft directive from last year on conditions of entry and residence for third country nationals looking for paid employment or freelance work, so as to ensure that the Member States take a common approach on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan for skills and mobility is a very complicated and ambitious plan containing a whole host of measures which, if they are to be implemented, require very close collaboration between the European institutions and the social factors and social partners. May I make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and interest which it has shown in this plan right from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The concept of putting employment in a central place in the Presidency programme is absolutely right and sets exactly the right tone and example not just for us but indeed for successive presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some general remarks and then touch on my report. Certainly it is fair to say that generally, Member States and this Parliament too often skate around the important issue of employment. There is much talk but little action and such action as there is often unhelpful. Certainly my own country sets a rather poor example in this respect. Last year 4 600 employment regulations were introduced. That is one every 26 minutes. That is hardly the way ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not enough for us to have separate programmes and projects, welcome as those may be. It is not enough just to set targets whether for young people, women, the long-term unemployed etc., and then sit back and watch. It is not enough to focus so firmly on job protection, trying to keep current jobs alive even when the market has moved on. We need to focus on job creation, which means liberating enterprise. We need to recognise that the greatest engine of employment growth in all our countries is the sector called 'small and medium-sized enterprises'. We must help them succeed and thrive and not hold them back. We need to realise that full employment helps create social inclusion and not the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Council said, and I repeated this in my report, that we need to encourage a regulatory climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in general. Two years on, we have simply added to the burdens on business, and high unemployment in continental Europe is our own fault.</p>
<p class="contents">I am heartened, however, by the lead that the Danish Presidency is trying to give and I would like to thank Minister Frederiksen in particular for a most helpful letter that he sent me on 18 September. I am sure he will not be embarrassed if I share with colleagues just one paragraph which is very pertinent to our topic of discussion today:</p>
<p class="contents">'My clear stand is that the European Union should only step in with legislation where there is an obvious need for such regulation and, in such cases, only to the necessary extent. There should be room for manoeuvre at the national level and if regulation is introduced it should, in my view, to the highest possible extent, be in the form of framework directives rather than detailed rules. There should also, wherever possible, be a freedom of choice as to the method of implementation as is, for instance, the case in connection with the open coordination method in the employment and social field. Finally I would like to emphasise that I also attach great importance to the principle of subsidiarity.'</p>
<p class="contents">Those are extremely wise words and we all look forward to them being translated into action. Similarly, the comments from Commissioner Prodi back in July saying that the intention was to simplify regulation by at least 25%, and to do that with all speed, is also to be welcomed. Again, we wish to see some flesh put on those particular commitments as soon as possible, preferably again under your leadership and presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the growth and employment initiative is concerned, I was delighted that this was approved unanimously in committee and that we had made some progress in becoming lighter on our feet. The first report on this multi-annual programme was in January 2001. The second year's report was made only 11 months later, and this year the report is actually in October. Next year I would like to make it earlier still, and I would look for the earliest possible feedback from the Commission to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, however, I would like to point out how much I welcome the Commission's cooperation in providing information and updates at regular intervals. I welcome the progress that has been made and in particular the way that the programme has been managed and has developed. I would like to see some clear responses and some action regarding the proposals made by the Parliament both last year and indeed this time around. Very simply, I would like to see the next Commission report show that it has not only read Parliament's report but has actually responded to it. This means including a fuller analysis of certain aspects of the initiative and also the winding up of the Joint European Venture, the JEV Programme, in its current form.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded that at the end of the debate in December on exactly this subject, Commissioner Liikanen accosted me just after he finished speaking and asked whether the Parliament agreed with winding up the JEV Programme, because this was what the Commission very much wanted to do. I told him that Parliament did indeed want to see the programme wound up. He said he was very relieved to hear that and would now get on with it.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, I have not seen much action in winding the programme up. The Commission needs to be much quicker and lighter on its feet on such issues, but then, so do we all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, we received the report by the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the third report on the growth and employment initiative with a great deal of interest. I especially appreciated the rapporteur's spirit of collaboration and his comments on our annual report and would point out that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs found the European Commission's report to be detailed and that the Commission had responded to the European Parliament's request for the report to be presented earlier. And, of course we had excellent relations and worked closely with the rapporteur, as is clear from the position taken by Mr Bushill-Matthews.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall reply by dividing my comments into three entities. First, the provision of information to Parliament and the relevant timetable, secondly geographical coverage and thirdly prospects and funding.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the provision of information is concerned, although completing formal procedures is time-consuming, the European Commission has continued to apply its practice of updating the rapporteur at regular intervals before completing the official procedure. And, it has endeavoured to provide quarterly information on the financial application of the programmes managed by the European Investment Fund on an unofficial basis. In reply to your call in connection with so-called pre-start financing by financing intermediaries under the SME Guarantee Facility, I should point out that this pre-start financing is granted to certain small and medium-sized enterprises because they are in the start-up phase; they do not need to be officially recognised before the loan is granted and they are, of course, selected by the financing intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as geographical and sectoral coverage is concerned, the European Investment Fund has managed to achieve relatively satisfactory coverage of all countries despite the recession on all the money markets. It has managed to commit all the available funds in thirteen Member States. The reason it is so hard to apply the European Technology Facility Start-Up Facility or ΕΤF Start-up Facility is because the facility itself has not got off to a uniform start in every country; there are various problems with its application which are due in part to the fact that national venture capital markets are at different stages of development and, of course, in part to the 50% contribution, which is not easy to find; countries with an underdeveloped venture capital market find it hard, if not impossible to meet this second criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we need to look at the overall geographical distribution of all SME funding mechanisms, rather than at each one separately. We also believe that we need to divide the budget between the various SME funding mechanisms within this framework with the right degree of flexibility, taking account of market demand rather than just responding to the need for geographical coverage. I should point out that the European Investment Fund has always endeavoured to channel funding to countries where there is little demand. As far as sectoral coverage is concerned, I should like to point out that the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises to have benefited from these funds belong to traditional sectors. Bearing this in mind, it is true to say that the Fund's start-up facility is targeted at high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises and that over 90% of the beneficiaries of the SME start-up facility are micro enterprises with fewer than 10 employees, mainly in the services, craft, manufacturing and commercial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, prospects for financial instruments. The survival of programmes which benefit small and medium-sized enterprises is guaranteed under the multiannual programme on enterprise and entrepreneurship, which is now also open to candidate countries. The European Investment Fund hopes to start negotiating contracts before the end of 2002, by signing memoranda of understanding with these countries and completing financial procedures. As far as the European Technology Facility Start-Up Facility presented in the 2001 annual report is concerned, the revaluation of fast-growth innovative enterprises and the huge losses sustained by investors as a result have completely upset the market and there appears to be little likelihood of any change here in the future. We also need to bear in mind that, with slow economic growth, increased competition on the European markets, the restructuring of the banking sector and the demand for shareholder value, banks are unwilling to grant or renew loans to risky small and medium-sized enterprises. Of course, when part of the risk is underwritten by public-sector bodies, there is still a chance that banks will offer loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, the market demand for the SME start-up facility is still fairly high and we believe that the candidate countries will generate additional demand once they join.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Joint European Venture or JEV is concerned, the Commission agrees with Mr Bushill-Matthews' remarks that the programme had a limited impact as far as job creation is concerned and was not cost effective. There was limited demand on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises and considerable delays in processing applications, due to the fact that the Commission had to apply strict procedures in order to minimise the risk of irregularity and protect the Community's economic interests. This being so, the Commission agrees with Parliament that the Joint European Venture should be shut down.</p>
<p class="contents">The final evaluation of the growth and employment initiative should be completed and be ready for submission to Parliament in November 2002. At the end of the consultation period, the Commission will submit a proposal to the Council in March or May 2003 for a Council decision amending the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship and possibly shutting down the specific initiative on the Joint European Venture.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two words about evaluation: the period covering the budget allocated to the financial instruments managed by the European Investment Fund expired on 29 May 2002, that is, four years after the Council decision was issued. Consequently, the evaluation report was scheduled for submission after that date, so that account could be taken of the full 48-month budgetary period.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one comment, Mr President, on the original approach taken by Mr Bushill-Matthews. Clearly the initiatives I referred to form part of the multiannual programme on small and medium-sized enterprises. The conclusion drawn from all the analyses and investigations is that one of the most serious problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises is financing and that this is a real problem throughout the European Union. All these European Commission initiatives, the guarantee funds, the Joint European Venture, technological backing for companies, are pilot programmes to find new financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises, some of which are successful and some of which are not and all of which depend on how dynamic and well-developed the markets are in the Member States. But we believe that, in all cases, the outcome is positive because we work with the Member States, new instruments come on to the market and we always find the model to suit the country and the SME sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are therefore a key political priority. The relevance of small and micro-enterprises was recognised by the Feira European Council. This is why they should benefit from the EU financial instruments to a much greater degree than they have so far. To achieve this, the Commission urgently needs to recognise and readdress three areas. I am not entirely satisfied with the explanations we have had from the Commissioner. The Commission needs to tackle the lack of information SMEs and micro-enterprises have about these programmes. Access to information about how to get financing is an essential starting point for encouraging entrepreneurship and SMEs' activities. Therefore, the Commission and Member States need to launch campaigns to give SMEs clear and simple information on how to benefit from EU projects and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is too much red tape and too many complicated financing procedures. These need to be eliminated. In Europe, SMEs have to face many more obstacles when accessing financing than is the case for SMEs in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard about the Joint European Venture Programme and why it has failed. We must look at the figures. One of the reasons is that one in five projects was refused by the Commission or withdrawn due to the level of administrative requirements. This needs to be investigated. Also, the Commission failed to put in place the groundwork before they launched the JEV Programme because it was not marketed in some states, there were no intermediaries, and if you look at the UK, there was only one. This meant that the programme was doomed to fail from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in my region there are many micro-enterprises and SMEs who would have welcomed the opportunity to be involved in this programme. I hope that its successor will address some of these problems because this programme is important, especially for the candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The goal of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world will not be realised without a skilled labour force, for which mobility is practically possible, and even welcome. In its opinion, however, the Committee on Culture also highlights the broader objectives of a basic education and its fundamental importance. It likewise urges the Commission to exploit information technology in the promotion of virtual mobility and new ways of learning and working.</p>
<p class="contents">Although education is the responsibility of the Member States, we also need common actions and objectives. In 2000 the number of those who received further education at the very least varied among the Member States from 78% right down to less than 20%. It will be difficult to establish a firm basis for competitiveness unless we raise levels of education.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems associated with the comparability of qualifications greatly hamper labour mobility. This year we are celebrating the millionth Erasmus student, but in reality we still have a lot of problems compensating for studies undertaken abroad. In this regard we are expecting much from the Bologna and Bruges Processes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Action Plan quite rightly emphasises the fact that education systems must improve their ability to answer the needs of the labour market. If education systems are made more flexible it will be possible, for example, to heighten interest in mathematics and the natural sciences. Several Member States have embarked on separate projects in these areas. Hopefully, the Commission will be able to pick up examples of good practice from these projects for others to make use of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst it is the lack of jobs rather than the lack of mobility which is the main problem for the unemployed in Europe, the issues identified by the Commission taskforce are very important. I would like to make a few specific points that were highlighted by the Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities Committee:</p>
<p class="contents">First, gender mainstreaming is a requirement for all Commission documents, but an annex to this action plan explaining how it was done in this case would not only help ensure that the measures are adhered to, but would also demonstrate how mainstreaming was achieved in a practical way. This would be a good example for other policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, regional initiatives are proposed to support training for women in occupations where they are not equally represented. The revised Equal Treatment Directive allows Member States to provide such additional vocational training in areas such as the scientific sector and this should be built on in the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the action plan proposes the formation of industrial, educational and other advisory bodies. Whilst I know that membership of these bodies is not always within the Commission's jurisdiction, a clause requiring the Commission to ensure equal representation when possible sends everyone involved a very clear message that this is desirable and expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Geographical mobility means more, of course, than simply getting a job in a different place. There are other issues to be taken into account, particularly for workers with children: access to housing, social services, good quality education and childcare. The report makes several points which I welcome and which are important to women, such as qualifying periods for supplementary pension rights – as mentioned by the Commissioner – and the use of best practice to encourage more young women to take an interest in mathematics, science and technology. I hope Parliament will support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pronk (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank both the Council and the Commission warmly for their introduction, but I should also particularly like to thank both our PPE-DE rapporteurs, Mrs Regina Bastos and Mr Philip Bushill-Matthews, for their reports. After all, it is important not just to debate the general aspect, but also to address two very specific components of the employment issue.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the SMEs which are, of course, of key importance to the economic structure, and Mrs Bastos' report which naturally mainly concerns the labour market structure and the EU's education and training structure. If these are not kept in step with each other, then something is wrong. At present, the economy is, of course, not in terribly good shape. This will undoubtedly have an impact on the labour market. We already know this and we should be prepared for this. This is why I wonder whether the Council is not a little too upbeat. Is it not relying too much on figures from the recent past, when growth and the development of productivity were far better than now?</p>
<p class="contents">A second question that can be addressed to the Council is, of course, whether they are not being overly optimistic in combining all these processes. We are certainly not opposed to this, but are we not in danger of creating another Johannesburg Summit of some kind, or to put it in biblical terms, a Tower of Babel, with all these processes happening simultaneously? Will this produce any extra benefits? This is my second question.</p>
<p class="contents">A question I should like to ask the Commission, one that is related to what I said on a general note, is the issue of whether the Commission takes account of its own directives. I am very aware of the fact that as soon as a social directive is issued, very extensive discussions on employment will follow immediately. This is currently the case with, for example, the directive on working conditions for temporary staff. There are also other directives, though, in the field of the economy itself or in the field of annual reporting, and there are many complaints, also from SMEs, that these directives are very detrimental to employment. I will give you an example that occurred this week, namely Commissioner Bolkestein's Take-Over Directive. This directive will almost certainly cost tens of thousands of jobs in the Netherlands and in Germany and, in time, will undermine the present social system. Is this taken into consideration in the Commission's decision-making process? Does consideration of how many jobs will be lost come into it at all? Or is the focus in respect of these inherently sound intentions on the social directives? If this were the case, this would, in my view, be wrong. I would therefore like to find out from the Commission whether this was the case here, and if not, whether this is likely to happen in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, we are still facing a difficult situation in the area of employment. I think that a number of things can still happen at EU level. I would, for example, mention the issue of the arms industry, which is very badly regulated in Europe, and where we could achieve far better employment levels but also far better efficiency than at present. I know that a lot of people would prefer not to talk about this too much but would rather leave this to the course of time. This too is therefore a problem that I believe we need to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think we should still be very careful not to look exclusively and excessively to America, and to believe that they do everything better than we do. We have seen a few recent cases – it is enough for me to mention Enron, but also the current strike on the west coast – in which the United States does not do so well. I would urge the Council and the Commission mainly to try to adopt the good things that are happening in the United States and not too many of the bad things, and also not to think that we are doing so badly on all scores. We often do much better than we think. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my speech, I wish to concentrate on employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that there has been an evaluation after five years. It is important to see what has worked well, what has not worked so well and where there is room for improvement. The Council is right in saying that it is the result which counts in the end. The overall results for the past five years are, however, fairly good. There has been an increase in active employment measures, unemployment has fallen, and employment has risen accordingly. If we compare the way we have tackled employment during various phases of recession, we can confirm that this recession is a great improvement on the last, even if unemployment is rising at present in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject now of the proposed changes themselves and their extent, it is certainly the case that the pillar structure is not an end in itself, but it is important that a number of different aspects are included in employment strategy. Here, I am of course talking about the targets of a rise in employment and a fall in unemployment, an increase in employment for women, high-quality employment and aspects of work organisation. There is one more aspect that no one has mentioned, which is that sustainable development must be integrated into employment strategy as it is into the other two strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that has been expressed on stability. We should not step in and make changes every year. Unless there are any particular developments, these processes should be allowed to continue for a number of years. I also share the view as regards focus. It becomes difficult if there are too many indicators and targets. We need to focus on the most important goals, and we need to take care of implementation and results.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding openness and the participation of partners, I wish to emphasise what has been said about the social partners. They already play a central role, and there are reasons for increasing their participation in the employment strategy. There are, however, some shortcomings, especially in the field of democratic control. There is a lack of influence on the part of the European Parliament on overall strategy, and a lack of influence on the part of the national parliaments regarding implementation and Member States’ national action plans. These issues are important. We cannot let such important issues be decided behind closed doors by employees’ associations. We must have proper democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">When we coordinate the processes, however, no one process is more important than another. The economic process is just as important as the social and employment-policy processes, and we must also bring in the social guidelines when we synchronise the processes. All of this is important. If there is anyone who should be doing the coordinating it is the General Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us to try to attain the Lisbon goals and for this purpose, we must certainly develop the area of employment and training. I therefore welcome this proposal. We must learn from the past, for without the past, there is no future. In order to achieve the goals agreed in Lisbon, however, we will also need to consider better labour mobility, and I particularly have the border regions in mind. We need more harmonisation and more cooperation in the tripartite system of government, industry and knowledge institutes, mainly in order to stimulate working across borders. This is why I have tabled an amendment to promote this. Fortunately, the Committee on Budgets has already adopted an amendment to this effect and I hope that the same can be done in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the transnational labour and knowledge potential that is available is still very much under-utilised, and this must improve. Furthermore, we should in future consider the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and diplomas, something that we are, in fact, already addressing to a large extent. Eventually, however, the cross-border harmonisation of social security systems, social policy and even tax policy will also need to improve. I assume that the Council will deal with this and will be tabling proposals in due course, particularly with a view to promoting this mobility and the exchange of knowledge across the borders, for as we know, there are very few Europeans who move from one region to another, particularly to look for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Pronk, I should like to point to the Americans, who have no difficulty whatsoever in looking for another job within a one thousand kilometre radius. As for his comment on take-over bids, I should like to note that in my view, European enterprises are better able to run as a result, and if they run better within the internal market, this will eventually lead to better investments and thus to more employment. As you see, Mr President, it is possible for us to have different views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I am pleased that both the Commission and the Council so clearly identify with and advocate the Lisbon strategy, with its clear aims and its talk of economic growth, full employment and social considerations in balance with each other. It is very important to achieve a balanced employment policy, where a number of different interests stand side by side.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is good that the Commission speaks so clearly about the prospects for implementing employment strategy. We have had the problem that there have been a lot of good ideas, but with mediocre results when it comes to realising them in the Member States. It is important that the European Employment Strategy be coordinated with national employment policies. In this connection, the parliaments are a key factor, because they allocate the budgets for the national employment strategies. I think that it was good, therefore, that Mr Hjort Frederiksen, as well as the Commission, emphasised the role of the parliaments. I should, however, like a clarification. It is good that the parliaments are to play a greater role. Is there a firm commitment for them to hold debates and for them to take decisions? As we know, the parliaments do take decisions on national employment strategies. Is there another, different, European employment strategy which the parliaments should not be allowed to take decisions on? That is a practical question.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to bring up something Mrs Diamantopoulou said, which I had heard earlier; that is, the meaning of stability as far as the guidelines are concerned. I can understand this wish for stability, and I fully share the view that there must be stability in the goals. The guidelines also speak of the means, however, and I am slightly more doubtful about the contention that the means must be just as stable. I believe that we must keep a grip on reality and focus on what is tangible.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say by way of conclusion that both the<span class="bold"> </span>enlargement process, with its very particular problems for the candidate countries, and the recent rise in unemployment present new challenges which demand a sense of reality. It must not then be said that the means have to be extremely stable and unchanging year by year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall keep my comments brief, for small groups have little speaking time. I thank our fellow MEPs Mrs Bastos and Mr Bushill-Matthews for their contributions. I should like to outline a number of key areas. We are discussing the revision of the employment strategy. If we look at the current guidelines, and the priorities as they are at present formulated, then it is clear that the employment strategy has, in fact, partly been overtaken by the Lisbon process, and the Lisbon process, has, in turn, been overtaken by an economic downturn. This means that a great number of things are actually in the balance. Labour participation targets are probably not realistic; there is no employment; it is only possible to offer incentives if employment is on offer and if the offer of employment is promoted. The question is, however, whether we are always able to do this. I am very interested to find out about these new guidelines and also very interested to see what we can get rid of.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we sum this up? I can understand that things are different for youth unemployment, but a number of other types of work, such as jobs for the elderly, cannot always be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome new guidelines and do not believe there is always a need for pillars. These guidelines should, however, be clear and simple, just like the new relationship with ESF and the funds. With regard to streamlining, I actually endorse Mr Pronk's view on this, namely that streamlining and integration are closely connected. If we talk about integration, we should also take account of the economic and socio-economic policy aspects in the re-assessment of what we refer to as the social and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask the Commissioner or the Council why the Social Security Directive has not, to date, been reviewed. I have seen the annotated agenda and cannot make out any progress. I wonder when this will happen when we talk about flexibility on the one hand and social security on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are a number of things we should do – and we can choose whether or not to do them – at national level. Here are a few considerations. I feel, for example, that the constant focus on the action of the social partners is not just excessive but is in danger of leading us along a path which will increase the rigidity of the labour market, the path of protecting workers and firms that are already part of the production cycle and providing them with guarantees, safeguards and opportunities, in other words protecting those inside the labour market and the economy and thus creating greater barriers for those outside the market, those who need it most, those who are seeking work.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards intracommunity mobility – and I feel this is an important goal – I believe that we must concentrate on creating the right conditions for effective access to this mobility. I would point out, however, that there are mobility problems within the Community and within the individual countries, and I am thinking here of Italy, for example, where there is extremely little, if any, labour mobility within the country because of labour market legislation, because of national collective agreements – and I hope that nobody is going to propose European collective agreements for the different sectors of the labour market – agreements which do not recognise specific situations or even the different benefits that the individual areas might present for an efficient labour market; we therefore need to create worker mobility but also investment mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of the same subject is the mobility of professional labour and professional categories of workers. Many countries such as Italy have a corporative system for regulating the professions, which makes access impossible since the partners would be bound to the corporations and creates a legislative barrier to mobility, for example to access in Italy for those who wish to exercise some of the most important liberal professions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must reflect on this issue, and we must also reflect on the fact that it might be better for Europe to concentrate on the need for a constant increase in the role of the social partners rather than trying to introduce the most effective market rules possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As employment statistics show, labour market reforms have not, unfortunately, been strong enough to create the sort of momentum which translates into new jobs, to the point that, even in countries such as Greece which has growth of around 4%, unemployment is still a problem. This means that growth does not always bring jobs, mainly due to weaknesses and rigidity on the labour market, such as the difficulty young people and women have accessing the labour market, the mismatch between the demands of the labour market and the skills of graduates of our educational establishments and the survival in numerous areas of the Union of anachronistic and outdated perceptions of work and the value of women's work.</p>
<p class="contents">The new generation of guidelines on employment you referred to, Commissioner, need to take account of the fact that the labour market is still, unfortunately, split along the gender divide, that women earn less than men, that only 25% of companies are owned by women and that the glass ceiling is still very firmly in place. I think that quality of work, which is the core concept of the guidelines, sustainable development and individualised rights may well be the driving force behind longer careers for women and I should also like to stress, as Mrs Evans said on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, that the new employment strategy should be predicated on mainstreaming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Chapter II of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, entitled ‘Freedoms’, in Article 15, tells us that 'Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of establishment and to provide services in any Member State'. I believe that this article should be promoted to the category of a fundamental right in terms of the free movement of services and persons. However, there are still many obstacles to the mobility of the workforce, qualified or non-qualified, between the Member States, which prevents us from having European labour markets open to all and, probably, as a logical consequence of this, causes territorial imbalances and situations of injustice, social exclusion or poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all obstacles to the achievement of the objective set at the Lisbon European Council and ratified at the Barcelona European Council. The European Union must become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, accompanied by more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need to modify and simplify social security systems and enshrine the principle of the transferability of supplementary pension rights. It would be appropriate, and perhaps necessary, to create a mobility plan which has a real effective impact on the lives of the citizens, and mainly in specific regions such as cross-border areas, with the involvement of the local authorities, reinforcing the local dimension of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This impact must also be felt in specific material areas and areas of competence, such as the service economy and the environment and of course, with the participation of social agents, in a fluid and easy communication between the professional and educational sectors, taking particular account of the importance of training and education systems in relation to the development of a culture of mobility, creating horizontal policies, such as policies on equality and others, because the different options are not exclusive and self-contained compartments, but part of a whole, a series of actions intended to develop the European social model and realise the principles that certain visionaries – I say this with respect – perceived more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, as the Commissioner has said, it is a question of those who want to move around throughout the European Union being able to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been informed, to my great surprise, that it was impossible to reach agreement on the tripartite social dialogue summit during that meeting, and in my view, one of the very things that are important in the employment strategy and that we must try to promote is to involve the social partners in this employment strategy based on their responsibility in wage-base determination and working conditions policy. I should like to express my great astonishment and sadness at this and ask him why no agreement could be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two comments on the report by Mr Bushill-Matthews, who has for the second time drafted a report of this kind on this annual report and whose shadow rapporteur I have now been for the second time. I am also a little surprised at the fact that the report features on the agenda of this plenary meeting, since we tried very hard to reach agreement within the committee on a number of important points.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two observations to make in this connection. Firstly, with regard to the JEVs, that is, the joint ventures with the accession countries, I fully endorse what Mrs Gill has said on the subject, namely that it is important to analyse carefully why that project is running so badly, whether this is indeed due to the publicity, the bureaucracy and long-winded administrative procedures, and whether it is not regrettable to mess up a project of this kind if there is a possibility that the procedures might be improved. I should like to ask the Commission to pay particular attention to matters of this kind during this assessment, because I believe that it could in itself present a very important opportunity to promote entrepreneurship and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns Mr Bushill-Matthews' report. I should like to briefly draw attention to the request that has also been included in his report to obtain a report from the Commission about corporate social responsibility and the SME. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the question of mobility, which is very limited – the statistics have already been quoted and there is no need to repeat them. I merely want to point out that this abysmal state of affairs is not just a weakness in the market. It is illustrative of the weaknesses and difficulties inherent in European unification. It is a complex issue to do with education, vocational training, social insurance, taxation and, of course, language skills. So we have our work cut out in all sectors and at all levels; at national level, where we need to coordinate and mobilise central policies, the social partners and local policies on employment, and at European level, where we need constant coordination and initiative. At both levels we need to set clear targets and timetables, as the rapporteur has pointed out and, more to the point, we need policies which are coordinated without overlapping.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also suggest that we need to make use of important instruments for finding innovative ways of promoting mobility, such as Article 6 of the European Social Fund. In its resolution, the European Parliament calls on the European Commission to take account of this need and of the facility to reset priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words on higher education. The ERASMUS programme, which has already been mentioned, and the figure of one million students moving round Europe do not add up to a serious endeavour to increase the cross-cultural dimension of education and to familiarise students with educational systems and prepare them to become mobile European workers. They need to be prepared at all stages of their education and we need to make it easier for students to move from one university to another. One study, albeit somewhat superficial, of the differences between the systems and the lack of reception facilities for students moving from one university to another illustrates quite clearly that the borders to education have yet to fall and that this is an area on which we need to bring initiative and daring to bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trentin (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Bastos’ excellent report highlights the dual necessity to integrate Eures into the Member States’ employment services and to involve local authorities and the social partners in the activities of Eures so as to bring about ever-increasing decentralisation of labour mobility initiatives. It will thus be possible to enhance and extend cross-border cooperation in training, the recognition of qualifications and the protection of pension rights, to which the social partners have made a decisive contribution with the promotion by Eures of at least 39 interregional trade union councils in the territories bordering on the States of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This experience must be exploited and must certainly not go to waste, which is what would happen if the interregional trade union councils were detached from Eures and their existence and the funding of their activities somehow made dependent on the goodwill of each individual Union State, as would appear to be the intention of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for greater involvement of the Member States in the funding and running of Eures and the associated structures is certainly something we support, but the form and extent of this involvement can only be defined at Community level and involve all the Member States jointly and severally: in other words, it must not lead to the Commission casting off its responsibility for the running or even the continued existence of the interregional trade union councils.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore tabled an amendment before the House with the consent of the rapporteur, Mrs Bastos, which proposes that the Commission and the Council be asked for reassurance on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Commission’s Action Plan, which contains practical measures for creating a more favourable environment for the European labour market by 2005, making it more open and accessible for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to find included a number of recommendations which I and Mr Evans made two years ago in our report on mobility within the Community, in particular the mobility of students, people undergoing training and people doing voluntary work as well as teachers and researchers. Then, last but certainly not least, there is a special section which deals with the mobility of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to go further, however. If, indeed, we want a Europe with more and higher-quality jobs, with greater social cohesion – in other words, if we want to achieve the ambitious but necessary Lisbon objectives – it is essential that we continue to concentrate on eliminating once and for all those barriers which still exist, restricting the professional and geographical mobility of the European citizens and, indeed, limiting their potential.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to let this absurd situation continue any longer. It is easier for money, goods and services to move within the European Union than the European citizens themselves. Consider the strategic role of the local authorities, the opportunities provided by teleworking and the need to modernise and fully exploit the potential of the Eures system. This is something I stressed in my report on the Sixth Framework-Programme for Research too.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to update and simplify coordination of social security once and for all, speed up revision of Regulation No 1408/71 and address and resolve together the complex issue of supplementary pensions. A key issue, then, which Mr Zappalà is currently addressing in committee, is that of academic and vocational qualifications and the mutual recognition thereof. We must, at last, achieve that European area of qualifications which will complete the reform of the internal market, increasing mobility between the different Member States of the Union considerably. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Commissioner Diamantopoulou that, following yesterday’s Council meeting, we now have a common platform for revising the Common Employment Strategy. I also agree that we must use this platform as the basis for a broad debate on future employment in the EU. Let there be no doubt that the debate is open to all players and that the role of the European Parliament in this debate is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his observations to the effect that we must create jobs in practice. It is in this area that the European Employment Strategy must be put to the test and demonstrate its worth. I should also like to express my thanks for the many practical proposals contributed by Mr Bushill-Matthews for promoting employment in Europe and increasing flexibility in the European labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also keen to stress, as several other speakers have done, that the two sides of industry must take an active part in the process. They must feel that they own the process and so feel an obligation to participate. I know that the basic conditions for doing so vary from one Member State to another, but it is on a day-to-day basis that the results are to be achieved, and I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament are emphasising this.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have unfortunately to say to Mrs van den Burg that she has misunderstood the outcome of yesterday’s Council meeting. I agree completely that the social dialogue and the tripartite summit are important, which is why we scheduled these matters for discussion over lunch at yesterday’s Council meeting, where it was agreed that we should establish a tripartite social dialogue summit. We shall therefore try to have this endorsed at the next Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Herman Schmid that, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot at this time present practical models for closer cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, but we look forward to hearing this matter discussed and to having the practical options and proposals on the table over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to Mr Bouwman that we in the Council should very much like to see the various socio-political directives revised. One of the things I would point out is that the current modernisation of EEC Regulation 1408/71 on social security schemes for employed persons moving within the Community is on the agenda of the Council’s December meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Mr Andersson for his contribution. We are in complete agreement on a great many matters. We must be focused in our approach and see to it that matters are implemented in such a way that there is democratic scrutiny of all our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should again like to emphasise that, for the people of Europe, it is the results that count. When all is said and done, an increase in prosperity is conditional upon those who are unemployed obtaining jobs. People must get off passive welfare and into work. New jobs must be created, and the business climate must promote the creation of new, and more, jobs. That is, and remains, the main task.</p>
<p class="contents">We must debate the future Employment Strategy now and over the next few months and, as Mr Herman Schmid stated, we must arrange for the national strategies to fit in with the European strategies, for it is in this area that we can reap the considerable benefits of our combined efforts to promote employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
