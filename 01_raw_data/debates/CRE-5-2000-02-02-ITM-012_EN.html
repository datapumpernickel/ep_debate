<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graça Moura (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, in spite of Article 151 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, culture has been the poor relative in terms of the reduced range of programmes and financial, technical and human resources found for the European project. Some may say that the prevailing objectives fifty years ago when the “European home” in which we now live was founded were more specifically economic and social ones. It may also be said that European policies have suffered, throughout these five decades, from the innumerable and crazy whims that have held sway in a wide variety of situations and for a wide variety of reasons. However, in the spirit of Europe’s founding fathers, we must inevitably bear in mind the model for civilisation which led them to seek to establish lasting conditions for peace. This model for civilisation is rooted in deep cultural diversity. A Europe of national identities can live for a long time in peace and prosperity if this cultural diversity maintains its vitality and eliminates the small-mindedness and aggressiveness caused by resentments which, as a rule, give rise to excessively nationalistic feelings.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If this cultural diversity is to succeed, it is vital that there should be mutual understanding and a sharing of the values of civic humanism, tolerance, knowledge and artistic and other forms of cultural expression which have taken root in Europe’s fertile soil, and which reflect the most noble and profound aspects of the human spirit. Therefore, for this understanding and sharing to be fully possible, they must be based on a concept of culture which involves the crucial dimension of European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that genuine convergence, economic and social cohesion, the single currency, the fight against unemployment and social exclusion and even competition are all necessary to create conditions which can provide greater equality, greater development, a better quality of life, and better opportunities for the people of Europe. There is no doubt that the common security and defence policy could strengthen Europe’s identity and status on the world scene. There is no doubt that we aim to gain acceptance for our policy on defending human rights throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If, however, cultural policies cannot give a superior and clearly distinctive meaning to all of this, neither Europe nor European democracy will be able to make much progress. It is through culture alone that millions upon millions of our citizens are able to recognise themselves as Europeans and can cultivate, develop and broaden this feeling of being part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Madam President, is the kind of impetus that European politics needs. We talk about culture, cultural cooperation, symbolic action, major initiatives and networks of cultural agents and operators, but any mention of the European institutions having a cultural policy is carefully avoided. This, by the way, would not impinge on the principle of subsidiarity in the slightest. We even speak rhetorically, sometimes in quite reasonable terms, about the importance of culture for the European project, and yet ridiculous appropriations are allocated to programmes supposed to serve over 300 million people, on a permanent, ongoing basis. These programmes are designed to give them access to a heritage that belongs to them and which should stimulate an active and interactive appetite for contact with the highest values and with the great works in which they are represented. The people of Europe whom we represent here have the right to demand a more consistent, effective and above all a more European attitude from the Union’s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">These thoughts are by way of an introduction to this House’s consideration of the joint text of the Culture 2000 programme, which was approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December last year. Let us remember that Culture 2000 establishes a unique financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation. The conciliation procedure yielded satisfactory solutions to almost all the amendments adopted at second reading. This means that Parliament’s basic understanding can reasonably be considered to be have been preserved, particularly the political priority to be given to establishing conditions for actions under the Culture 2000 programme to reach the greatest possible number of people.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budgetary aspects of this, Parliament’s delegation came up against the Council’s intransigence on the issue of increasing the appropriations from the EUR 167 million that were originally earmarked. It was still set on a solution which would mitigate this position. And this was only made possible by Commissioner Reding’s personal commitment to finding a constructive solution. </p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to her, the Commission committed itself to presenting a report before 30 June 2002 on the operation of the programme, in which it will state whether the available financial resources are adequate or not. It may possibly also offer a review of this item. I cannot hide the fact that the success of this proposal will depend in the final analysis on an institutional mechanism being found which corresponds to the basic meaning of the word “conciliation”. Nevertheless, I shall conclude my speech by proposing to this House that it should vote in favour of the joint text adopted by the Conciliation Committee for the Culture 2000 programme and I wish it every success.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it. We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht. For no one is very keen to spend money on culture. Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course. We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect. One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture. It is downright scandalous what goes on! It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to. It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us. We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access. I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner’s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit. It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term “European cultural policy” or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines “Culture 2000” simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more. On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway. Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence. It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council. This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union’s most important programmes. By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up “Culture 2000” are superb. In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had. Congratulations! Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself – I would like to stress this once again – but also as the instrument <span class="italic">par excellence</span> for furthering the European idea. It is also of great importance to citizens. We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road. I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted. Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand. They are like a snake biting its own tail. There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed. As it happens – and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands – negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage. The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result. Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly – and I for one will always advocate this – but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot. Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas. A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind. Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy. So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen. I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect. However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies. This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.

<p class="contents">I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart. Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well – they worked very hard indeed – and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding’s attitude – I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive – but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is shameful! That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity – an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification – then this is indeed a sorry way to end.</p>
<p class="contents">So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress. That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament’s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture<span class="bold"> </span>programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even – and I could say especially – of the unique features of less well-known sectors. We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process. </p>
<p class="contents">We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people. And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known. As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme’s most obvious limitations is the level of funding – we have heard this several times – which censures the fact that the Council at least – certainly not the Commissioner – is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this. </p>
<p class="contents">The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both of them have done a first-class job.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I say that culture is important? Well in simple economic terms, Europe’s culture adds to genuine prosperity. Where would Europe’s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture? But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised. Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat. However, it is not under threat from Europe. Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven’s sake. We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat. What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time. Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe’s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can. That is what Culture 2000 is about.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review. Are we doing enough? And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council. The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council. We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture. It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes. When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status. We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial. Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues. In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries. I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other. Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union’s goals. Cultural activity creates identity. Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual’s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates. We want a colourful Europe. We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity. We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences. That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure. That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say. There is a contradiction in terms – unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee – and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture’s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests. In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order. The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead. The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished. A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap. This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union’s cultural policy activities once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support. Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered. The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro! And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004. That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house’s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years! There is a blatant discrepancy here!</p>
<p class="contents">And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content. Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out. We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day. Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm! Cultural cooperation – and this was also mentioned earlier – truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be. Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions. What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause. However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation. </p>
<p class="contents">The cultural programmes launched in years past – Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael – are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where – and I must stress this here very forcefully – the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection – as someone said this afternoon – but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor. This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening’s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to<span class="bold"> </span>an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past. Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth. Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe? What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question – ‘What is Europe?’ – we answer it by saying, ‘It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.’ That is what Culture 2000 represents. It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty <span class="italic">dans la realité.</span> And more than this – and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require. It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.</p>

Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ‘Culture 2000’ framework programme. We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector. It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this ‘happy ending’ in this House, and I thank you for it. I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution. Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment. It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives. If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper. All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them. It is thanks, too, to Parliament’s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens’ cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale. This is going to lead us to make ‘Culture 2000’ the programme of the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality. I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union. This is what our European ‘Culture 2000’ programme offers. It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States. Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further. It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens’ participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union. A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project. However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme. Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector. Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators. Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.</p>

I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
