<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Members from the different political groups whose amendments have contributed to improving my report, as well as the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade for their opinions and, of course, the officials of this House, whose work has ensured its success.</p>
<p class="contents">My starting point was the Commission’s Communication on a strategic partnership between the European Union and India, of June 2004, and the excellent and well-researched response of the Indian Government in its strategic document of August of the same year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken account of the various meetings held since then by Indians and Europeans and, of course, the 5th bilateral Summit in The Hague, of November of last year, the cornerstone that officially launched the strategic partnership and which accords India the status of privileged partner, similar to that granted to other important countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where possible, I followed the preparations and meetings prior to the 6th bilateral Summit in New Delhi, on 7 September of this year, which gave the green light to the expected joint action plan of the strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in certain areas of the report, I am going further than the Commission and the Council and there can sometimes be a degree of disagreement between my position and theirs, though more because of omissions rather than concrete actions on their part. Nevertheless, I believe that, if my report is approved during tomorrow’s sitting, we will be justified in saying that the three Institutions mentioned – Parliament, Commission and Council – fully share the desire to promote, consolidate and enrich our relationship with the largest democracy in the world, in a manner that benefits both parties mutually. We cannot forget that we are talking about a country, India, which is in fact the largest democracy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is worth pointing out, as I do in the text, that some of the objectives indicated in the Council’s Communication and in the recent joint action plan require specific funding which, if we are serious in our intentions, we must not avoid. Otherwise there will be little point to any political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In this chapter, I propose that Parliament express its support for the strategic partnership prioritising political dialogue, although I would stress that the achievement of the Millennium Objectives and the effective fight against poverty must continue to be the central elements of the Union’s strategic commitment to India. The latter is in itself a political act, because without the political will to approve the appropriate financial resources, no development objectives can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">India is faced with the task of completing the great development project that is already underway. I am working on the basis that she and the Union share the view that trade, investment and free competition are key factors for development, but also that, in order for this to be harmonious and equitable, fundamental social requirements must be taken into account which strengthen economic and social cohesion, the environment and the rights of consumers. I would therefore like to call upon New Delhi to deal rigorously with these factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The day before yesterday – I would like to tell you – the editorial of an influential British daily newspaper said that the honeymoon between the Indian Government and the private economic-financial sector is over and it accused the Indian Government of having allowed the leftist allies – and I quote – of the governmental coalition to block the promised reforms. In spite of this, the daily newspaper explicitly recognises that the Indian economy has the wind behind its sails, growth may exceed 7% this year, business profits are increasing, the information technology sector is growing in strength, the stock exchange is buoyant and huge amounts of capital are still pouring in – end of quote. Nevertheless – according to that newspaper – the Indian Government cannot take credit for any of these achievements, which are due – it says – purely to good luck, past reforms and the efforts of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I quite frankly believe that that influential daily newspaper is being fanciful. I did not know that good luck was an active determining factor for the economy. The fact is – and I shall end here – that India is making progress, as is its strategic relationship with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My five-minute speech has no room for any more. My intentions are laid out in detail in the Explanatory Statement and in the Motion for a Resolution. I would simply like to remind the Indian Government and society of certain issues such as the following: the death penalty must be abolished, the United Nations Convention against Torture must be ratified, it must sign up to the International Criminal Court and it would also be a good idea to sign up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as should Pakistan and Israel, by the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is much food for thought in this report for us to digest. The rapid emergence of India and its impact on the world scene is a phenomenon of tremendous importance. As the new India defines itself economically and politically, the rest of the world, including Europe, must adjust its own vision of this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has clearly indicated that we take India very seriously. The last EU-India summit held two weeks ago endorsed an ambitious joint action plan which provides the framework for a qualitative transformation in the way we engage with India. This action plan paves the way for closer cooperation on shared strategic goals for the development of trade and investment in enhanced cultural cooperation, participation in Galileo and even foresees India's participation in ITER. This action plan provides a roadmap for the concrete implementation of our strategic partnership. We noted the emphasis in the report on the fact that the EU and India, as the largest democracies in the world, share a commitment to values which contribute to global peace and stability. We share fundamental values, be it our commitment to democracy and human rights or a joint attachment to institutions of global governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The new India sometimes seems like one world in a single country. It combines first-class capabilities in information technology, pharmaceuticals and biotech with Third World levels of poverty. Indians buy 2 million mobile phones a month, but 300 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view eloquently expressed in the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle that open trade and increased inward investment are key factors in economic development, but that if such development is to be harmonious, sustainable and equitable it must take into account fundamental social needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is determined to support India's course of economic reform and modernisation. Our regulatory dialogue, student exchanges and scientific cooperation will all serve to underpin ongoing reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relationship with India cannot be built only through bilateral cooperation. We must look forward to working closely with India to make the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Meeting a success. The EU and India must show leadership in bringing the Doha Development Agenda to a successful conclusion and indeed India, as our partner, is in a unique position to make a case for open trade in goods and services as a powerful tool of development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider it positive that the new cooperation framework is not a compilation of individual objectives and means, but reflects an overall approach based on equality and reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">The dynamics of cooperation and the anticipated benefits for both sides alone are sufficient to justify the new endeavour. However, we also need to give an important position to the dissemination of the product of bilateral cooperation in the area of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in which India plays a central role, and within the framework of the global trade system.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion and focusing on the pillar of the economic dimension, especially trade, I wish to observe that the challenge is to further strengthen trade and investment flows.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater opening of the Indian market, which will be beneficial to India itself, economic reforms, which will demonstrate systematic convergence and support for teams in the sector of science and technology are creative meeting grounds for both sides. An eminent opportunity for constructive cooperation, as you yourself said Commissioner, is without doubt the current WTO round, the Doha round.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I trust that the particular weight which India has at G20 will take on the characteristics of a fruitful and creative contribution to bridging the positions between the developed and the developing countries.</p>

We are moving towards a strategic partnership that we hope the Commission and also the European Council will formally consolidate, while we, as the European Parliament, must strongly demand an active role in the area of cooperation with the Indian Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle, has produced an excellent report which, however, requires the ongoing commitment of the European Parliament. The document that we will put to the vote tomorrow is extremely analytical and examines in depth a great many aspects of cooperation between the European Union and India. We are the two largest democracies in the world, working together to promote development and cooperation not only in the economic sphere but also in the social sphere, in order to guarantee a worldwide balance. These two leading powers must form an alliance to guarantee the rule of law, human rights and – I must stress this – the need to protect workers’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, if we want to commit ourselves alongside India to achieving a new balance for peace and development in any shape or form, it is vital that an interparliamentary delegation between the EU and India should be created, that there should be annual meetings between the two parliaments and, in short, that in practical terms our Parliament should guarantee its ongoing commitment to all the items called for in the directive on which we shall vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As chairman of Parliament's delegation covering India, I believe his report is balanced and demonstrates the complex and valuable relationship between the EU and India. It also marks a real turning point in our long-shared history.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and India are natural partners and, as we have heard several times today, two of the largest democracies in the world. In a few decades India will be one of the largest economies in the world. It possesses immense geopolitical strength and it is timely for us to shift our relationship to a higher and a more intensive level. Both the partners are well placed to be significant players in the global, knowledge-based economy. In the words of Tony Blair, it is crucial for the EU and India to create an equal partnership for mutual benefit, especially with our own declining demographic trends and with half of India's population being under 25.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while we often hear about India's highly-developed technical sector, it is important not to forget that there are still huge challenges in India where we could play a pivotal role: poverty and deprivation and over 600 million people reliant on farming. That is why our response needs to be more than just rhetoric. I support what Mr Menéndez del Valle said about needing more resources. The Commission and the Council need to seriously address the request for India for EUR 1 billion each for health and education, recognising that one of our main priorities is the Millennium Development Goals and India makes up 40% of the MDGs. At the same time, the Commission needs to have progressive aid policies that stimulate the entire country and not just certain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond all the warm words, how do we make a difference? Our partnership needs to reach beyond economics, to be more political. We cannot talk about an increasing political dialogue but then set up only a high-level trade group. There is an urgent need to create and upgrade our contacts between parliaments. I really welcome the forum of parliamentarians set up by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, but both sides need to adopt a roadmap for enhanced political dialogue, including parliamentary support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, we must ensure that we establish stronger ties with countries that share our values. The proposed EU-India Strategic Partnership therefore represents an opportunity for both the EU and India and has the potential to have a positive effect on the whole of the South-East Asian region.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is all too easy to see this partnership in purely economic terms, to my mind it represents much more than this. Clearly, India is one of the nations at the forefront of the economic emergence of Asia. In India, we also see a country that has our shared values of democracy, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and free media. There is still much work to do, but all of these factors allow investors to have confidence in their dealings with India and should instil in us the confidence to take these steps towards partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this partnership there will also be scope to raise issues in other areas, whether this be on human rights, child labour, education, development, poverty eradication, women's rights or the rights of minorities. There must always be a willingness to raise these issues with our partners, but always to do so on the basis of equality in exchange for mutual benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">India is a nation rich in culture and history. Its history is intertwined inseparably with European history. These shared experiences provide a solid foundation from which we can build. The growing importance India has in South-East Asia places upon it extra responsibilities. There will be times when we learn from India's experience, but equally, at other junctures, we should be willing to provide our opinion and support to ensure that these responsibilities are fulfilled. It is only by doing so that we can truly give our sincere commitment to the partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In our global village, South-East Asia represents an area of great opportunity and it is here that our relations with India can help bring about peace, stability and closer cooperation between the South-East Asian nations. They, of course, have their issues, whether it be water or self-determination, but there remains here a distinct possibility that South-East Asia could emerge as a closer union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so perhaps I will report to the chairman, but I will cope, which is more than millions of people in the Indian sub-continent can say.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have the astonishing spectacle of the EU pouring funds into the three SEI organisations, relocating thousands of jobs in the call centre software services sector to India, just part of the relocation of so many jobs to Asia. That it makes European unemployment worse is not the point. What is relevant is the reason for the job relocation. We all know why: cheaper products, primarily because workers in that part of the world are paid less than European workers, which means less than the legal minimum European rate. If that is not the case, there is no reason to relocate in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">They will also have longer working hours, actually promoted by three SEIs. Mr Menéndez del Valle actually boasts of up to five-and-a-half hours more per day available. Worse, he admits to unemployment abuses in India, including child labour. So we have cheaper products by breaking EU rules for wages and for the hours worked by employees who, I have no doubt, are often working in circumstances which an EU health and safety inspector would shut down.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the EU is exploiting sweated labour, the same evil practice it is so keen to eradicate here. What a disgrace! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a partnership between democrats. The Union and India are the two largest democracies in the world, as has already been stated in the House. Of course, democracy on the Indian sub-continent is rooted in specific traditions and value systems but it is democracy nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">India is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and also an emerging economic power. It already has observer status at the G7. It is a country of paradoxes, as I was able to observe during the couple of weeks I spent there. On the one hand there is the very latest technological and computer equipment. On the other, as Mrs Gill mentioned earlier, over half a billion people live off farming and 370 million people, almost 35% of the population, live below the poverty threshold. We should also remember that between 17.5 and 35 million children have to work. In addition, India is a country that needs to import 70% of its energy from abroad, and is dependent on foreign support.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not yet know whether India will be granted a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. It might not be appropriate to adjust the composition of that body, as doing so is bound to give rise to strong feelings in various European and non-European states. There is no doubt, however, that Delhi will soon be playing a leading role on the world political and economic stage.</p>
<p class="contents">A strategic partnership between the Union and India is a necessary step in the right direction for both parties. We should not gloss over certain issues such as the as yet unresolved conflict in Kashmir or the fact that the latest round in the so-called cricket diplomacy between India and Pakistan does not take account of the wishes of the people of Kashmir. Above all, it is the people of Kashmir who should be consulted on the future of their region, not just the politicians in Karachi or Delhi.</p>
<p class="contents">Important as it is, that consideration should not be allowed to detract from the fact that India needs the Union and the Union needs India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then India has gone from strength to strength and is now a strategic partner with the EU, which I warmly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">India remains a stable secular democracy, which therefore disproves the Chinese position that size of country is a bar to democracy and human rights. The Sixth EU-India Summit in New Delhi on 7 September between EU Council President Tony Blair, Commission President Barroso and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a great success, with the signing of the joint action plan for an EU-India strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">This sets up a high-level group to study differences over intellectual property rights, anti-dumping and non-tariff barriers. It is clearly in India's interests to join forces in the WTO negotiations to lower protectionist barriers, particularly in services such as accounting, law and finance, as this will free up trade and generate greater investment flows.</p>
<p class="contents">India now has a 220 million-strong middle class and India-EU trade volumes touched USD 35.37 billion last year and are growing at an astonishing 20% per annum. India recently bought Airbus, and in my country we are outsourcing call centres and even healthcare to India, which I – unlike my UKIP colleague – welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">India, though, still only represents 1.5% of the EU's external trade, compared to the EU representing some 20% for India, so the growth potential remains enormous. More could be done to facilitate so-called Mode 4, free movement of professionals – particularly research scientists – and India is now participating, as mentioned, in the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">I was responsible for the amendment to the report asking for India to be granted privileged status in the exchange of information with Europol in fighting terrorism. I was pleased that this was raised at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I thank India that in spite of its Communist Party protest it voted with the US and the EU on an IAEA resolution on Iran's nuclear programme.</p>

The strategic partnership, which was reaffirmed in early September in New Delhi, also contains commitments. I think it would be contradictory if the Commission were to cut the funding for India instead of increasing it; it would be incongruous, somehow.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the EU needs to increase its visibility in India. On the British Prime Minister’s visit, it was often unclear whether he was there as the President of the Council of the European Union or as the Prime Minister of a Member State. We must clear up this confusion; we must make it clear that we are speaking on behalf of the EU and not just of one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the economy has been raised. This is one basis for this strategic partnership. I, too, believe that possibilities for trade have been far from exhausted. Bureaucracy needs to be reduced, barriers dismantled and infrastructure, ports and airports increasingly expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said several times here, fair trade is also needed, however, as well as respect for workers’ rights, the abolition of child labour and respect for intellectual property. This is part of the package, and I absolutely disagree with Mr Clark of UKIP: India is investing in Europe. Thousands of jobs are being created in Europe, too. For example, an IT company was recently established in Northern Ireland, with the creation of 600 jobs. This is not a one-way street, but rather an exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the political issues, I should like to see India showing commitment to multilateralism, for example recognising the International Criminal Court and acceding to the United Nations Convention Against Torture. I believe that both parties have a good deal more planned with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">India’s development in recent decades has been remarkable. Its technological development is looked upon with envy universally, and at the same time it has managed to preserve its multiethnic, multireligious, multicultural and linguistically diverse society. EU-Indian relations are close; we are friends. We have a particularly high regard for the way this, the world’s largest democracy, is trying, through legislation, actively to rectify the defects observable in its society. One example of this is the practice of positive discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Good legislation is not enough, however: time and effort must be invested in its implementation. The Indian Human Rights Commission has already done a remarkable job, but local authorities should also systematically comply with good political decisions. The EU could provide support here by means of its development programmes, for example, which would focus on the fight against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately 35% of India’s billion or more inhabitants live below the poverty line, and a large number of people are still totally deprived of basic rights. The single most significant reason for this is the caste system, which legitimises human inequality. Especially worrying is the plight of women and the more than 160 million Dalits (Scheduled Castes), whose exploitation is socially accepted and commonplace. Those Dalits who try to break away from the caste system by marrying into a higher caste or, for example, by acquiring education or land legally, often become victims of physical violence and social outcasts. Local authorities are all too ready to interpret the law to the benefit of a higher caste. We Members of the European Parliament have on many occasions raised the issue of human rights violations resulting from the caste system, but so far we have seen little practical action on the part of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that industry is talking openly about the leaps in technology that India needs and which the EU can help realise, the EU should be providing India with more tangible support in issues of human rights in order for it to be able to put its excellent political will into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
