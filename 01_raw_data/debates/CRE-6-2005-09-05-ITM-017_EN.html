I was able to ascertain in person that the hand-grenade had indeed been intended for József Kasza. I could only conclude, there in Subotica, that in Serbia-Montenegro’s northern province of Vojvodina, right on the border with the European Union, the series of attacks on national minorities has not come to an end. In fact, the situation has worsened. In documented cases of minority and human rights violations such as this, the European Parliament has a duty to consider the facts and not the self-justifying statements made by the relevant Serb politicians, who are implicated in these incidents. And this approach is particularly warranted in the case of a country with which the EU is preparing to open Association negotiations in the autumn. </p>
<p class="contents">Making use of its budgetary power, the European Parliament also has a duty to use the Community support it provides to Serbia-Montenegro as an instrument to protect that minority. It is also the duty of the European Parliament, by conducting monitoring activities of its own on a more regular basis, to speak up concerning the kind of country the Union is entering into closer relations with. Last, the European Parliament also has a duty not to forget that, alongside József Kasza, there are some 300 000 people belonging to the Hungarian and other minorities in Vojvodina that need to be protected.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In July of this year, the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) published a competition in which, for the first time, candidates from all 25 Member States would be able to take the tests at the same time. Seven hundred new ‘public administrators’, as they are called in EU terminology, are to be recruited, but the language requirements include only the 11 languages of the 15 ‘old’ Member States. This means that a Dutch person is able to take the test in Dutch, while Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovenian, Estonia, Latvian, Lithuanian and Maltese applicants cannot take the test in their mother tongue, but must take it in one of the 11 languages of the 15 ‘old’ Member States.

In a small country like Cyprus, the human loss has been devastating and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all my colleagues for the condolences offered to the families of the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">While an investigation into the exact cause of the crash is under way, it would appear from leaked official reports that long-standing organisational errors and administrative shortcomings may have rendered the Cyprus Civil Aviation Department incapable of fulfilling adequately its role as an aviation safety service.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Government of Cyprus has committed itself to corrective measures immediately, it is now clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation for some time and has kept largely quiet and chosen to follow a slow and rather ineffective course of remedial action. Civil aviation authorities in other Member States may have similar safety-related problems, and corrective measures may be needed urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that when the Commission makes a statement in this House later on tonight, it will be persuasively clear of its intention to tighten up urgently its watchdog role over the civil aviation authorities and to make sure that transparency is strictly applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like now to address the floods affecting central Europe. Several tens of thousands of people have been affected by the rivers bursting their banks and the huge volume of rainfall in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. The situation is without doubt worst in Romania: following the spring floods, it has suffered catastrophic damage in July and August. The floods, covering 34 counties and claiming many lives, have left 575 settlements, homes, several hundred kilometres of motorway, 83 schools, 29 nursery schools, hospitals and churches under water. The financial cost of the damage caused as a result of the natural disasters affecting Romania amounts to EUR 1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Hungarian delegation, it is our moral duty to use every means at our disposal to support the region’s inhabitants. Romania – the poorest of the countries affected – cannot cover the enormous costs of reconstruction out of its own resources. It therefore needs to receive assistance as soon as possible from the European Union Solidarity Fund to be able to carry out salvage operations. I request your kind support in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The mood in many Member States today is quite different from last year. Particularly the French Government springs to mind, now that the deadline of 3 October is drawing nearer. The arrogance with which Ankara haughtily refused to make the slightest effort in the area of human rights – examples I would cite include the recognition of the Armenian genocide, and the recent scandalous charges brought against Mr Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish author, with regard to linguistic rights for the Kurdish minority –shows how Turkey and its culture remain incompatible with our European values.</p>

<p class="contents">Throughout the summer months we in Ireland have witnessed the direct impact of the importation of cheap Brazilian beef into the market. If you recall, Commissioner Fischler promised farmers less bureaucracy and better market prices. However, what we and farmers throughout Europe are seeing is that the price for their product will be set by the lowest-cost producer outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen what has happened with the textile industry throughout Europe. Are we going to see something similar happen to the European Union's agriculture and food industry?</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach the world trade talks again in November, I urge the Commission to ensure that beef is treated as a sensitive product and that we do not eradicate our own beef producers because of cheap third country imports. I would add that the regulations that Europe imposes on its farmers are very strict and much more difficult than those imposed on food produced outside the Union and that should be taken into account as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
