<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent wave of terrorist attacks even struck at the Union itself. This morning we observed a minute’s silence in memory of the young Italian servicemen who lost their lives, and also in memory of the Iraqi civilians who died. Clearly, no country or sector is risk-free.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise that whether we like it or not, acts of this kind can take place at any time and place, regardless of the motive behind them. The maritime sector is no exception. I would remind you of the case of the cruise liner <span class="italic">Achille Lauro</span>. Admittedly, that was back in 1985. Subsequently, however, the oil tanker <span class="italic">Limburg</span> suffered a terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal aims to facilitate effective and harmonised application of the security measures for ships and port facilities endorsed by Member States of the Union in the context of the International Maritime Organisation. The proposal is intended to establish a common area of maritime security in which the same level of safety is guaranteed for all maritime movements within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is in line with the text adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning security in the civil aviation sector. In both the maritime and the civil aviation sectors, determined action on security by the European Union is bound to prove to our international partners that we take the whole range of issues involved very seriously indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The instruments adopted within the International Maritime Organisation only apply to ships engaged in international trade and to facilities at the ports they use. It is desirable to extend some of the provisions of these instruments to domestic maritime traffic within Europe. This would help to attain the global objective of security for the maritime transport sector. It is therefore essential to ensure that the measures to be applied are in proportion to the possible risks. Priority should be given to passenger transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal goes further than some of the provisions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation. It renders mandatory certain provisions that were only classed as recommendations in the IMO agreement. The intention is to guarantee the maximum level of security envisaged and to prevent Member States from arriving at conflicting interpretations. To this end, there is provision for a single national focal point responsible for monitoring security measures for ships and port facilities. There is also provision for an inspection process overseen by the Commission. This will monitor the implementation of national plans adopted within the framework of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also adjusts certain provisions agreed within the framework of the IMO for the benefit of the domestic maritime traffic of Member States. It broadens the scope of application of IMO security measures for passenger ships on domestic routes taking them more than 20 nautical miles away from the coast. Application is extended to include all other passenger ships on domestic routes. Cargo ships will also be covered to a certain extent. There is also provision for adjustment procedures regarding ships providing scheduled services.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate once again that the IMO is determined that these security measures for maritime traffic shall come into force on 1 July 2004. The main aim of the draft regulation before the House is to ensure Member States of the Union adopt the necessary measures within the agreed time period. This will ensure Member States meet their international commitments. It will also ensure that application of these measures is harmonised across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for everything to be in place by the deadline set. Consequently, I cannot but endorse all action leading to adoption at the earliest possible opportunity without detriment to the content. I realise Parliament and the rapporteur are fully aware of this. Cooperation with the Council has been ongoing for several months now, with a view to ensuring the text is adopted at the earliest opportunity, preferably at first reading. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Miguelez Ramos for her excellent work. Thanks are also due to the whole House for its efforts to reach a swift, effective and efficient solution in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the European Commission dealt with the security of passengers on cruise liners in Europe some time ago, in the White Paper on transport. Parliament has also expressed its concerns on security and on the causes of fishing accidents. The House called for a high level of security for both passengers and crew. As the Commissioner stated, however, it was following the tragic events of 11 September that the International Maritime Organisation called for new measures. At its November meeting the IMO unanimously agreed that new measures should be drawn up for the security of ships and port facilities. Maritime transport of passengers or cargo is deemed to be one of the most vulnerable sectors at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">These new international instruments will come into force automatically for all Member States on 1 July 2004. It is important to bear this in mind. The measures must therefore become part of Community legislation prior to that date, so that experience can be gained regarding their interpretation and harmonised application, and also concerning Community monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their understanding in responding to the urgency. I must thank them too for the flexibility they showed in dealing with this draft regulation. I also appreciate their support for this report. The latter was adopted unanimously, with one single abstention. I am particularly grateful for the work undertaken by those who served as draftsmen of the opinion. I refer to Mr Oreja Arburua and Mr Folias. I am indebted to them both for their considerable help and support.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this suggests the European Parliament endorses such a global approach. It also suggests the House believes that problems affecting the whole planet are best dealt with by means of measures proposed by international organisations. This should prove more effective than the adoption of unilateral measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures adopted by the IMO only apply to international maritime transport. Nonetheless, the cross-border sector is not the only one under threat. The RETT Committee welcomed the extension of these measures at European level, to cover domestic routes and the relevant port facilities. As a result, security standards within the Community will be higher than those provided for at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime security must be more than a response to the terrorist threat. It must also include appropriate preventive measures to counter threats of all kinds. That is why the draft regulation broadens the scope of mandatory measures to include not only passenger ships but also cargo ships such as those transporting containers, chemical substances, gases and crude oil. The port facilities used by these ships are also covered. </p>
<p class="contents">Maritime security has become an issue of grave concern for European citizens, following the serious maritime accidents in European waters in recent years. I have in mind the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and especially the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. The first anniversary of that disaster is currently being marked. As we speak, in another room in this building, the leader of the regional government in Asturias is presenting the conclusions of a report on this terrible accident in the hope of assisting us in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment of the SOLAS Convention and of Part A of the ISPS Code involves mandatory provisions. Part B of the aforementioned code consists of recommendations, but the Commission is proposing that some of these should become mandatory. The RETT Committee endorses this approach. The mandatory measures concern equipment on board and lay down a set of security measures. Other measures concern the theoretical and practical training of staff concerned, and lay down clearly the duties and responsibilities of the various actors.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation also provides for some of the recommendations in Part B of the ISPS Code to become mandatory. The aim is to increase the level of security and forestall differences of interpretation. The European Commission is to be responsible for verification of the effectiveness of the national plans of Member States and of the activities of the national authorities. The European Maritime Safety Agency will be charged with providing support for the execution of these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The RETT Committee paced itself to comply with the tight deadlines imposed by procedures in the House. The Vice-President of the Commission referred to this earlier. It is hoped that this range of measures will come into force in July 2004. Simultaneously, we have worked closely with the Council and the Commission with the aim of ensuring that this regulation is adopted at first reading as befits the urgency of the measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The RETT Committee deemed it necessary to draft a number of important comments to improve the proposal. One of these was mentioned earlier. It involves applying the measures to cargo ships as well as to passenger ships. Another concerned setting up a European coastguard service or body before 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of this committee urged the European Commission to table a directive on overall security of port facilities before the end of 2003. The directive should include accompanying security measures applicable in all Community ports. It should cover all the workers concerned. I have in mind seafarers, port workers and all professionals required to work in these areas at times. We believe it is essential for the seafarers to be guaranteed training, exercises and practical experience involving the staff responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we share the Commission’s concern regarding containers. We trust the work we have undertaken will facilitate an agreement between the institutions. It would then be possible for this regulation to be applied as from 1 July 2004. The European Parliament has done good work. That work can help improve the various aspects of security relevant to maritime transport. It responds to the citizens’ concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to make a technical comment with regard to Amendment16. The text endorsed by the RETT Committee and which appears as the new Article 3 paragraph 2, subparagraph 2a actually replaces subparagraph 2 of paragraph 2 of Article 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is no mere formality. The rapporteur has made it possible for the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to be largely incorporated into the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This meant that there was some purpose to our work in the LIBE Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs de Palacio endorsed the view expressed in the House previously. It was stated earlier that we are currently surrounded by terrorism and under constant threat from it. Consequently, measures designed to combat this scourge of the twenty-first century are now particularly important. I speak too as a citizen of the Basque country where terrorism is a daily event.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the International Diplomatic Conference of the contracting parties to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea is to be commended. It made it clear that any citizen and any form of transport could be attacked. They are all liable to become soft targets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to bear in mind that the Union is due to take in ten new Member States next year. As enlargement approaches it is imperative for us to strengthen all measures relevant to the fight against terrorism and to the protection of our vessels and ports. In this regard, the committee’s amendments aimed to provide a minor clarification to the Commission’s proposal. The amendments call for all unlawful acts to be covered. I have in mind terrorism, piracy and similar acts. They are especially threatening to the safety of vessels, their cargo, passengers and crew.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of recent environmental disasters, we have also endeavoured to strengthen security measures applicable to the transport of cargo containing dangerous substances. Illegal handling of such substances represents a particular hazard both for the environment and human beings. These substances must therefore be included in the scope of application of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that a focal monitoring centre for maritime security should be set up. Such a centre would be a point of contact between the Commission and Member States as regards monitoring the measures contained in this regulation. I also agree with the rapporteur on broadening the scope of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to allow it to fulfil its task of inspection and following up the present regulation. This is probably best achieved through a new legislative instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for this regulation and the Commission’s communication to come into force at the earliest opportunity. The regulation ought to be in place on 1 July 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And of course I understand the rush on this issue. However, I must register a complaint about the fact that a proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for cofinancing the cost of these measures was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">An OECD study in July 2003 calculated the initial cost of the measures needed at USD 1 279 million in initial investments, followed by USD 730 million a year to maintain them. As you will understand, this massive cost, which will be divided between the European ports, will need to be paid, as there is no cofinancing as proposed by the Committee on Industry, by the ports, shipping companies and small and medium-sized companies engaged in fringe activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore understand that the competitiveness of the European economy will bear a disproportionately heavy burden in comparison with other competing economies. The fact that it is certain that jobs will be lost and small and medium-sized companies will close has also been ignored. I worry that none of this has been taken into proper account and I worry that we are sacrificing this in our hurry to pass the regulation. I hope that time will prove me wrong, but I am very worried that these serious issues will cost the European economy a great deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that the rules drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation should actually be mandatory. We had lengthy discussions about whether this was even permissible, as shipping is a global business. No, though, we have to transpose the most important points into Community law, that being the only way in which we can really ensure that the IMO rules are promptly applied across the board in EU waters and in European ports, thus protecting the public from the potential dangers arising from terrorism, piracy or other illegal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, of course, regret having to discuss these issues with relative speed. Along with the problem with financial sustainability, which Mr Folias has just addressed, people in the ports are constantly asking whether what we are prescribing is workable, and whether it can be implemented in practice. I hope that the Council will work very carefully through the results in practice when these regulations are transposed, but, as the IMO rules are to apply from 1 July next year, we believe it to be important that we should now create legal certainty, and so we endorse the rapporteur’s request that agreement be reached at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope, however, that the rules devised jointly by the rapporteur and the Council will indeed result in workable and practical regulations in ports, as these are crucial nodal points which we want to make safer without hindering them from functioning. They must function, and I hope that we can achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was, of course, the loss of the <span class="italic">Erika </span>on 12 November 1999 and even the attack on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, with implications for the maritime risk. There was also the loss of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, the anniversary of which falls tomorrow, 19 November 2002. These events will certainly lead us to provide ourselves with regulations ranging from prevention to sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of our colleague, which I support, leads me to emphasise three points. The first is that the freedom of the seas must be controlled. The sea can no longer be seen as an arena for individual adventure, for it also presents a risk to other people. More careful monitoring and greater discipline are necessary, from the open sea to the port facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU must put down firmer roots within the IMO, which is something of a maritime ministry for the whole world, just as, for example, the IMF plays the role of a Ministry of Finance. Among the forty or so members who, I believe, form the management board, a dozen are members of the current or future EU. It would therefore be worth coordinating them better. Otherwise, it will be that much easier to have recourse to flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, any law must be able to give rise to sanctions. Otherwise, it is sterile and ineffective. The IMO conventions are not in any way binding. I think that action must be taken to ensure that they become so one day and, moreover, efforts must in the same way be made to ensure that the ship’s country of origin takes responsibility for it. As long as that is not done, there will still be gaps in our arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise: controlled freedom on the seas, organised unity in the IMO and legality respected by all. These are three principles that must again be worked on. They mark out the path of maritime security and safety, but the path is still a long one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The task of politicians and policy-makers in the field of security measures, in this case in ports and on ships, consists in striking the difficult balance between workability and the desired effect of the intended measures. This is a thankless task from the outset, for the port authorities and shipping companies that are required to apply the new regulations will always experience these as a nuisance. For the legislator, the question does remain whether security in the maritime sector will actually increase as a result of this. So far, this sector has enjoyed a sound reputation where security is concerned. If this were to remain so thanks to this package of legislation, the question is whether we in Europe will receive credit for it. To wait and see is not an option. This is why it is particularly important for this package to be applied promptly, but not at the expense of everything else. I find it strange that we in Europe are going further than what we agreed in the framework of the IMO, especially by also wanting to apply the measures to our local shipping. It is worth noting that America, which forced this package through in the context of IMO, does not do this itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is Europe aiming so high? An administrative burden on our local shipping will lead to goods being transported through Europe with more difficulty. This particularly affects the small ports, with only a few hundred thousand euros in turnover. More obstacles in the transport of goods means that the transport sector, as a rule, will incur additional costs. Additional costs are inefficient, and inefficiency means that the Lisbon objectives are certainly not moving any closer.</p>
<p class="contents">At that rate, we will never be competitive at an international level. Meanwhile, ships sail up and down the east and west coast of America, carrying goods, without encountering any port authorities or customs officials. In Europe, this will be a different story anyhow, as our internal market does not, unfortunately, apply to our coastal strip. Local shipping between the Netherlands and Belgium does not exist. This is still considered international, but will thus from now on also fall within the internal market. The internal maritime borders should therefore be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that, in general, I will be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I will withdraw my Amendment 42 because Amendment 65, tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, is preferable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also reiterate that I am in favour of the broadest interpretation of the concept of maritime security. Consequently, I welcome the fact that the regulation before us today does contain the preventive measures required to deal with potential risks of all kinds. Such measures should not apply only to passenger vessels. Ships transporting containers, chemical products, gases, oils or other hazardous cargoes must also be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now the first anniversary of the tragic incident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. That tanker ended up at the bottom of the sea, having caused the worst maritime pollution and environmental damage on record. Further, the thousands of individuals who demonstrated yet again last Sunday in Galicia believe that the scale of the damage was so great because those responsible at government level in Spain grossly mismanaged the crisis that arose on the vessel on 13 November.</p>
<p class="contents">This all confirms the urgent need to put in place security plans to ensure future crises can be dealt with a minimum guarantee of success. It is also important to monitor application of the security measures and train teams through practical experience and simulations involving staff responsible for the safety of ships, ports and both international and domestic maritime transport.</p>

Firstly, it seems to me that we are being called this afternoon to engage in a genuinely schizophrenic exercise. With the Miguélez Ramos report, we are invited to transpose two instruments adopted at world level by the IMO, aimed at just the right time at reinforcing the safety of port installations in the framework of the fight against international terrorism. With the Jarzembowski report, however, we are invited to adopt, at European level, a directive on market access to port services which, by applying the excellent principle of free competition in a very dogmatic way, is, on the contrary, in danger of undermining the safety of our ports and transforming those that are not so already into veritable ports of convenience. Is it to conceal this contradiction that the two documents are not the subjects of a joint debate?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have proof that the IMO – which, when spurred on by determined states, is obviously the relevant level for handling matters of international maritime security – is not condemned to weakness. The changes made to the SOLAS Convention and to the ISPS Code at the initiative of the United States prove this, as does the raising of the Fipol ceiling, agreed to at the initiative of several European states. There must therefore be no let-up in the pressure for responsible maritime transport, notably by creating a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area in the Atlantic and the Channel, as proposed by six European states.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, the Commission is taking advantage of what ought only to have been a transposition into Community legislation of arrangements relating exclusively to international shipping to broaden the scope of a number of provisions to include national maritime traffic. It is not certain that this wayward trend, while very obviously increasing the Commission’s supervisory powers, would make an effective contribution to increasing maritime public safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That requires laws and measures as a protective shield for their interests. The objective is to increase their excessive profits by abolishing seamen's fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, with terrorism as the pretext, an effort is being made to impose a regime of spying and policing in ports and on ships, with an extensive network of monitoring and repression, in the aim of striking policy and trade union action and trampling the grass-roots movement underfoot, in the face of the reactions provoked by the promotion of privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why nothing is said about the real problems and the real threats to maritime security, in other words the health and safety of those working on ships and in ports, the age of the fleet and the 'cut-throat' ports or ports of convenience preached by the privatisation directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Not a word about the responsibilities of big shipowners, who are accessories to the tragic maritime crimes which make them pioneering terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Not a reference to the fact that regional decisions about the safety of ships essentially weaken the role of the International Maritime Organisation and undermine the safety rules within the framework of an economic war and race for profit.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a wretched transaction between capitalists at the expense of the safety of life at sea and the marine environment, in the aim of increasing their excessive profits. The unaccountability of the shipping business is being strengthened through flags of convenience, the privatisation of shipping registers and the lack of any substantial inspections or controls by state authorities. These are the real and major terrorist threats to shipping, not the ghost pirates the European Union is looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">A mass, dynamic, grass-roots movement needs to develop against these policies to grab public assets and impose a mediaeval working regime and slave wages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are doing, at Community level, is to adopt an agreement which all the Member States of the European Union voted for in the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is here today, and Parliament agrees with it, so that we can adopt these measures at Community level, wrap them up and put them into practice. What makes this directive different from other similar European initiatives is that here we are being proactive, we are acting before we have a fatal disaster, whereas – as you know – in the past we have acted at Community level after shipwrecks or natural or other disasters. In this sense, I think that this is an absolutely positive initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, are there no concerns? Are there no questions? There are. They have been voiced by Mr Folias and by Mr Jarzembowski. Indeed, the industry at European level is worried that it will bear the burden of the measures before us, measures which are necessary and which – no one is in any doubt – have to be taken. It may be an excessive burden or, in certain instances, it may distort competition, because fewer measures will be needed in some Member States and more in others and the industry may therefore bear an uneven burden.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, given that the Council was not ready to accept certain amendments which directly addressed the question of funding by the Member States themselves, we called on the European Commission – both because the measures are urgent and because the European Parliament could not persuade the Council to move to the conciliation procedure (and I am glad that the Council accepts that at least) – to adopt an amendment making provision for the European Commission to present a study precisely on competition and the extra costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commissioner, because the industry really is worried, to assure us today that the Commission will submit this study as quickly as possible and that it will cover the concerns of industry about the functioning of competition in ports from now on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My worry has been that small ships operating domestic services, such as ferries and coastal craft, should not have to be included in what is administratively very cumbersome security action.

<p class="contents">My other worry has to do with the increase in costs for small and medium-sized port facilities.

<p class="contents">Today, our debate concerns sea transport, and I will of course take the liberty of offering my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur. With regard to maritime transport security, passenger safety is of vital importance to us, but it is also important to take account of the transport of goods. A number of ships do indeed transport dangerous goods and, therefore, constitute perfect targets for terrorism. It has also been seen, even independently of any problem of terrorism, that simple natural disasters could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that contributes to better protection must, therefore, be welcomed and, once again, very important arrangements are being proposed to us, which I support: a national monitoring centre for security at sea and increased staff training, not forgetting the adequate equipping of ports – so many measures for which we have called many times in this House. That is what I think is important, even if I agree with my fellow MEPs in asking for these arrangements to be applied in a balanced and harmonious way, without compromising the actual activity of the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear definitions of each party’s responsibilities are also crucial, which is why I have to tackle the issue of the responsibility of the Member States. Are the latter prepared to make maritime security a major theme? Which are the countries that have so far transposed the directives voted on in this House? Which countries genuinely monitor the application of our European regulations? What point have we reached in preparing the European map of ports of refuge? Which states have progressed, and which are dragging their heels? I know that, where France is concerned, arrangements have finally been made along these lines. What is the position, and even the decision, of the Council on putting in place the European coastguards I have been requesting for a long time?</p>
<p class="contents">If another disaster or accident were to occur, would Europe still be incriminated, by having helped make it possible, or will the Member States finally face up to their responsibilities?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have in fact completed a piece of work – and a terrific job, at that – in close partnership with the European Parliament.

<p class="contents">As some of my fellow Members have said quite rightly during the debate on this regulation, in view of the existence of terrorism we are faced with a series of dangers. We have adopted measures in this Parliament. We have adopted measures on the initiative of the Commission, which, in an active way, has been presenting proposals to us during this legislature for improving security in all forms of transport. We have adopted them and we are on the point of adopting them in the field of maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of maritime transport we are concerned with international organised forms of terrorism, but there is also a form of terrorism which causes desolation internally, in cases such as Spain. This needs to be combated and measures need to be adopted, and that is what we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made, but improving our safety, improving traffic safety, improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on her proposals and the rapporteur on her determination and will for these measures to be applied quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore share the concerns over the issue of maritime transport expressed by the Commission and by the rapporteur and which are clearly implied in the proposal for a regulation we are now examining, which seeks to enhance ship and port facility security, as part of the war on terrorism. Such action would necessarily involve the implementation, throughout the European Community, of the international security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and consequently defining a common European policy in this field. This would entail stepping up levels of protection whilst at the same time ensuring that there are no differences of interpretation amongst the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to refer to three issues that I believe are crucial. First of all, with regard to extending the measures adopted under the IMO on domestic shipping and the relevant port facilities, I wish to highlight the need for setting a timetable that is sufficiently long to enable the countries concerned to comply with the rules laid down. The inclusion of national maritime traffic should furthermore take account of the assessment of the risk in relation to the level of danger facing the vessel and/or cargo, and in relation to the vulnerability of the vessel or port facility, set against a cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards implementation and monitoring compliance, which are covered by Article 10 of the proposal for a regulation, I believe that these tasks should be carried out by the competent authorities of each Member State. Because Community inspections are necessary, these must be undertaken solely under the regulation’s legal base and always in cooperation with the authorities of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to point out that, in accordance with the regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, this body has no power to act in the field of security as such. This aspect should be considered in a much-needed revision of this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The consequences of these accidents oblige us to speed up the adoption of maritime safety measures of all types and to seek consensus between the various political groups and between the institutions – Commission, Parliament and Council. We must therefore prevent long legislative procedures in order to respond to the citizens’ demands, reaching agreements at first reading preventing the need to go to the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commission on the proposal it has presented to us, and our rapporteur on her report, which has achieved unanimity, which is significant, as is the support we are giving to the amendments introduced in relation to the extension to other types of ship, such as those transporting particularly dangerous goods, to those preventive measures of all types, and to global agreements within the world framework of the IMO, as well as with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is therefore timely but, I would insist, we must remember that, if we agree on the fundamental issue, as we do in general terms, we must also agree on the form and the procedures, and act with the greatest diligence, as has been reiterated here. We must not waste a single second on political discussions which extend the legislative procedures on such sensitive issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The IMO measures within the framework of the SOLAS Agreement are therefore welcome, as will the MARPOL measures be, which not only enhance the safety of ships and ports but which also provide for the imposition of criminal sanctions, which we will have to wait to be debated and approved in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must be on the front line in this fight and I hope that the recently created temporary committee will continue with this consensus and provide the best possible resources and instruments in this fight and lead it on behalf of the European Union at world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal is especially necessary in order to clarify the new international instruments adopted last year by the International Maritime Organisation. The tragic events of 11 September showed that every production sector, mode of transport or building can easily fall prey to a terrorist attack. Preventive and protective action is also urgently needed for other threats to security at sea, such as piracy and sabotage. It is nevertheless important that the EU does not needlessly rush to adopt measures but instead calmly keeps to the framework of the timetable that has already been drawn up by the IMO, which, as it is, is very rigorous and demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s changing world I see international cooperation as being of priority importance in order to improve security for ships and port facilities and a far better alternative to the unilateral measures that were adopted earlier on. It is in the EU’s own interests to operate in multilateral systems, whilst reinforcing them at the same time. Furthermore, cooperation with Russia is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Commissioner Bolkestein’s concern regarding the possible negative effects on trade that unilateral security measures would have. There is a danger that the unilateral agreements in the container sector made in collaboration by American and some European ports will distort competition. In this regard I welcome the current negotiations between the Commission and the United States of America to cover the Container Security Initiative agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does not really differ in content from the IMO instruments that have been drawn up exclusively for international shipping. For that reason, I think it is questionable whether the same instruments should be interpreted in the EU to apply equally to domestic transport services in the Member States. Taking the costs and other difficulties resulting from compliance with security measures such as these into account, I see no need to go any further than the IMO conventions. The power of decision to apply measures to individual countries’ domestic transport systems must in any case remain with the Member States, which are best placed to assess the situation. It would, for example, be absurd if ferries operating in the internal waters of Finland, with its thousands of lakes, had to endure thorough security checks if there were no particular threats to security anyway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Oreja Arburúa and Mr Folias, from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, respectively, for the opinions they have contributed and which have also served to improve the text proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs’ work in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council will allow – I hope – this text to be approved at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many amendments, which are enormously technical, which are intended, if I have understood correctly, to bring the Commission’s proposal closer to the text resulting from the activities of the Council which for its part has held many meetings on this project, in the presence of experts. I am happy that, thanks to this interaction – a kind of almost permanent trialogue throughout the negotiation – we have been able to find a positive response to almost everything.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, in response to what has been raised by some of the honourable Members, specifically Mr Folias and Mr Hatzidakis, that we accept the amendment which calls for a study focused on the distribution of funding between public authorities and operators without prejudice to the distribution of competences between Member States and the European Community, a study in which the costs of the application of these measures will be analysed, as well as its repercussions on the competitiveness of the maritime sector in relation to alternative transport systems and the European economy in general. We will naturally present this study to Parliament and the Council and where necessary we will draw up the relevant proposals in accordance with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are five amendments which raise certain problems for the Commission and which I would like to comment on briefly. Two of them we cannot accept because they call into question the delicate balance we have achieved with the Council with regard to the extension of these measures to national traffic. I prefer those of your amendments which precisely reflect the balance which has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three new amendments relating to comitology, which, in so far as they do not jeopardise the role of the Maritime Safety Committee, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002, we will be able to accept. Finally, given the complexity of the tasks in hand, the Commission accepts removal of the early implementation of these measures, although I believe it to be essential that each State adopts a national programme for the application of the legislation we are proposing with this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission can accept 62 amendments in full, 5 partially, and rejects, as I have said, just 2. These figures clearly reflect the cooperation which has taken place, which I am glad about and in relation to which I would like to thank once again all the honourable Members for your work throughout these months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
