At no point during those negotiations, which were clearly not easy, did any country put their national interests before what some people describe as the reunification of Europe, however legitimate they may have been. This is demonstrated by the fact that the most difficult chapters of that negotiation were concluded during the Spanish Presidency of the Union, which until then had been the biggest net receiver of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been calculated that the enlargement has cost as much as EUR 200 000 million. During this debate the European Commission has been called upon to explain how it proposes to distribute this sum amongst the 15 old Member States. Because the confirmed information that we have had access to demonstrates that the European Commission's proposal in this regard is not fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not the case that it is proposed that Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece pay a sum that, compared to their GDP, is three times the Union average, is much greater than that proposed for all the net contributors and, for example, is four times the sum proposed for Germany? If that is the case, Commissioner, the European Commission has the responsibility to propose, within the negotiations on the renewal of the financial perspectives, a compensation mechanism for these countries to alleviate the effects of the sharp fall in their net income from the Union and thus to prevent any risk to their process of true convergence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, we should never lose sight of the fact that regional policy is the most publicly visible of all the EU’s policies, which means that it is our responsibility to press ahead with this policy in a sensible and sustainable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">A few moments ago Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to the costs this will involve. I would argue that the unavoidable costs of a round of enlargement of this kind must be shared in a reasonably fair manner. In order for this to happen, we need both to show solidarity with the regions, which no longer play as large a part in structural and cohesion policy as they have done in recent years, and to avoid making excessive demands of the EU Member States commonly known as net contributors. I need to be able to explain to my fellow countrymen why the money that Germany contributes to the EU is a good investment. At the same time as enlisting support at home, however, I also need to ensure that the EU appreciates that the situation is a great deal more complex than it may have been ten years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, therefore, the proposals issued by the Commission, relating to a correction mechanism under which the burden on net contributors would be eased somewhat, are extremely significant. I believe that more serious thought should be given in future to a reorganisation of the own resources system and to a move away from current costs and procedures, and this applies to the Council of Ministers as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that consideration should be given to the use of cofinancing for agriculture measures, in order to ensure that changes are made to procedures in this field as well. The first steps have in fact been taken in this direction in the Financial Perspective and in the Böge report. At the same time, however, I would note that it is the responsibility of this House to manage money as efficiently as possible, and to pay close attention to what this money is spent on. The n+2 rule will play a key role in this respect, in particular in terms of accountability to net contributors and the responsible use of taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that today’s debate will help us to negotiate the Financial Perspective and formulate regional policy, and that we will stand together in showing solidarity to one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regional policy is a necessary and equitable instrument that offsets the adverse impact of the internal market on the least economically developed regions and countries. In light of the fact that the more prosperous Member States will derive substantial benefit from enlargement, while cohesion countries, such as Portugal and Greece will be most affected by the costs of enlargement at macroeconomic level, and in turn by the threat of a possible reduction in structural funds as part of budgetary restrictions and by the 'statistical effect', I should like to ask the Commission the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Does it not think that far greater financial resources are required than the amounts proposed for regional policy in its 2007-2013 financial framework to meet the needs of the enlargement and to guarantee effective cohesion policy? What measures does the Commission intend to take in support of the countries, such as Portugal and Greece, most affected by enlargement? Does it intend to set up specific programmes geared to helping them develop and modernise their economies in the context of an enlarged EU, as has happened previously? Is the Commission prepared to uphold the idea of full compensation for the 'statistical effect' or guarantee that regions affected by the 'statistical effect' receive the support they would have if eligibility were calculated on the basis of a 15-member EU, given that no region should feel disadvantaged by enlargement? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even though the importance of the impact of enlargement cannot be assessed only in budgetary terms, I understand the will expressed by Members to have a better understanding, for the sake of transparency and non-discrimination, of the Commission’s budgetary proposal in the context of enlargement. Enlargement has financial implications and we need a financial effort at EU level. However, let us be clear that the impact of enlargement also concerns other dimensions. I agree that the Union’s budget for the period 2007-2013 must be sufficient to guarantee the economic convergence of the 10, which I am convinced will be for the good of all 25 Member States. It is clear that the size of the overall budgetary envelope for 2007-2013, and the size of the envelope for cohesion policy in this context, matters a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Will we have sufficient funds for 2007-2013? We never have enough funds, because Europe’s needs are enormous. But in reality we know that we do not have all the money in the world; nor do we have the absorption capacities that would allow us to spend much more money in an efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress that, some months ago, the Commission tabled a proposal under which every euro is well thought through and justified. That is why we consider the proposal to be well balanced and well prepared, including with regard to cohesion policy, and a basis for addressing the needs, problems and challenges that the enlarged Europe with a hundred million more citizens will face now and in the future. That is my reaction to your comment on whether we have enough money. I very much agree with Mrs Krehl’s comments on the efficient use of public and taxpayers’ money. We also have to think about the budget in terms of the efficiency and quality of its spending.</p>
<p class="contents">When we think about the cost of enlargement, I always feel tempted to remind you that the ten new Member States have fully contributed to the Union’s budget, including to the existing correction mechanism, in line with common rules. When you look at the policies that the new Member States are gradually introducing into major Union policies, we must remember that enlargement has already been taken into consideration from the point of view of the contribution to the financing of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">When preparing the proposal for 2007-2013, the Commission took into account all the budgetary developments linked to enlargement. In reply to your question of whether the Commission proposal constitutes equal treatment of the Member States in the context of cohesion policy, I should like to briefly mention the six basic principles on which we based our approach to the distribution of the costs and of the potential benefits when preparing the budget. These principles allow a fair distribution of the effects of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission has sought to guarantee the necessary means to finance economic convergence and cohesion in an enlarged, more diversified Europe. Secondly, the Commission has taken account of the economic fact of life that there are regions in the 15 Member States that have not yet completed the process of economic convergence. Thirdly, we strongly believe that a cohesion policy is also necessary for regions not subject to the convergence objective, whilst being guided by objective economic criteria and the ‘Berlin method’, as adjusted by the Commission. We also keep in mind the requirement that all Member States should be treated equitably in any final agreement. Fifthly, we believe that the cohesion policy should apply in a uniform way to all 25 Member States: we should not have one policy for the 10 Member States and another policy for the 15. Sixthly, the Commission remains aware that, for some Member States, difficulties will still need to be addressed in any final agreement in the course of the negotiations, again in the interests of overall fairness.</p>
<p class="contents">We follow very closely, and, as you know, participate as much as the role of the Commission allows, in the negotiation process between Member States. We are prepared to contribute in an appropriate way and whenever necessary to any final agreement taking into account specific cases. At this stage, the Commission will not propose any special solution or compensation mechanism. However, if, in the course of the negotiations in the Council, such a mechanism or such programmes and projects were proposed, then the Commission would be more than willing to participate in contributing to the final design of such a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important and true that the distribution of financial resources amongst Member States reflects in principle and in general the relative social and economic situation of each region and Member State, and they are measured by well-known indicators. I do not want to list them, but let me stress that the Commission has recognised that in certain cases final allocations will be affected by factors other than objective socio-economic circumstances in regions or Member States. As you know, according to recent statistics, 16 out of 254 regions with more than 60 million inhabitants will feel the statistical effect of enlargement. In these cases, the Commission has proposed an ad-hoc solution, namely creating a specific transitional scheme at regional level and adjusting certain parameters of the ‘Berlin method’. As a result, the Commission’s proposal for the statistical-phasing out regions represents a very limited reduction: an average of only 6% of what these regions would have received were they fully eligible for the convergence objective in the 2007-2013 period</p>
<p class="contents">This is the Commission’s current proposal. My concern is to maintain this proposal. As we hear, there are many other ideas, including in the Member States. Many consider this proposal to be too generous. We are, therefore, focusing very much on defending this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adjustment of the ‘Berlin method’, another instrument the Commission has used in its aim to share out fairly the effects of enlargement, we have also managed to increase the overall financial envelope by EUR 16 billion. This adjustment reflects the statistical effect of enlargement on the way we take into account the national prosperity factor in our calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that some of the reductions in the allocations, which are perceived by regions to be a consequence of enlargement, are not a result of enlargement, because there are 12 regions with 18 million people whose GDP has increased over the years faster than the Community average. Today, those regions will come under Objective 2. As a result, we have on the table today a budget that is more or less equally divided between the old and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">All the above elements confirm that the Commission’s proposal addresses the question of an equitable distribution of the effects of the enlargement at the same time –which is important for us – as preserving the objective nature of the method of allocation based on Community-level statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also react to what you, and in particular Mrs Krehl, said with regard to the balances on own-resources. Those issues clearly come under the responsibility of Dalia Grybauskaitė. I know that she would be delighted to exchange views with you on this. However, it must be said that although budgetary balances do not provide a complete picture of all the advantages stemming from Union membership, the Commission is aware that discussions on this subject are a reality and play an important role in the public debates in some of the Member States. That is why the Commission’s proposal on the system for financing the EU budget in terms of revenue, which is not my responsibility, should also be seen as a compromise solution, which is intended as a kind of safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">You have stressed the importance of net balances and you suggest a link between the regional policy and the allocation of funds and the net balances. To put this bluntly, this is not the best approach to regional policy, because we pursue regional policy in order to reduce disparities in accordance with Article 158 and not to solve the net balance questions. That is why we should not mix these discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is an error on the part of the Conference of Presidents, which has given the question the wrong title. Nonetheless, I shall overlook this matter in order to say that the basic message that the question wanted to send out is that burdens which arise in general in the new period of the financial perspectives should be distributed fairly between the Member States. I would say that not only the cohesion countries to date should be victims, but also the new Member States, which will need to be dealt with fairly, and I am not sure that this is always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, I should like to make three brief comments on the matter. First, there are certainly significant reductions as regards the cohesion countries in relation to their income from the European Union's regional policy and I welcome, within this framework, the Commissioner's hint, even if it was only a hint, that the Commission is willing at least to discuss some sort of compensation mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is to my mind scandalous that we should still have this British exemption in the budget, which is why I believe that there should also be a global debate at some point on the own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and lastly, I think that it is clear from the debate so far that Parliament needs to hold a broader debate in the immediate future, so that the papers going round the Commission corridors on the issues touched on by the question can be debated more broadly and so that we all know what the issues are and can establish the injustices against the cohesion countries and the regions of the European Union which are lagging behind from the development point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the 15 old Member States were in a position to deal with the enlargement. Nevertheless, as previous speakers have mentioned, it is the case that the countries that largely paid for this enlargement are going to lose the contributions from the Cohesion Fund as a result of the statistical effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Commissioner, Mrs Hübne, has said that, in the negotiations with the Council, she will try to create some compensation instrument or gradual phasing out, as we have seen with the regional funds. Because, in the case of Spain for example, this loss of Cohesion Fund is particularly dramatic, since there will be a sudden drop in its net operative income equivalent to 0.91% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Commission proposal, and this is what our question expresses, the signatories — including myself — express their concern at the unfair distribution of the financial cost of enlargement; the concern that the principle contained in the recent conclusions of the European Council, which urges fairness in funding, is being violated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Article is the EU’s life insurance policy. It endeavours to guarantee that all regions benefit, that the ‘win-win’ principle is established. It justifies the very existence of the entire EU. Should certain regions or population groups repeatedly find that they are excluded from general development, the consequence would be disintegration of unity in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">When the last ten new Member States joined the European Union, its population grew by over 20%, but GNP increased by only 5%. For historical reasons, the GNP per capita in all new Member States was somewhat clearly below the EU average. That is why the regional and structural policies of the EU must be targeted at the new Member States, and for that reason all new Member States are initially net gainers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the financial perspective and in the plans of the Commission, a significant amount of investment has been allocated to the new Member States, and after a few years they would jointly receive more regional and structural policy funding than the old Member States. This trend must be considered absolutely the correct one.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the danger, however, that the weakest regions in the EU will lose out on regional and structural policy measures. In absolute terms, nevertheless, they will not have become more prosperous or developed in any measure, even though regions even weaker than they have joined the Union. There is a risk, therefore, that the weakest regions in the EU will have to pay more for enlargement than the wealthiest regions, because their contribution to the EU budget is in relation to their GNP, and, in addition to that, they are losing funding they have received from it. This would seem to apply to the EU’s sparsely populated northern regions in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is that I am in favour of solidarity between the regions, something reflected in a great many aspects of the proposal. Regional policy also provides for solidarity between the regions, yet in my opinion, and in that of our group, the Cohesion Fund is not the best source of funding for solidarity-related measures, in that it lacks a programme-based approach. It would be far preferable to use the Structural Funds for this purpose, as this would facilitate more targeted responses to the problems experienced by the regions, as well as higher quality implementation and an efficient use of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has incorporated a great many of the criticisms Parliament made of the Cohesion Fund into the new proposal. I therefore believe that this is a well-balanced proposal, and, even though I come from a Member State that is a net contributor, I can endorse it. In my opinion, excessive demands would be counterproductive in this instance, as they do not bring about the desired results; instead, they lead to blockages of the kind we are currently experiencing. We want this Financial Perspective to be adopted as quickly as possible, yet the House is having to join with the Commission in fighting against the net contributors that are in favour of a 1% budget. In my opinion, adopting such an approach at present is counterproductive in the extreme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam President, enlargement constitutes a historic opportunity for the EU and, therefore, sufficient means must be provided to cope with the cost of an enlarged EU and for providing economic and social cohesion.

<p class="contents">The motivation for and the intention of the Structural Funds and the EU’s regional policy was to assist regions and countries in overcoming disparities and in developing their social and economic potential. Could the Commissioner confirm if this motivation will continue to inform the EU’s regional policy in the future? Does she regard the means to be sufficient to cope with it? There are 68 million people across the EU who continue to live in poverty, according to the European Anti-Poverty Network. This remains a huge challenge for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures that do not qualify for funding under the ERDF include the adapting, converting or renovating of buildings for housing purposes, even though expenditure on such measures is a heavy burden on the budgets of the new Member States. Available figures show that over one third of the citizens of these countries live in high-rise buildings, which were the most widespread form of housing in the former Communist states, yet the condition of these blocks is deteriorating sharply. The standard of living of the people living in these buildings is dropping because there is no money to modernise them, and the buildings are also energy-inefficient and bad for the environment. The EU ministers with responsibility for building-related matters who met in Prague in March 2005 asked the European Commission whether funding could be made available in order to provide at least a partial solution to this problem. I should therefore like to ask how the Commission intends to approach this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a great many challenges currently facing the European Union, which include global competition, an ageing society and the development of a knowledge-based economy. Yet there can be no question that one of the most important is the widening development gap between European regions, and even within these regions. This problem is due not only to the fact that new and relatively poor Central and Eastern European countries have joined the EU, giving rise to a sudden increase in disparities. The gap between different regions has been widening for many years, and this also holds true for the old Member States. The aim of the EU’s cohesion policy is to prevent such disparities, yet we should not forget that cohesion policy also implements key political goals, as well as having a sound economic base. European integration is founded on the principle of solidarity, and the most important aspect of solidarity is the desire for cohesion. European solidarity is the basis of European integration, and without it Europe would be nothing but a customs union. Cohesion policy should therefore be the main priority of the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, and funding should be targeted at the poorest regions and countries, as the primary function of cohesion policy must be to close development gaps between regions.</p>
<p class="contents">An appropriate level of funding must be guaranteed in order to implement development goals effectively. The new Financial Perspective must respond to the changes that have occurred, and it must make allowance for the fact that the European Union’s population increased one year ago by over 70 million inhabitants of less-developed regions. At the same time, regulatory changes must be made before any proposals to limit the EU’s budget are adopted. A simple rule should be applied in this instance, namely that a smaller budget means less state interference in the economy and completion of the common market. To my surprise, however, some of the Member States calling for a reduction in the minimum expenditure threshold, for example France and Germany, are also opposing the establishment of a genuine common market in services, as set out in the draft services directive, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is needed is vision, leadership and community spirit so that we can best meet the needs and address the consequences of the enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges of completing the internal market and European economic and monetary union were met with just such a firm response, when funding for the Structural Funds was doubled. If we are to meet the challenge of a viable enlarged Europe, regional development policy must once again take centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the policy of economic and social cohesion be strengthened and reinvigorated, in order to combat the enormous regional imbalances following the accession of many poorer regions of the new Member States, and to continue to address the problem that various regions in the old Member States still lag behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter aspect cannot be underestimated, particularly given that the regional imbalances might increase in the old EU of 15 Member States as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement. This is especially true of relations between outlying and central regions; in other words, while countries such as Portugal and Spain became more peripheral, and the central countries gained extra centrality. In fact, it is estimated that, as far as the EU of the 15 is concerned, the wealthier, more central countries have benefited most from the enlargement, and countries such as Portugal, Spain and Greece are probably those that have benefited least, or have in fact lost out.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore return to the issues raised in the oral question, as I do not feel that the Commission has provided adequate responses. Has the Commission calculated the cost-benefit ratio for each EU Member State? If so, does the Commission not think that ways should be found of compensating countries in which the costs clearly exceed the benefits? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The evidence shows that the cost of enlargement is not being divided fairly and proportionately between all the Member States. Countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are suffering serious repercussions, which may take on dramatic proportions if the final agreement on the new financial perspectives digresses from the European Commission's original proposals. I think that this is also the crucial issue for Commissioner Hübner, as she herself said. However, in the final analysis, the issue will be judged primarily on the final amount of the Community budget and the extent to which it will be able to adequately finance the Structural Funds and, subsequently, on how we will manage to ensure that there will be satisfactory financing to facilitate the continuation of development in the regions suffering the real repercussions of enlargement.</p>

I should like to ask Mrs Hübner if she could shed some light on rumours that discussions are taking place within the Council to interpret the Commission’s proposals on statistical effect to cover areas of Germany and Greece, but to exclude areas such as the Highlands, Islands and the south of Scotland?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a crying shame that the government of the United Kingdom cannot be anywhere near as constructive as the Commission proposals. The current UK Government is more intent on stabbing the Highlands, Islands and the south of Scotland in the back rather than fighting their corner. The Scottish Government has been notable only by its absence.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles of solidarity and cohesion across all 25 Member States of the European Union state that no region should be discriminated against. I would ask the Commission and the Council to reassure me that, despite the best efforts of the United Kingdom Government, no Scottish region will be discriminated against, and that the principles of statistical effect will apply as proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cost of enlargement also needs to be divided fairly, which means that the cohesion countries and regions must not be treated unfairly and the scandal of the British exemption must be ended at long last. We are calling for strong financial compensation mechanisms from the Commission, which must also work on this idea, strong support during the transitional period of the convergence regions and for the problem of the regions which fall victim to the so-called statistical effect to be properly addressed at long last. Anyway, the financial cost is small. Finally, as the objective of cohesion also aims for territorial cohesion, I think that areas at a geographical disadvantage need special care and treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Money is of course the main issue at stake with regard to regional policy, but other key issues include setting political objectives and reducing disparities within individual EU regions, with the latter having acquired particular significance since enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we should be asking is whether we want a coherent EU that is capable of developing more rapidly, or an EU where the differences are more pronounced and where the economic and political integration of the poorer regions proceeds at an even slower rate. Putting it bluntly, unless more money is earmarked for the Structural Funds following enlargement, the new Member States will always be tempted to block decisions to drive integration forward.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it another way, the amount of funding allocated to the EU’s structural policy must allow adequate support to be provided, both now and in the future, to less developed regions that have particular social and economic problems, whether such regions are situated in the current EU or in new Member States. As I have already said, this means that funding must be distributed fairly and channelled towards solving the most serious problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Although on the whole we agree with the Commission’s proposals for distributing funds between the various objectives, they can of course apply only if the total amount of funding is on the scale proposed by the Commission. If funds were to be distributed in this way and cuts made to total funding, as proposed by certain Member States, this would have an extremely harmful impact on the priority convergence regions in the old EU Member States. This is something we could not and will not stand for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even at that time, the principle of solidarity existed and was a key aspect that set our worldview apart. The objective has always been to ensure that no region is ever left behind in the name of a simplistic and fatalistic vision.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason, all Member States and regions have always been committed to developing and to making their development models sustainable. Today we all want more and there are more of us. Is it either reasonable or rational to expect that, following so much effort towards European cohesion, we are going to be wealthier because there are more of us? As European citizens we do not want only to look at the cosmetic appearance; we want to look at the substance and the structure, and this means not abandoning all of those regions which have yet to complete the process of real convergence and which, due to a simplistic financial outlook, seem to want to become rich overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also bear in mind that regional policy and the Lisbon Strategy must overlap; it is crucial that strong links be established between these two objectives if they are to be effective. Measuring growth in purely financial terms is both artificial and unsustainable; on the other side of that coin, sustainable development implies convergence and competitiveness. If we place emphasis on competitiveness, leaving behind those who have only recently started to stand on their own two feet, those countries will fall back down and will not have the strength to get up again alone. For us, for all of the citizens of this Europe of solidarity, competitiveness must not replace convergence. Nor must competitiveness replace a more visible regional policy. What is needed is solidarity with many regions such as the Algarve, the Highlands, the Asturias region and Madeira, and many other European regions that in theory became rich overnight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes as no surprise to us that Members from the old EU Member States have asked for a country-by-country analysis of the financial consequences of the last enlargement, and we are aware that these questions are also an indication of the fact that people expect the Commission to monitor and assess the consequences of any future enlargements. I am very much in favour of questions of this kind being asked, yet at the same time I should like to alert this House to the need to consider not only the costs and liabilities that show up on the balance sheet, but also the benefits derived by the old EU Member States. These benefits include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, a growth in trade, in capital investment and in the market for large-scale procurement, as well as greater environmental protection, and it is quite likely that some countries have derived more benefits than others. Rigorous financial analysis is indispensable, but we must not encourage those who see the European Union merely in terms of costs and liabilities. It should also be seen in terms of the benefits it provides on the basis of fairly distributed costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the concern of my colleagues, as expressed in the question presented to the Commission. In order to meet the legitimate expectations of the citizens of the European Union, regional policy must be based on the interests of the European Union as a whole, and on a fair distribution of responsibilities, and I am grateful for Madam Commissioner’s confirmation that the ten new Member States have also made their contribution in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution of the European Union provides for the strengthening of solidarity within the regions. Therefore it is important to maintain a balance, not only in the provision of funding to new and old members, but also in the funding of different regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean region, for instance, has for years received very extensive financial support, which is good and justified. However, it is not good that funding for the Nordic Dimension has been many times more modest, despite the fact that the Baltic Sea region is becoming the area with the greatest growth potential in the EU. The European Union has a Mediterranean strategy, in the same way that it has a Russia strategy. I would like to propose that the Commission should develop a separate strategy for the Baltic Sea region, and that this should be financed similarly to the Mediterranean strategy. This would provide a new balance in regional policy, because the Baltic Sea is becoming the Mediterranean of Northern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One practical question concerning regional development – the eligibility of value added tax from the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Fund. In the Estonian context, leaving value added tax off the list of eligible expenditures significantly reduces the ability of small local governments to submit projects. This means that structural assistance will become 18% more expensive for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal is now with the Council. The Commission is not, at this stage, able to put any proposal on the table. If, during the negotiation process in the Council, there is a possibility of creating a mechanism for funds of a specific nature then the Commission will certainly contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">On the important issue of housing, we cannot – and I believe we will not be able to – finance construction. However we will be able to contribute to many aspects of the renovation and reconstruction of housing in new and old Member States that have needs of this kind. I will elaborate on this on 21 April, or privately with Mr Piotrowski so as not to detain you here.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistical effect will apply to the Highlands and Islands so it is OK. Still with regard to statistical effect, there is not strong support in the Council for the generosity we have proposed, which is also being criticised as being insufficiently generous! In the Council there are ideas of making it less generous. The question remains open.</p>
