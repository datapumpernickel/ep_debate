<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is right to be taking an interest in mountain regions. As you know, the Commission is also paying great attention to these issues, as demonstrated by the conference organised in October at the initiative of my colleagues Michel Barnier and Franz Fischler on the subject of ‘Community policies and the mountains’. My colleagues Mrs Wallström and Mr Barnier – the latter of whom is in Brussels at a meeting of the Presidium of the Convention – have asked me to update you on some of the work being undertaken and on some issues still outstanding as regards the Commission's work on the European Union's mountain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Treaty does not refer to the concept of mountain regions as such. Article 158, which provides the legal basis here, states, in connection with the policy of economic and social cohesion, that the Community shall aim in particular to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas. It could be argued that specifically incorporating the concept of mountain regions into the Treaty would better reflect stakeholders' concerns. For example, 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2 of Europe's structural policy. Compensatory payments for less favoured regions made under the common agricultural policy also benefit mountain regions in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has commissioned a study in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of mountain regions more effectively. This study has three objectives: to define the mountain regions of the enlarged EU, to create a database of these regions and to carry out an objective analysis of the situation in mountain regions and of existing Community and national policies, and to evaluate those policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the first of these objectives, a definition of mountain regions is to be created for the 27 current Member States or candidate countries covered by the study. This definition is being drawn up on the basis of topographical criteria, and in some cases climatic criteria are also taken into consideration. At the beginning of December 2002, the contractor carrying out the study presented the Commission with 16 possible definitions, and these are at present being examined in detail. A decision will be taken at the end of December as to which definition can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this process of defining regions, a start can now be made on collecting statistical data. We expect that the process of collecting and analysing data and the presentation of the final report will be completed by September 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards regional policy and the common agricultural policy taking account of mountain regions in future, I have already explained that regional policy and agricultural and rural development policy are indeed two policies that directly take account of mountain regions. In the case of regional policy this is done through regional programmes for Objective 1 and Objective 2 areas, and also under the Community initiative known as Interreg, particularly through the Alpine region programme. Under the CAP, mountain regions are chiefly supported by means of compensatory payments for less favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration is at present being given to the future of these policies. The Commission's proposals on the future of the regional policy are to be presented at the end of 2003 as part of the Third Cohesion Report. It would therefore be premature to prescribe at this early stage how mountain regions are to be taken into account in the forthcoming 2007-2013 planning period for regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, the Commission's proposal places particular emphasis on strengthening agri-environmental measures, which often benefit mountain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards measures in favour of mountain regions under other Community policies, I would like to say a little more about competition policy and about general interest services. As you know, EU policy on grants of state aid is based on Article 87(1) of the Treaty, which stipulates that grants of aid by the state are fundamentally incompatible with the common market. However, this article also specifies cases in which grants of state aid may be approved. These exceptions include aid of a regional nature, or to be precise aid ‘to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment’, in other words areas whose per capita gross national product is less than 75% of the Community average. Certain other areas may also be covered by this exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission attaches great importance to services of general interest, as demonstrated by its communication of January 2001. However, as you know, maintaining and developing services of general interest is solely a matter for the individual Member States. The Commission can only offer encouragement in this field. In its communication, the Commission states that the aim of services of general interest is to ensure universal basic provision, that is to say access to essential services, including those in remote or inaccessible areas. In addition, the new Article 16 of this Treaty specifically recognises the important role played by services of general economic interest in promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion. The importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I would like to mention is the Alpine Convention. Although this convention only directly affects four Member States, the Commission was involved in launching this initiative. It was not until summer 2002 that a sufficient number of signatories to the convention had ratified the various protocols so that it could come into operation. For its part, the Commission is investigating the various options available to it for more active involvement in the context of the Convention. The Commission has already presented its proposal for signing the transport protocol to the Council. However, I have to report that this proposal has so far not made much further progress within the Council. Furthermore, it needs to be made very clear that these protocols also have to be supported by the Member States at Council level, as the Council is responsible for signing and ratifying them on behalf of the Community. As you know, several states participating in the Alpine Convention have not yet ratified the protocols. However, we hope that things will move forward positively in the coming months, reflecting the effort made by some Member States at the end of the summer to breath new life into the Alpine Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will continue to pay close attention to issues concerning mountain regions. Present and planned work, in particular the Directorate-General for Regional Policy's study, the results of the mid-term review of existing programmes and the conclusions of the Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion will give us a more accurate picture of the situation and options for further action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, unfortunately, mountain regions have rarely been a subject on which we have made observations or recommendations. And yet these regions warrant particular attention. Mountain areas offer a huge variety of riches. They are usually exceptional areas, which must therefore be managed in a very specific way, within a global policy of sustainable development of the mountains. These are complex areas due to their geography and their climate. They are areas in which farming plays a crucial role, but not any old farming; it must be a form of farming which is extensive, that takes care to preserve species of fauna and flora and the abundant supply of water, and to protect forests and natural habitats as defined by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of farming cannot exist, however, without people, hence the need to preserve these mountain areas from desertification and to do everything possible to maintain a human presence there. We must therefore strengthen and update provisions to benefit young farmers. The Commission has set up a number of programmes with which we are quite familiar: Leader and Interreg, inter alia, as you mentioned, Commissioner. This aid probably needs to be simplified, precisely because these are areas with specific characteristics, in order to make them more flexible to ensure that they are better suited to the terrain and that they take account of the specific characteristics of the region, the necessary protection of the environment and the existence of numerous specific methods for the management of these areas, such as pastoralism, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to tourism. We must encourage sustainable tourism, promoting the natural wealth of these areas but refusing to allow mountains to be turned into leisure parks built of concrete – which has, unfortunately, happened all too frequently in the Alps, amongst other areas. In order to achieve this, we must encourage private initiative, we must help local SMEs, which often suffer as a result of their isolation and communication difficulties and we must maintain services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I was very pleased to hear what you had to say on this matter, particularly your reminder that it is important for services to be available everywhere, including the most remote areas. We must therefore give priority to structural projects aimed at promoting forms of transport that respect the environment and probably at giving a greater role to the railways. In mountain areas, this is, of course, more difficult, but, in the Alps, we have first-hand knowledge of these problems. We must also give priority to renewable energies such as water and wood and increase research into the prevention of both natural and material risks.</p>
<p class="contents">You also emphasised, however, the need to define mountain areas and not to forget hilly areas, because these play a crucial buffer role between mountains and lowland areas. We must also bear in mind, when talking about mountains, that the Alps are not the only ones; there are also the ancient massifs, which have their own specific characteristics and which must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the sustainable development of mountain areas can only be achieved if all partners are fully involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to you for your words, Mrs Schreyer, which show how interested the Commission is today in the range of problems facing mountain regions; we are quite aware of this. I would also like you to know that we firmly intend to work together to ensure that our areas, which have very well-defined handicaps, can be effectively protected. I shall therefore dwell on a few points that complement what has just been said.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want our territories to enjoy a form of economic development that comprehensively brings together preserving the countryside, preserving the type of farming that is characteristic of a mountain region and developing tourism, perhaps the Commission should listen more carefully to two or three points that are absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to recall that competition policy, as it is currently legislated for and regulated by the European Union, can by no means meet the needs of these regions, which do not have as many opportunities as others.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is crucial that Community competition legislation is adapted to take account of the specific characteristics of our regions, in order to reduce these economic and structural disadvantages. We must also put in place economic and financial support and tax concessions of a structural and sustainable nature. Such measures are essential if we wish to combat the desertification and the ageing of these regions because, at the moment, these developments appear to be inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to reiterate the importance of the EU’s environmental policy. This might be a taboo subject, but I hope that, whenever work is done in this field, thought is given to the applicability of these provisions, which were designed for an urban context, a context of lowlands that do not experience the same type of problem. Very often, when regions with a geographical handicap are forced to apply this regulatory approach, they find themselves totally disempowered. I would even say that they suffer genuine deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fervently hope that, together, armed with a coherent vision, we will be able to make progress, because enlargement will give mountain regions an extremely important role to play. Furthermore, in its work, the Convention must address our set of problems quite specifically. This concerns the territorial coherence and the cohesion of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is very positive that Parliament is able to discuss Europe’s role in this matter, particularly at the end of the Year of Mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome, along with the Commissioner who is present and those who are absent, the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective.

<p class="contents">First of all, as Mrs Guy-Quint said at the end of her speech, there is the major problem of introducing the issue of mountain regions into the treaties, which is absolutely essential. I think that we should take into account the important role of the Convention in this. We also need to make use of the two presidencies of the Council: the Greek Presidency and the Italian Presidency, two countries that are obviously affected by the problems of mountain regions. Introducing the issue into the treaties will provide an essential legal basis for obtaining a directive on mountain regions, in which we must of course solve the problem of competition. I therefore think that progress should be made in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we should also look at the prospects for regional policy for 2007-2013. Why not consider a specific structural fund for mountain regions? Or, better perhaps, for areas that are geographically or naturally handicapped? I will not add anything regarding agriculture. Agriculture remains essential for safeguarding mountain regions. The same can be said about tourism, which Mrs Grossetête discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a few words on the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps. Unfortunately, I do not think that the Commission has sufficiently monitored the work of this Convention. In this respect, we need to promote the transport protocol, in order to have a legal basis for taking specific measures to regulate the flow of heavy goods vehicles in mountainous areas. We obviously also need to look more closely at the issue of the funding of the major rail links such as Turin-Lyon, the Pyrenees and the Brenner pass, because in my view it is one of the keys to sustainable development in mountain regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanctuaries left in Europe. They need special status as sensitive areas. There is a clause in the Treaty for ultra-peripheral regions that provides for flexibility in adopting EU policies for special needs. This is what the Commission should be doing. It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is disappointing that the Commission had no initiatives this year concerning mountains – not even a communication or a White Paper. That would have been very welcome. The Commission, whilst pushing for the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps, states that the protocols have been ratified, but not everyone has ratified the transport protocol. It is essential, in relation to the threat that highways and the trans-European networks are having on mountain regions, that these protocols are properly implemented, not just in relation to the Alpine regions but also in other regions such as the Pyrenees which are in danger. We also need conventions for those areas to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to priorities, there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people. It is quite clear that the people who have opposed trans-European networks have voiced real and true concerns. Their concerns have been ignored to prioritise the trans-European networks. This is a conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot understand why the Commissioner is not putting pressure on Member States to ensure that they comply with Natura 2000 in the Alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of Community interest. That is disgraceful. I urge the Commissioner to put pressure on the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, they are seeking recognition of their handicaps. Regions can only be classified as mountainous on the basis of their altitude. Difficulty of access, harsh climate and declivity should also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Mountain regions are also seeking recognition for the quality of their products. They do have a reputation for high quality, but that can only be valued if consumers can identify the products. Steps are being taken on this and we should support them.</p>
<p class="contents">In promoting the mountain economy we need to take into account the fact that it is developing in a fragile environment that needs to be both preserved and developed. It is therefore difficult to find the balance, which needs to be supported by coherent legislation, which is not currently in place. I am thinking in particular of legislation on bringing livestock rearing and shepherds’ huts up to standard, which is difficult to implement in some mountain ranges.</p>
<p class="contents">Conservation programmes, such as the LIFE and NATURA 2000 programmes, for example, also have damaging consequences for economic activity. Mountainous regions will only remain open if everything possible is done to offer those who have chosen to live there prospects for the future, particularly young people.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need effective policies for mountainous regions that are adapted to each mountain range and based on management that is devised jointly by elected representatives, public services and professionals. These policies must work towards compensating for the excess cost of production, the opening up of regions, the diversification of activities, maintaining public services and developing specialised training and access to new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture, pastoralism and forestry play an essential role in mountain regions. Not only do they generate quality products, but they are also the only means of maintaining sites and keeping them secure.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain mountain ranges, however, pastoralism is being put at risk by the reintroduction of predatory species, and the poor management of their populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Diverse landscapes, high-quality products, ‘green lungs’, rare species: mountain regions are and must remain diverse. We should not make them into sanctuaries, or into deserts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ebner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mountain regions account for 30% of the surface area of the Community of Fifteen, and 10% of the population lives in mountain regions. Up to now, the European Union has viewed its policy on mountain regions as part of agricultural policy. I believe that this issue needs to be seen as a whole and not just sector by sector. Mountain regions account for over 50% of the total surface area of Member States such as Austria, Italy, Spain and Greece. For this reason it is absolutely essential, in addition to the issue of defining mountain regions, to consider the impact on various aspects of life, and for mountain regions to be seen as an area in which people live and not just as a business area for particular sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Commissioner has been able to inform us that a positive solution to the problem of creating a definition has now emerged. I think that in the final report to be presented in September 2003 this will provide us with a foundation on which we can build.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestions that it is too soon to be specific about financial issues may reflect an unavoidable degree of caution, but it is certainly not very satisfactory, Commissioner. I myself come from a mountain region which is in a relatively good position by virtue of its autonomous status. We have had some degree of migration, but only a low percentage in recent years. However, mountain regions in Piedmont, Lombardy or the Veneto, for example, have been totally depopulated and have ultimately become back gardens for affluent areas in the big cities – and I am sure that are many similar examples in other EU Member States. If you consider those, it becomes clear how absolutely necessary it is to give those who have stayed on positive signals that changes are being made and that they will not have to wait for almost another decade. One possible measure would be for short-term changes to be introduced in competition policy. Classifying mountain regions as sensitive zones in the treaties would also give a strong signal with this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, both Parliament and the Commission have treated policy on mountain regions rather shabbily. Up to now, we have only had three debates on this topic in this House, something that I regret, even though the Commission rounded off the International Year of Mountains by organising the conference you have already mentioned in an effort to form a picture of the situation and invite or listen to everyone involved in that Year. This conference was held in Brussels in October thanks to the efforts of Commissioners Fischler and Barnier. However, it would also certainly be advantageous if you could make a strong case to the Commission for it to take due account of the report on this subject adopted by the European Parliament on 9 September last year and to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me briefly mention the Alpine Convention. The Commission has been completely inactive in this area. The picture you painted was not quite accurate. It is not so much the signatory states to the Alpine Convention that have not done their homework, as the Commission, which has signed only three protocols and for cost reasons has even stopped turning up to meetings. I think there is an urgent need for action here.</p>

The very fact that this debate is being held is an achievement and I would say that, this year, in honour of the International Year of Mountains, the European Parliament too has endeavoured to make its contribution. The Commission and I remember that memorable seminar of 17-18 October, we discussed this matter in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and Agenda 2000 too, and we are discussing it today. It is a shame that, as always, this is an intimate conversation between a few friends, but that has always been the fate of the mountains in the history of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if you were to do a little research on the Internet and search in our databases for the word ‘mountain’, you would find three references to past resolutions. The first was tabled by a certain Mr Colleselli in 1983, the second tabled by myself in 1998 and the third tabled in 2001 by Mr Ebner, who spoke just now. If you add these names to the few Members present today in this Chamber, you have the mountain people, the champions of the mountains, if I may be so bold as to use that phrase. However, mountains, as we know, cover 30% of the Community’s territory. In countries such as my own, Italy, and in Greece, Portugal and Spain too, over 50% of the land is defined as mountainous. Why, then, has there been so little attention paid to mountains throughout history? Because the inhabitants of the mountain regions are few. Between 5 and 7% of the European citizens live in mountain regions, on average. There are few inhabitants who are therefore unable to form a strong lobby in terms of either numbers or wealth. That is a shame, for this may well be a historic time for the mountains in terms of their future and prospects. First and foremost, they have to convert their diversity from the weakness it has been hitherto into added value in order to start to exploit the genuine potential they offer. Europe is not a depressed region: it is a complex, complete economic and social system. I would say that, strangely, Europe does not need economic assistance so much as credibility and specific legislation which will allow it to launch its initiatives for the future. That, Madam President, is why, if you search for a directive in the database, you will find that the most recent directive dates back to 1975. Twenty-seven, almost thirty years have passed: the mountains have changed dramatically in that time but we are still working with a very outdated directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, can we suggest? Some of the Members have already made proposals and I too would like to make some demands. We must cling to the proposals of Article 158, which the Commissioner mentioned just now. This article calls upon the European Union to reduce and avoid development divides between the regions of Europe. Then the same article recognises the specific situation of the Community’s islands. We are not demanding another article or a different legal basis: we are asking for the specific situation of the mountains, at least, to be recognised alongside the specific situation of the islands. It is clear for all to see that the mountains are different from the rest of the territory: they are different environmentally, biologically and in terms of natural history and social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would mention a suggestion made by Mr Mantovani – who is unable to be here because he was unable to get a flight at an appropriate time – who laments the fact that, in addition to the environmental and economic problems, life is difficult in the mountain regions when it comes to healthcare too. When a hospital closes in a mountain region a serious problem is created. When, in particular, healthcare networks are insufficient, genuine difficulties ensue. That is why the mountains need overall, general measures. All we have to do is give them a hand: they are not asking for aid, they are just asking for a little attention and, as I said just now, for the specific nature of their situation to be recognised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
