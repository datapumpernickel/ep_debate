<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago the Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously approved the recommendation which is today being considered by Parliament. It had previously made a considerable effort to speed up and rationalise the negotiation of the issue, believing that voting on the new European Parliament and Council regulation on development cooperation with South Africa was an important and urgent matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It was important because South Africa is one of the countries which receives the most funding from the European Union for its development process. It was urgent because the regulation which forms the basis of this cooperation and which has been in force for five years expired on 31 December 1999, from which date the different procedures in operation were left without a proper legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very worrying that we should find ourselves in such a situation. In fact, in the first six months of 1999, our Parliament considered the first text proposed by the Commission, adopting six amendments and forwarding them to the Council for their consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the delay occurred, since the Council took no less than eight months to present their position to us. This took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which I just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council finally presented its proposal. Their text adopted most of the amendments which Parliament had approved on first reading and, in particular, the Council put considerably more emphasis on the references to combating poverty and achieving the international development objectives, agreed on the basis of United Nations conventions and resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Having examined the Council’s proposal, the Committee on Development and Cooperation considered it necessary to try to prevent the negotiation being prolonged by a third reading. In other words, we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential, and even then in a spirit of great moderation. There only remained two questions which appear in the amendments and which, in the form of a recommendation, our committee is submitting to the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question refers to commitology. The Council wanted the Committee of Experts to control all cooperation projects relating to South Africa with a budget of over EUR 3 million. However, we believed that this committee should guide and monitor the broad approaches to development cooperation with South Africa and only directly control larger projects, leaving the smaller ones to the normal procedures, which are the Commission’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Having considered all the main issues, the amendment we are presenting today finally raises the Council’s proposal from 3 to 5 million, and this committee, whose members represent the various Member States, will therefore have fewer projects to deal with and will therefore be able to concentrate more on a global view of such an important field of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal concerns the budgetary framework for development cooperation between the European Union and South Africa for the 7-year period, including 2000, which is referred to in the regulation under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous five years the budgetary framework had been EUR 125 million per year. The Council, with a view to budgetary restriction, decreased that allocation in its proposal and set it at EUR 112.5 million per year.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, while we are signing an important Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa, it does not seem politically acceptable to send a message of financial cuts. On the contrary, we should at least maintain and, where possible, increase these contributions, if only as a token gesture, although we share the concern with regard to the available resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal approved by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking, was extremely reasonable: the EUR 123.5 million already allocated for 2000 and the EUR 127 million for each of the subsequent six years, amounting to a budgetary framework of EUR 885.5 million for the seven years laid down in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Both amendments seem well-considered. The aim is to avoid a third reading, put an end to the current intolerable legal vacuum and provide significant political impetus to our development cooperation with South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">By asking you to support our proposals, we hope that the common sense and moderation which Parliament is showing will be understood by the Council. We also hope that these proposals are acceptable to the Commission, despite the fact that theirs – 25 million for the commitology question and 850.5 million for the budgetary framework – are somewhat different to the ones that we are presenting.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are not understood, it will be entirely down to the Council or the Commission that we become involved in a third reading, with the consequences which the lack of a proper legal basis may have on the projects in operation in our development cooperation with South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure for the budgetary framework suggested by the Commission, which is very close to our own proposal, should in any event have arrived at the Committee on Development and Cooperation on time, so that Parliament could have approved it and above all with the certainty that, in the event that we had adopted it, the Council would also have accepted it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report under discussion here on the Union's development cooperation with South Africa, on which I particularly congratulate the rapporteur, is, leaving aside its content, a striking example of the Council's delaying tactics towards the European Parliament. This is actually an unproblematic regulation and also, in fact, an unproblematic report. That the Union should support development cooperation with South Africa, bearing in mind that it is one of the more successful countries on the subcontinent, has never been called into question. This is therefore predominantly about renewing the legal base for this cooperation, as the preceding regulation expired in December 1999. Our former fellow-MEP, Mr Fassa, presented the report for its first reading in Parliament in May of last year. The Council accepted nearly all of the amendments. Nevertheless, I do wonder why the Council's common position was officially only sent to Parliament in March of this year. Of course, the rapporteur also referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Delays of this kind, which might perhaps be explained by the trade agreement being negotiated in parallel, never fail, however, to amaze me. No doubt people in South Africa itself are also asking themselves what conclusions they should draw from the Council's behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I should specifically like to thank the rapporteur for making it possible, thanks to the fast-track procedure, for this report to be on the plenary agenda now, as early as May, thus allowing us to avoid any potential problems caused by a lack of legal bases in our development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content is concerned, some areas of uncertainty had been clarified in preliminary informal consultations with the Council, which meant that this report could restrict itself to two points, the first of which is increasing the total budget to EUR 885.5 million for the period for 2000-2006, a customary parliamentary request and a necessary one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the threshold of EUR 5 million, which has now been settled on, constitutes a good compromise in my view. Small projects can be planned and implemented efficiently by the institutions and organisations on the ground. The limit of EUR 5 million gives sufficient room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">In making these efforts, the rapporteur has, for his part, done everything within his power to present a proper report on the regulation. I very much hope that we will indeed still be able to avoid the danger of a third reading, Mr Martínez Martínez. For the time being I offer you my warmest congratulations on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The full significance of this report is, however, only appreciated when it is seen in the context of the other efforts being made to intensify cooperation with South Africa, first and foremost the trade agreement already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union continues to attach great importance to stable development in South Africa, not only for the sake of the people there, but also because this is in the interests of the development of its neighbours north of the Limpopo.</p>
<p class="contents">The South Africans have already managed to put an end to legal discrimination against the majority of the population and to hold democratic elections. Today it is a question of anchoring the rule of law more firmly in the State. All sections of the population and all civil servants must feel a duty primarily to this State, which is under the rule of law and no longer, as they did in the past, only to their own section of the population or even to their personal associates of whom they need to take care.</p>
<p class="contents">From a political point of view, the Union’s adoption of this new regulation is not only an acknowledgement of the results achieved by the reform process hitherto. It comes with definite expectations for the future, including securing law and order in all parts of the country. I read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level. I hear with unease that corruption is also gaining ground in the police force, and that in rural areas and in townships there are police no-go areas where the poorest of the poor are left at the mercy of gangs. Conversely, those who have something to lose wall themselves in and for their own security hire those who previously had professional roles in the army and the police. Thus a two-tier society again emerges, and, what is more, this is in the sensitive area of internal security. Since law and order were de facto suspended in neighbouring Zimbabwe, the morale on commercial farms south of the Limpopo has hit rock bottom.</p>
<p class="contents">This illustrates another decisive expectation which we have of South Africa: to set an example and be a stabilising influence on its neighbours to the north. I expect the South African Government to take on its regional responsibilities. President Mbeki should adopt just as clear a stance as has the former President, Mr Mandela – whom we all hold in high esteem – on the events in Zimbabwe. Standing by and letting it happen or talking up the situation helps neither the farmers nor the hundreds of thousands in Zimbabwe who are dependent on the farms for a functioning infrastructure. Food, housing, and sometimes clinics and schools are made available to farm workers and their families. The situation is similar in large areas of South Africa. Obviously these are not exemplary structures, but before they are abandoned we have to ensure that those who ought to be benefiting from them receive something better in their place. South Africa must now, in its own interests too, exert massive influence on Mugabe; otherwise it too will soon be threatened by waves of starving refugees if seed cannot be sown on the farms there now. In its own country, not only would the rand come under increasing pressure, but the faith in the government shown by important sections of the population who would normally supply the nation's food would be severely shaken. This cannot be in the interests of South Africa and it cannot be in our interests either!</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this regulation, the Union is showing that it still backs the economic, political and societal reform process in South Africa. The South African Government needs all sections of society to have lasting confidence in the development of the country. I hope that this expectation too will be taken seriously in Pretoria. The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We thank you very much for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly in a very serious situation. The regulation for South Africa expired on 31 December 1999. It is clear, as the rapporteur has suggested, that we need to proceed with some urgency in order to provide a legal base for our essential work in South Africa. This budget line is the work of the European Parliament. I was the budget rapporteur in 1994 when the Development Committee established the line. That was because we wanted to see practical and tangible assistance for South Africa's peaceful transition to a free and democratic country. Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Republic, with its new President Mr Thabo Mbeki, faces new challenges which, in my view, require sustained partnership with the European Union. This is not the time, as others have suggested, to have the kind of mean-spirited delays that we have seen from the Council; neither is it the time for political point-scoring by other institutions of the European Union. Indeed, it is my view that the Council has rather cynically orchestrated the eight-month delay in response to the first reading in order that it could better manage its negotiations on the South Africa trade and development agreements. This has put life-saving programmes at risk and any delay now would exacerbate the existing impression in South Africa of a European Union which seeks only to serve its own interests first.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming as this does after ouzo and grappa, we are in danger of sending a very bad signal to South Africa. Decisions need to be made. We cannot risk delay. For example, I am very familiar with the South African Human Rights Foundation. That would be endangered. The Foundation for Cultural Initiatives programme, the South Africa Labour Development Trust, policing in the Eastern Cape – all these programmes would be very seriously threatened by delays. If there is delay, if agreement is not reached on the regulation, then new programmes will be affected too. Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear what we are talking about. We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas. We would endanger the SADC HIV/Aids Programme, regarded by all as being one of the most efficient the European Union operates. We risk jeopardising economic developments in the Eastern Cape and work in the Eastern Cape with the Ministry of Education. We risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament we have to make every effort now, as the rapporteur has said, to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people of South Africa. The European Parliament position is, and always has been, realistic and morally right. However I must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay. As usual we should make it very clear that we in the Development Committee regard the budget figure that we have here before us, as purely indicative. We see it as a reference point only, not as anything that we will not seek to change when it comes to our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first year of the South Africa Trade Agreement. How does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations? We must continue our commitment to supporting South African efforts to overcome the legacy of apartheid. To do that we have to have a regulation sooner rather than later. I hope that after we have heard the Commissioner we will have the opportunity to discuss his views further and to discuss the very deeply worrying issues which delay on this regulation raises.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, the disparities in income between the population groups are still shocking and deprived areas in terms of housing, education and health care have not caught up by a long way. Frustration is mounting, as is evident from the unprecedented crime rate and outrageous violence both indoors and outdoors. They may want to escape their past, but they are compromising their own future in the process. The key goal of development strategy should therefore be to correct the imbalance in growth created by apartheid. If not, that country will not be able to enjoy stability, will deter foreign investors and will remain poor when it could be rich. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, it is South Africa first and foremost that has to set its own house in order, but Europe can and must make a substantial contribution to the development process. We therefore lend our support to the cooperation agreement, on the basis of the EUR 885.5 million, as proposed by our excellent rapporteur. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has sat on the regulation for far too long. All the signs are there that its association with the negotiations regarding the trade agreement was spurious. The involvement of the Member States via the committee should focus more on the strategy and the indicative programme rather than on the individual projects. A maximum of 5 million seems very reasonable to me. This does not, however, relieve the European Union of its task of monitoring all projects well, down to the tiniest, and to evaluate them at regular intervals. The Commission delegation must be sufficiently equipped to be able to do this independently and to a professional standard. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, South Africa has enormous potential. There is so much there which so few have enjoyed. Economic growth is a necessary but not an adequate condition for development. What is needed is for resources to be better distributed and correctly allocated to meet all social needs. The apartheid regime has been abolished, all that is left to tackle now is apartheid itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I strongly support his aim of getting this regulation brought into force as quickly as possible with no third reading. The rapporteur has been very generous in his interpretation of the Council's inexplicable 8-month delay in responding to Parliament's six amendments during the first reading. If there were any evidence that the Council was deliberately holding back this regulation to give it greater leverage during the negotiations of the broader trade and development cooperation agreement, that indeed would be extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to the substance of the issue, on the budget it is completely unacceptable that the EU should be offering a budget cut in comparison to former years, particularly at this moment in our relationship with South Africa. There is a very real risk of this triggering an even greater loss of faith by South Africa in the EU. Let us not forget that this follows hard on the heels of the protracted and frequently bitter negotiations of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement where the EU acted very dismally indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">On numerous occasions, it was EU reluctance to improve access for South African agricultural goods which nearly blocked the whole deal and to follow this up with yet another dishonourable act would be extremely unfortunate. Perhaps there is an image abroad that South Africa is an increasingly developed country and does not really need these funds. Let us not forget that in spite of the great leaps forward that South Africa has taken, the life of many South Africans is still one of extreme poverty without work or land or a decent home. An estimated 42% of black South Africans are jobless as compared with just 4% of whites. A quarter of schools have no water within walking distance. Half of South African households are classed as poor. 65% of adult South Africans are illiterate and 10 million South Africans live in informal shacks or on land they neither own nor rent. Let us not forget either that the Commission and Council turned down the idea of a separate new financial instrument to give support to neighbouring countries which need to adjust themselves to the new framework resulting from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. I am not as reassured on this point as the rapporteur and I would have preferred to see a separate budget line which could have been seen and monitored more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries' transition. The loss of customs duty alone is extremely high in some cases. In Swaziland for example, this accounts for up to 40% of all government revenue. In spite of its own challenges, South Africa is already demonstrating its commitment to support its neighbours in the region. For example, in its agreement to a highly asymmetrical liberalisation agreement with the other SADC countries which will benefit those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs the same generosity of spirit. It should honour its initial financial pledges to South Africa and provide significant support to the neighbouring countries during their transition period.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a day too soon, because the European Programme for the Reconstruction and Development of South Africa has been without a legal basis since late 1999. In the light of this, the continuity of the development connection has been in the balance. </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the drive he has displayed in dealing with this subject matter. I share his criticism regarding the eight months which the Council deemed necessary to formulate its position. He is right in claiming that a distinction must be drawn between this regulation and the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between Europe and South Africa. Although development cooperation and trade are very much interrelated, they should not be played off against each other. The deliberate delay in approving these regulations would seem to suggest that there is little real involvement with South Africa. This is irrespective of how fair the European negotiating position is in terms of trade. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, such a stance does not fit in with the Commission’s strategy in terms of South Africa which it has outlined in its 2000-2002 Country Strategy. This document addresses both the fight against poverty and improvement in infrastructure. I did wonder, however, why it only mentions the European Union’s development instrument in passing. Would the Commission be able to answer that? I would also like to know from the Commission to what extent South Africa’s qualified Lomé membership overlaps with the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development. I am, by the way, very grateful to the Commission for the large amount of information on South Africa which is available on the Internet and which has been laid out in a readily understood format. This is an example to draw on when it comes to determining the strategy for other countries!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with just one remark for the rapporteur. I can imagine that he is intent on keeping the EUR 910 million budget for development cooperation with South Africa. I, however, attach less importance to this, given the limited financial resources for foreign policy and the major challenges in other parts of the world. What counts is the quality of cooperation with South Africa, which, in my opinion, is sound at present, particularly on account of the regional projects which have been financed over the past couple of years. This is why South Africa’s neighbouring countries can also benefit from European development projects. It seems that coherence and consistency are gradually gaining ground in the EU’s development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perhaps a sad indictment on the European institutions that, five months after the expiry date of the legal base to this Council regulation, it has only now come before Parliament, thanks, as the rapporteur and almost every other speaker has said, to an 8-month delay by the Council in responding to Parliament's first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely we cannot continue to work in this way. It is interesting to note that half this report is taken up by the procedural points the rapporteur has had to work his way through. Now it has returned to us it is particularly pleasing that the Council has adopted the thrust of most of our amendments. Most welcome is the fact that the Council has made poverty alleviation a top priority. This should strengthen the partnership between South Africa and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just spent a week in South Africa and there is much appreciation for all that the EU is doing to stabilise their fragile democracy. Only by rapidly improving living standards, particularly in health, education and employment, will stability remain. There was much resentment against some nation states at the hold-ups there had been over the new trade agreement with particular reference to spirit names.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing much for South Africa and I hope, in return, President Mbeki will work for peace in the region, with particular reference to Zimbabwe. The implication in the rapporteur's report that this regulation may have been delayed because it was being used as a bargaining chip is very worrying. The Commission might like to comment on this particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to hear from the Commission on how we can streamline the system. In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen. I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics, such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes. I would also like to see delegate offices strengthened with more and better staff to be able to cope more efficiently with monitoring and evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is bound to have an impact on neighbouring states and I hope the Commission will take this into consideration. The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future. My group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in. We would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the people of South Africa have regained their freedom, this is, of course, for the most part thanks to their persistence and courage, as well as to that of their leaders, but also, it must be said, to the political and financial support provided by European Union Member States for the reform process in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, the cooperation agreement signed on 10 October 1994 was a strong message that we sent this people treated so badly by history. I must confess that the slow progress in Council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty to show this country legitimate solidarity must not and cannot be sacrificed on the altar of national trading interests. On the trade agreement, which, need I remind you, we endorsed by a large majority in this very Chamber last October, we must avoid disagreements which obstruct the adoption of this cooperation regulation. Such an attitude would be tantamount to appalling blackmail on the part of Europe and would not be true to the spirit behind the new development and cooperation agreements with the ACP countries, i.e. establishing contracts which respect the identity, culture and dignity of each partner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the regional cooperation aspect of this regulation, I should like, in turn, to draw the Council and the Commission’s attention to the risks of economic destabilisation which may be engendered by the regulation, and even more so by the trade agreement with South Africa. We shall have to be particular attentive to the effects that these agreements may have on the ever vulnerable balance within the Southern African Customs Union. I am also thinking of Namibia and Swaziland, and even Lesotho and Botswana, which are a long way from receiving the same amount of aid from Europe. I feel that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, take steps to arrive at an agreement with the authorities of these countries in order to compensate for any losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in conclusion, acknowledging our rapporteur for his clear-sightedness and for his talents as a negotiator, I should like to express my complete agreement with him on the need to remedy the existing legal vacuum to enable these agreements to come into force. We must put an end, as a matter of urgency, to these long months of hesitation and delay, seen as so many negative signs by South Africa’s fledgling democracy, which expects more from Europe than narrow calculations in order to safeguard limited interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years, we supported the fight against apartheid and welcomed the new South Africa with excitement. In 1995, it became our key partner in development cooperation. The fact that that country received most support from Europe was justified. After all, South Africa had to be – and still is – the driving force behind development in Southern and Central Africa. But it took too long for programmes to get underway and, when the date for the legal basis lapsed, we did not have a new regulation in place for our development cooperation. In his eminent report, the rapporteur emphatically referred to the expiry date of 31 December 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council needed no fewer than eight months to determine its position. This was, of course, not down to fundamental differences of opinion, but, as many of the delegates have already hinted at here, because the development money was used as a means of exerting pressure to secure European trade interests and to exact a trade agreement, in which our much talked of alcoholic beverages had to be protected once again. We are deeply ashamed about such a state of affairs, which resembles a cattle market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another reason to feel ashamed. A proportion of the money which we want to spend in the European countries to reconstruct Kosovo is being taken from the development cooperation with South Africa. Instead of increasing the funding by 1%, in line with inflation, and reaching the amount of EUR 885.5 million, as is also suggested by our rapporteur, we will be proposing a 10% reduction. I think this is disgraceful. </p>
<p class="contents">Eventually, Commissioner Schreyer proposed EUR 850 million, or 121 million annually, 5 million less to invest in the fight against poverty which we deem so important. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we will naturally assent to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Cooperation and Development. Poverty is an injustice. We want the reconstruction of Kosovo. We are happy to finance it, but not with money intended to combat poverty. This is unethical. </p>
<p class="contents">We also support the second amendment. It may seem less important, but I think that the resources for the procedure should be retained. If we oblige our committee to address the individual programme points, there will be considerably less time and energy for tackling the efficiency of the programme as a whole. This is why we give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and South Africa must not be damaged. South Africa ought to – and must – be the European Union’s greatest and best friend in Africa, for South Africa will play a quite decisive role in the whole continent’s future. In times of large-scale conflict on the African continent, for example in Congo, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Rwanda and Algeria – not to mention the intense unrest of recent months in Zimbabwe and the hatred which President Mugabe has been stirring up there – South Africa and the country’s remarkably strong democratic institutions constitute a constructive and stabilising factor in leading Africa towards a brighter and more peaceful future. </p>
<p class="contents">South Africa has a vigorous constitution with a clear commitment to human rights and freedoms. The country has a constitutional court whose judgements are respected by the president. Free elections have been held. There is freedom of the press, and the office of president was in a peaceful and orderly state when the country’s great reconciler and nation builder, Nelson Mandela, left it. The Truth Commission, led by the Anglican bishop, Desmond Tutu, has demonstrated its willingness to strive for genuine reconciliation in South Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">Sweden’s prime minister called the Cairo Conference, held earlier this year between the EU and Africa, “the start of something new and great”. A democratic and reconciled South Africa is the prerequisite for this “something new and great”, in which Africa and the countries of Europe meet on a new and equal footing and look forward, instead of remaining stuck in the old colonial period. </p>
<p class="contents">South Africa is a necessary engine of democracy for the whole of South Africa and for Africa in its entirety.

In the meantime, as you will remember, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation last September on the basis of the Kinnock report, whose trade component was implemented in January of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the fundamental components of the trade agreement concerns wines, and South Africa committed itself, under the terms of the agreement signed at the Berlin Summit in March 1999, immediately to cease using certain Community designations of origin, such as, specifically, “Port” and “Sherry”, which it had been using illegally for twelve years.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a few incredibly intricate episodes, successive adjournments and time-wasting manoeuvres by the South African negotiators in accepting a regulatory text for this agreement, both parties finally agreed that a new draft of the regulations for this agreement on wines, which is due to enter into force by 1 September, is to be laid down by the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, however, received information to the effect that the South Africans are still raising problems with regard to a draft which faithfully reflects the Berlin Agreement. They are trying to have these wine-producing issues covered by the WTO TRIPS dossier, which the European Union feels does not adequately protect Community designations. Furthermore, it appears to be a position that has been reached in conjunction with other New World wine-producing countries, given that the South Africans were negotiating bilateral agreements on wines with the European Union and then they suddenly changed their minds and wanted to postpone everything.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these issues, I cannot agree with the rapporteur when he asks Parliament, as proof of good faith, to approve this framework regulation as a matter of urgency, without linking it to the trade aspect of the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation. I do not agree because all the European Union’s behaviour up until now has been nothing but a huge demonstration of good faith, to the extent that, contrary to what had previously been laid down, we accepted the commercial implementation of the agreement without the regulations for the agreement on wines being established. The time has come to say enough is enough! Cooperation requires a positive attitude of good faith and responsibility on the part of both cooperating parties. As this has not been the case, I cannot, in all conscience, support the rapporteur’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson, Poul,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, the Commission is appreciative of the rapporteur's excellent work and welcomes the recommendation on the Council common position which reflects Parliament's commitment to assist the new South Africa. We too are worried about the delays in the adoption of the regulation and share the view that quick adoption of the regulation on the European programme for reconstruction and development is now becoming essential and critical. It would be a signal to South Africa of our dedication to the effective entry into force of the agreement on trade development and cooperation and would prevent new tensions arising around issues still to be discussed concerning wines and spirits or fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the Community is unable to adopt the regulation in time, our development programme for this year will be jeopardised and confidence undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">We also totally share the rapporteur's view that the Council common position contains useful improvements to the Commission's proposal. However, on commitology and the financial framework, we also consider that the common position is inadequate and cannot be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as regards Amendment No 1, on Article 8(5) and (6) on commitology, your proposal for a EUR 5m threshold is, to be frank, somewhat disappointing compared to the level of EUR 25m we had proposed. We proposed such a level in order to use the committed resources in a more efficient and useful way and to deal with strategic issues rather than the details of individual projects. But in the South Africa case, we are ready to accept the EUR 5m threshold simply in order not to delay a decision. It appears from our programming discussions with the South African Government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the Member States. The EUR 5m level gives us enough room to proceed quickly with some small projects, for instance preparatory actions or pilot operations. But we definitely need to make clear that no precedent should be created for the Council to impose low commitology thresholds. I should like to retain the possibility of increasing this threshold for the South Africa budget line in the future, if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 2, Article 10(1) on the financial framework: the Commission has been aware on the one hand of the need to respect the political commitment in the trade and development cooperation agreement to maintain assistance to South Africa but, on the other hand, we have to take into account the very difficult budgetary situation caused by the new commitments made for assistance in the Balkans. As a result, the Commission has agreed on the necessary budget adjustments to accommodate new needs. This exercise has been very complex: it has required a very sensitive balancing of the political priorities across the EU's regional programmes. But we envisage stabilisation for South Africa at the average level of around EUR 122m per annum, with a global figure of some EUR 850.5m in the period 2000-2006. This is below your proposal of EUR 885.5m but it is significantly higher than the EUR 787.5m the Council proposed. The South African programme is in fact one of the least affected by the proposed changes within heading IV and the adjustment will not affect the nature and scope of the programme as envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand your determination not to reduce the financial amounts for development aid to South Africa. However, I find it absolutely necessary that the regulation is adopted in time to ensure uninterrupted implementation of activities in South Africa. This situation is indeed very critical and not a normal, routine situation – but unfortunately it is what we are facing – and I feel an obligation to do my utmost to secure agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the proposed approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore anxious both to discuss the matter again with the Committee on Development and Cooperation in Parliament and before that to seek a response from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing that in mind, I should welcome it if Parliament would consider whether the vote on Amendment No 2 could be postponed so that these discussions can take place. This is the safest way to reduce the risk of a much more serious and longer delay threatening the credibility of our cooperation with South Africa.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that this situation disturbs me, because we are all working very quickly and the Commission seems to be saying that, since we are in a hurry, we must drive the car very slowly.</p>
<p class="contents">On principle, I am always willing to discuss issues again. Firstly, I must thank the spokespeople of the different Groups for their support, although I believe that they are lending their support to a very modest position by the committee, almost a critical type of support, because the Committee on Development and Cooperation should have gone much further than it decided. I repeat: in principle, I would not be opposed, but I do not believe that Parliament is in favour of delaying the vote. I do not feel at the moment that Parliament wishes to delay the vote. That would mean inviting the Commissioner to the Committee on Development next week and postponing our decision until June. I would not be opposed to that and I do not reject that possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must say, Mr President, that it worries me profoundly that Parliament should have to take responsibility for prolonging something which, in fact, has been prolonged by all parties. Everyone has prolonged this process: the Council and the Commission. Now the pressure is on Parliament because we have been told that, if we do not accept the positions of the Council and of the Commission, the development programmes will come to a standstill, which would be terrible. I agree that it would be terrible if the cooperation programmes came to a standstill. However, Mr President, we should take note of who is being pressurised and who really bears the responsibility for prolonging this process and taking it to a third reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I would ask you to examine whether it would be proper to consult Parliament tomorrow on whether or not to vote on our positions. If we do vote on them tomorrow, it will fall to the Council and the Commission to ensure that the situation is not prolonged, which would create serious difficulties for South Africa and our own dignity. We must ask ourselves whether we are here solely to accept, at any time and under any kind of pressure, what the Council or the Commission proposes. If that is the case, then Parliament is unnecessary and all our dignity as an institution has been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month. I believe that it would be very dangerous to prolong this process, but, in any event, we must not take responsibility. The responsibility falls to those people who have dragged it out until now and who seem to want it to last even longer, perhaps because the issue of the designations of origin of wines and alcoholic drinks is being negotiated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
