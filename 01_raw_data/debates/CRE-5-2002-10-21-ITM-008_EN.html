<p class="contents">As she points out, hacking, viruses and denial of service can have very serious consequences, both as a result of individuals acting in their own interests and as part of organised crime or terrorism. The Commission proposal aims to approximate criminal offences of unauthorised access or illegal interference with information systems and follows consultation with professional sectors and with the authorities responsible for implementing the law, as well as discussions with experts in the European Union forum on cybercrime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is seeking to establish a degree of approximation in legislation at European level, but which is in line and coherent with the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention of November 2001. Article 3 of our proposal defines unauthorised access to an information system as an offence. What we are attempting to do is to punish hacking. Such unauthorised access must be punished when perpetrated against an information system that is subject to specific protection measures or with the intent to cause damage to a singular or collective person, or with the intention of obtaining economic benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, we are making illegal interference with information systems a crime, thereby addressing the issue of attacks by means of viruses and denial of service as well as the disruption of websites. The Commission proposal requires all offences to be committed in an intentional and unauthorised way and focuses above all on serious cases, the criteria for decisions on which must be decided on by the judges of the courts in each Member State. The proposal caters for aggravating circumstances and also seeks to force Member States to designate operational points of contact, available around the clock and seven days a week, with a view to facilitating the exchange of information on attacks against information systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the rapporteur is entirely right to emphasise that the actions to be punished should not be considered to be insignificant or minor. Recital 12 of the Commission proposal therefore suggests that we must avoid excessive criminalisation, particularly for behaviour which is not very serious or which is even insignificant. The Commission agrees, for example, with the proposal for an amendment tabled by the rapporteur on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of data protection under the third pillar, we are working on this matter, but I would like to ask Parliament not to suspend implementation of this proposal for a framework decision until there is a specific instrument to protect data under the third pillar. Instead, I think that specific reference must be made to respect for the principles established in the Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection, which must be fully complied with in this field of the framework decision’s implementation. As a matter of fact, this was the solution adopted for the issue of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. I wish to thank the rapporteur once again for her contribution to this important debate which, I believe, has been much hoped for by public opinion in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cederschiöld (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, we have followed each other’s efforts for many years in the fight against cybercrime and no doubt have many basic values in common. Mr Vitorino knows as well as I do that we are concerned here with a framework directive. Because the European Parliament has significantly weaker decision-making powers than it ought to have where framework directives are concerned, I would take this opportunity to draw attention to this deficiency, as I also did in the case of the point raised by Mr Vitorino when commenting upon the amendment. I understand his point of view very well, but it is from our position here in Parliament that we must exert pressure on the Convention and on developments, for what we have here are extremely worrying threats to our common union. </p>
<p class="contents">There is information to the effect that criminal organisations have infiltrated vital infrastructures. They have obtained access to digital circuit-breakers, which means that electricity and water can be switched off and transport brought to a halt. In particular, there have been incidents in the area of aviation that have affected the operation of control towers. Terrorists could switch off both gas and water, increasing the damage caused in connection with a physical attack. That is, of course, a situation that we must do everything to avert. We are concerned here with cross-border crime. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is a good one. I admire Mr Vitorino for his ability to present sound proposals, in spite of<span class="italic"> </span>the defective framework he has to work within. The idea of these minimum/maximum penalties that we traditionally use for harmonisation purposes is sensible and fair. It may also put an end to the type of ‘legal shopping’, which we cannot of course encourage, in which criminals have the option of being sentenced in countries that have lower penalties. </p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned here with intent. That too is abundantly clear, which I think is very commendable. There must be intent, the purpose being to cause damage or to procure an economic benefit. I think that this is a proper approach. I approve of the spirit of the Commission’s work, but I want to repeat that the decision-making process is unacceptable. The EC Court of Justice has no competence in the area of the third pillar. The current system causes democratic rights to be neglected. Human rights lie outside the jurisdiction of the Court. That is why I give extra special emphasis to this in an amendment, something which Mr Vitorino too surely understands. The crimes in question can have long-term consequences, and they have direct effects upon people’s private lives. We must obtain democratic control, and I should therefore like this legislation to begin to apply from the day on which we have proper protection in this area and also data protection in the area of the third pillar. That is something I should obviously like to see right now. I fully appreciate that the operational contact points have to be set up. I do not want to slow things down in any way, but I want to give some impetus to democratic development. </p>
<p class="contents">That is as far as we can get with today’s decision-making system. I hope, however, that a new constitution will mean our sorting out these issues and really being able to obtain a legitimate system. Commissioner Vitorino has already made positive comments about the amendments. That also applies to the subtle attitude to legal persons. I am also pleased that we have a common position where minors are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs. I have tried to strike a balance involving as effective an assault upon crime as possible. At the same time, I have tried, within our present framework, to raise the profile of human rights and the protection of privacy. </p>
<p class="contents">I want the Convention to feel it is under pressure, which is why I have written in this way. That is something which Mr Vitorino surely understands, and I hope that he will help exercise this pressure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are facing a problem of considerable topical interest, which has assumed worrying dimensions and which has today become a form of organised crime, with a transnational nature, which must be responded to at Community level, because the new information and communication technologies have a fundamental impact on the daily life of the citizens and on the economy of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that there should be rigorous protection against potential abuses or criminal acts. Hacking, in whatever form, is an economic risk, risks a loss of confidence in electronic commerce and also poses a threat to individual privacy. The targets of these attacks are not only network operators, Internet service providers and electronic commerce businesses, but also private persons who have no commercial intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of information systems is a crucial element in creating an area of freedom, security and justice. We must, however, guarantee that no restrictions are imposed on fundamental rights and freedoms, that fundamental principles of law are not changed and that individual acts that take place purely as a result of mistakes in the use of new technologies are not punished. As I have already said in this plenary, security is and must be only one tool for safeguarding these fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cederschiöld Report contains five essential points: firstly, the approximation of criminal law in the Member States in the field of attacks against information systems; secondly, stepping up police and judicial cooperation in this field; thirdly, enhancing prevention, promoting a culture of security, making actors aware of security risks to information networks; fourth, the existence of flexibility in criminal law on unimportant issues or those of lesser importance, thereby avoiding imposing binding, criminalising measures at European level; fifthly and lastly, and this demonstrates special consideration for young people, to allow judges the possibility to acquit minors who are charged for the first time with this type of offence, and who did not commit this misdemeanour with the intent of causing damage or procuring an economic benefit or creating prospective profits for a criminal organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Basically, we believe that it would be preferable to address the issue of crimes committed on the Internet with criminal law instruments already in existence rather than producing piles of specific legislation based on technological considerations which, moreover, would be characterised by the flaws which I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why we will be voting against the motion. These problems were essentially also raised by Mrs Cederschiöld and Mr Coelho, but we feel they are vitally important and cannot be ignored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Viruses can have unforeseen consequences for those using computers. Examples might include data altered or destroyed by a virus in air traffic control systems or in files held by healthcare units such as the intensive care department of a hospital. This could have fateful consequences for both individuals and large numbers of people. Computer viruses in the future could cause legal uncertainty on a large scale and prevent electronic commerce and people’s private business from being transacted electronically by sabotaging the reliability of electronic documents. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, our efforts to promote electronic commerce, for example, by creating the necessary legislative frameworks, will be in vain if these systems are not dependable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned about the opinions of experts who say that those who are creating new viruses these days are less and less those who are just playing around. At first viruses were turned out by schoolchildren and students, who produced them mainly for fun and publicity, but more and more frequently viruses can destroy hard disks and all installed programs. According to the experts macro viruses already account for 80% of all viruses.</p>
<p class="contents">People want to protect their privacy from intruders. I therefore agree with the views expressed earlier that hacking is turning into one form of organised crime, one that must be prevented particularly in the international context, because it is, by its very nature, a cross-border crime. The Commission proposal to prevent attacks against information systems and for the approximation of criminal law measures taken by Member States is thus a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I want to thank our colleague, Charlotte Cederschiöld, for the valuable work she has done. I especially agree with her observation that the Union still has not enough data protection rules to deal with third pillar matters. The European Parliament on many an occasion has called for such rules to be drawn up, and I would urge the Commission to commence drafting them immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
