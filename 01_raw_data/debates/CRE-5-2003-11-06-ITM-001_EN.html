<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the ever-increasing speed at which technology advances and the increasing pressure of competition on global markets are compelling car manufacturers to adapt their production methods and also their business structures to changed conditions. It is important, in this context, that firms should learn how, at an early stage, to recognise what measures and investments are needed to secure the continuity of their economic activity, and to actually put that knowledge into practice. Restructuring, though, is often synonymous with job cuts, and frequently associated with dire consequences for the social fabric, especially in regions that have little or no potential for job creation. This is especially true of the motor vehicle industry, in which changes in production processes and the opening up of new markets have significant effects on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very well aware of how difficult this balance is and of how much citizens and workers need a minimum level of security in these difficult times. We are persuaded that dialogue at every level, founded on comprehensive and transparent information, is of the essence if they are to adapt successfully to change. The Commission has invariably acted in accordance with certain principles, which it has repeatedly emphasised. The first is that decisions on restructuring are and shall remain the prerogative and task of management. What this means is that enterprises, when planning courses of action with potentially significant social implications, are meant to actively seek out a solution that is as compatible as possible and does the least damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when redundancies cannot be avoided, everything possible must be done to enhance the employability of those affected. This will require foresight, and these procedures must be prepared in good time and managed in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if an employer neglects to fully and effectively inform and consult employee representatives in good time before publicly announcing such steps, then that can in no way be justified. Employee participation is, in every case, and especially when an enterprise is restructured, not merely a fundamental right, but also a necessary precondition if such measures are to be regarded as socially acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, we have laid down minimum rules with which all Member States and all enterprises must comply in the event of large-scale job reductions or other measures potentially affecting workers. The directives on collective redundancies, the transfer of undertakings, and European Works Councils constitute our legal framework for protecting workers’ rights and for guaranteeing fair standards for information and consultation at national and supranational level.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently, we have also enacted the Information and Consultation Directive. All these measures enable us to help Europe’s workers successfully rise to the challenges of change, by making it possible for their employability and adaptability to be developed at an early stage. The development of effective procedures for information and consultation will also be among the main elements needing to be discussed by the social partners in Europe when the Commission begins revision of the European Works Councils Directive. What is even more important is that the Commission very much hopes that Europe’s social partners will find a way to devise proven restructuring procedures throughout the EU, as they decided to do when they responded so positively in last year’s consultation on this issue. These tried and tested procedures will make for further advances in the information and consultation of workers, including, among other things, the anticipation of market trends or technological developments, as well as long-term investment in people and the encouragement of employability by the use of education and training, careers advice, alternatives to closure and redundancies, and, wherever this is possible, the redeployment within the enterprise of workers affected by restructuring measures. It is to be hoped that these procedures will help the Ford workers, too, to deal with their present difficulties. More knowledge about the future prospects of the motor vehicle industry ought to benefit all interested parties. The Commission is currently examining developments in this sector in order to identify the elements required for restructuring and the long-term competitiveness of industry in the EU. It is planning to make the results of its analysis available in about a year’s time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the most recent restructuring operations that are our immediate concern today, and I need to make it clear to you right at the outset that I share your deep regret and grave concern at the potential social consequences, for the persons concerned, of the decisions to close down plant and cut back jobs. I hope that every effort will be made, by means of a dialogue between the parties concerned, to avoid, or at least to alleviate, them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is the slump in sales, 5% since 1999 to be precise, the environmental burden against which Europe may have taken various, but insufficient, measures, as well as the powerlessness of the Member States to have any impact whatsoever on international company strategies. This is why I urgently call for a European initiative to support the further development of the industry within the context of a policy, instead of waiting passively for yet another reorganisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This European initiative should consist of a number of elements; first of all, the further development of a concept for a sustainable car. Whoever is the first to introduce this onto the market and is most advanced in this respect will achieve the highest sales figures. If China and India switch over to generalised car traffic, the environmental burden will become untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, new technological developments need support and staff. Europe must take on the competition with quality and added value as its main assets, rather than cost control. For the latter is beyond our powers! For this to happen, it will have to anticipate the ever-growing component of electronics in the added value of a car.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, large-scale reorganisations have a social dimension. By 2006, the next programme of structural funds must be approved. I hope that the Commission, during the revision of the European structural funds, particularly in the light of Limburg, will inject more resources into providing support during far-reaching industrial transformations.</p>
<p class="contents">Following that, there is something to which you have already alluded, namely the issue of the Renault Directive. It must be evaluated as an absolute measure. People on the ground tell me that the procedure established would lead to the mechanical application of the directive. Employers are so frightened of making a procedural mistake that consultation is actually prevented from the word go. We should therefore evaluate this directive as an absolute priority. These are only a few initiatives; there are still many more around which Europe could work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is not all doom and gloom in Belgium's car industry: Volvo, Opel and Volkswagen are continuing to invest and Ford has decided to further develop the new Mondeo in Genk. In principle, we should not fear the relocation of the European, and hence the Belgian, car industry. After all, the products involved are highly technological with an ever increasing knowledge component, the end production of which will take place ever more closely to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I truly hope that it will be possible to develop a policy for industries for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that there is no getting away from this and that every investment in technology results in the loss of between 9% and 25% of jobs. We must indeed find the means to counteract this loss of jobs, which occurs as a result of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to hear the Commission’s statements to the effect that we had minimum rules for workers’ rights. Such a statement is, of course, no use whatever to the workers in Genk. I hope, though, that the Commission will remember this statement when it amends the European Works Councils Directive, as it is shortly to do, and will at last take account of something that has, in some places, become common practice, that is, making the European Works Council responsible when European mainstream issues are under discussion in a firm, and will also extend the rights of information and consultation in such a way that rights of participation – and I am not talking about consultation, but about participation – are built in. Thirdly, it is essential that the Commission should learn how, in the social dialogue, to make it clear to the social partners that they have to expect penalties for failing to abide by these agreed ground rules, or else such rules will become a joke. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have resulted in nothing short of tragedies, both on a personal level and for the region. This has forced us to examine not only the role of the automobile industry, but also the role of industry as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner when he states that a company must be able to reach its decisions independently, but I think that companies should also deliver on their promises. If they claim at some stage that investments will be made, then they cannot simply delay these investments, because that is very detrimental to both their workers and the authorities of the region where they are active.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies require from the government a stable business climate. I think that we can also ask companies to aim for the highest possible level of stability and transparency: why do they take certain measures and why do they take them at a certain location and not at others? The implications for a region can be very serious indeed and, as Mrs Smet mentioned a moment ago, I think that when we revisit the structural funds, we should, for example, also look at what we can do for the Limburg region. This is, after all, a very badly hit region, which, in fact, also has a very painful history on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">We could list a whole host of things. In any case, people say that in the next couple of years, there will be further cutbacks in employment in industry. I think that if you, Commissioner, were to examine the state of the automobile industry, this might be a little late, and if you were to focus on the automobile industry alone, that this might be a little restricted, that you should take a much broader view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often said that we are heading towards a service economy, but I take the view that a service economy without an industrial basis is a very precarious matter, because products and marketing go hand in hand, and the same applies to services. Should we not, therefore, closely examine the developments within the industrial market and the link with the service industry as a matter of urgency? In that way, the European Union does not lose its industry and can match it with a very strong and better manned service industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, we have previous experience of a situation in which an industry saw its employment dwindle, namely in agriculture, an example with which you, Commissioner, are very familiar. Despite all the measures that we took in that sector – democratic staffing, subsidies, and so on – we have not been able to prevent employment from going down. Let us therefore take a more sensible and global approach this time round than we did then with regard to agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They simply reflect, I believe, the current business philosophy of global enterprises. Collective redundancies are almost invariably a means of compensating for the reduction of profits as a result of diminished demand, a purely managerial and, I might add, unimaginative approach which the economic order must, as a matter of policy, counteract if increased demand is to be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at current policy, one can see that the cutbacks that are made in all areas of society do not stoke up demand, but, on the contrary, stifle it still further. One particular demonstration of the truth that management can secure employment strategies by means other than collective redundancies is to be found in the motor industry, in the works contracts at VW or, most recently, at Opel, which reduce working time to thirty hours and thus share out the work among more people.</p>
<p class="contents">If current reports in the media are to be believed, though, it is evident that other, politically motivated considerations are involved in what is going on in Genk. According to these reports, at any rate, Ford is concentrating collective redundancies on locations – of which Genk is one and Cologne another – in those countries that did not acquiesce in US policy in the war on Iraq. The reason why the debate in this House today is so important is that the planned redundancies are not in line with Parliament’s resolution on the social consequences of industrial conversion – not in the way they have been thought out and not in the manner in which they are being put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Let the Commission re-examine how the rules have been complied with. Redundancies on this scale are anything other than a milestone on the way to fulfilling the Lisbon Agenda and result in devastating upheavals in the regions concerned. If we really want not only to become the strongest region in economic terms by 2012, but also, as was stated at Lisbon, to create full employment, then the Commission, too, has to go about things in an entirely different way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In times of crisis, we need to handle these crisis situations intelligently, which we have not done in the past. In Belgium, we had the tragic case of Renault, the closure of the factory in Vilvoorde, now Ford Genk, and there are also other cases. However, there are also examples of a better approach: at Opel in Germany, for example, people have opted for a shorter working week of thirty hours. This is a method that we Europeans should defend and spread as an example for other factories.

Today, with the drastic streamlining measures at the Ford Genk factories, Flanders is yet again facing a tragedy in the car-manufacturing sector. Although I hope that Mrs Smet’s optimism will prove to be justified, many people fear that the dismissal of 3 000 workers in Genk is simply heralding the factory's final closure and relocation. You sometimes hear fatalists claim that, due to increasing globalisation, nobody can prevent these relocations, but we should still maintain that the Belgian Government has a massive responsibility in this area. Commissioner, the truth is that the Belgian Government has known since January 2002 that the Genk car manufacturer was in serious trouble. After all, different media, including the weekly magazine <span class="italic">Knack</span>, have also reminded us that Flemish managers warned the Belgian Government that Belgium, and thus Flemish industry – which is already being weighed down by excessive labour costs – has been placed in a bad light in the United States. Many people in Flanders suspect that the ill-considered action by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, may have played a part in the decision of the Ford management to streamline the Genk assembly works.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to avoid tragedies of the kind that have unfolded in Vilvoorde and Ford Genk in future, far-reaching measures will need to be taken across all EU Member States in order to guarantee to industry, too, the <span class="italic">préférence communautaire</span>, Community preference, which has, quite rightly, been applied in agriculture for decades. If they are not, a region like Flanders should be able to outline socio-economic policy of its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to say to colleagues from Limburg that we have had that experience and we now have a thriving automotive industry in the United Kingdom; we have more international car manufacturers assembling cars in the United Kingdom than any other country in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If colleagues from Limburg would like to come and talk to me about our experience in the West Midlands, we can show you the programmes we have put in place, not just to retrain and redeploy people, but also to help those smaller companies in the supply chain affected by changes in production. So please colleagues, do not be overly depressed about it, there are ways forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we are having our debate today in the context of the future of the automotive industry because the issues surrounding the decision that Ford was forced to make at Genk go to the heart of our thinking on how we need to secure a long-term sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe, the technology and the jobs that go with it, and I and many colleagues here have a huge interest in that.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the car companies will continue to make and must make huge investments in the next generation of lighter and more fuel-efficient cars that we want, and our colleague from the Green Party made that point earlier; but those investments will come from profits – there is not going to be any state subsidy for those – and what we want are profitable car companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to give you an important figure which relates to the Genk issue. 70% of the world's car industry's profits are generated in the United States market because that is where they sell larger cars. The reason for the lay-offs at Genk is because demand for one of Ford’s largest models has fallen off dramatically. Ford has announced that it is going to make the next generation Ford Mondeo at Genk and our job is to ensure that we have a demand for that car.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion for you, Commissioner, is that we want joined-up policy. If your colleagues in DG Environment continue to press the industry to make smaller, lighter cars without any commercial regard for what is going on, then we will be back here again. If we have joined-up policy-making, however, we will have a long-term, sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">I do not think that I have to convince anyone of the fact that this is a real tragedy, not only for the people at Ford Genk, but also for the suppliers and for the region as a whole. However, Commissioner, the way in which this reorganisation is being managed is shocking, and in my view, contravenes European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that Ford has been in breach of contract on two occasions, the first time by failing to comply with the collective labour agreements that were concluded with the workers in 2002, and in which investments were planned. The second case, Commissioner, is, however, for Europe to deal with, as it has to do with a failure to consult the European Works Council in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The reorganisation at Ford is clearly a European matter, because the cancellation of investments at Ford Genk has repercussions for two other establishments in Germany. Moreover, jobs have also been scrapped in Cologne and the Jaguar factory in Barnsley is being closed down. This clearly illustrates, therefore, that this reorganisation is a European matter that should be dealt with by the European works council. However, as it happens, Commissioner, the works council was not consulted in this matter. Ford is deliberately entering into negotiations on a company-by-company basis. This, in my view, clearly contravenes legislation concerning the European works council for which we voted here in 1994. After all, no attempt whatsoever is currently being made to find a solution for this reorganisation at European level. As my fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this could have yielded alternative solutions, for example, by spreading the work among various people in, for example, the framework of a shorter working week.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question to the Commission is whether it intends, on the basis of European legislation on European works councils, to require that the Ford management start negotiations within a European framework at this stage. A second question on this subject, Commissioner, concerns the following. The regulation concerning Ford's European works council is apparently based on the notorious Article 13, the so-called voluntary agreements, to which the directive and annex with minimum provisions do not apply. Would this not yet again constitute a reason for the Commission to impose these famous minimum rules on all agreements concerning European works councils? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, Catalonia, this sector saw 31 so-called social plans – <span class="italic">expedients de regulació</span>, in Catalan – in 2001-2002, as a result of which 5 200 employees were made redundant. The closures of companies manufacturing automobile components, such as Lear and Valeo which have shut up shop, are deeply shocking for my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p class="contents">One does not have to be an expert to understand that competition with Eastern European countries is now unviable. Automobile companies, and others, are relocating because, over there, the costs of skilled labour are much lower than ours and, in this area, our companies cannot compete. If, some day, these countries succeed in genuinely converging with our own, companies will relocate still further to the east, outside the EU, following the cold logic of the market economy. We are told that, in order to avoid such evils, greater flexibility in the employment market is required. Greater flexibility means fewer guarantees for workers and, hence, less social cohesion. For all those who believe in the European social model, that is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Italy is a country that is home to a large automobile manufacturer, which is Italian and which has restructuring policies that it implements, of necessity, in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is, as has been said, that the automobile market is a mature market; automobile production has shifted, little by little, to many countries, in particular countries in the Far East, and there are probably lots of Members who have bought Korean, Japanese or even Indian cars.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is that firms need to be restructured because the market changes and greater competitiveness is needed in the sector. I do not think that it will help us to discuss the choices made by individual firms; in my view, these choices should be left to the firms themselves, for the sake of competitiveness of the system and long-term employment: there is no point thinking that you can sustain employment today when there is a risk of losing it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done is to guarantee a great deal more than the institutions do today; a lot more than the European Commission – which currently assigns its budget to agriculture and declining sectors and not into innovative sectors – has done to date; to insist on the quality of the workforce in general, on training and on technological innovation. We need employment and we cannot expect it to come from declining sectors that need to be restructured. We must create the conditions for the workforce to be in the sectors of the future and not those of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For what was the case at Renault? It is true that the provisions with regard to the European and national works councils were completely ignored. That was the big problem. It was, above all, an issue between the workers and the company. Here, we have, in fact, another problem. There is, of course, also a problem between the Belgian Government and the company. That is the crux of the problem and, in my view, there are two or three reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is, I fear, the very complex system of Belgian social security. It is simply the case in Belgium that, relatively speaking, the whole surreal business is funded by social security to a far greater extent than in other countries, but that, of course, leads to a bad competitive position compared to those other countries. It is not, however, for Ford to solve this; it is a task for the Belgian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason, of course, why matters have been brought to a head, is that it has taken far too long to comply with Ford's requests to do something about the shift bonus. Then it suddenly transpired that the German companies were more competitive, although wages there are higher than in Belgium. Who then is to blame, is it the workers? No, it is the Belgian Government. The Belgian Government should take responsibility for this and should prevent this from happening again. This, I believe, is the main conclusion that we can draw from this.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are problems with legislation, it is fortunate that there is a directive, so they should refer to it and start legal proceedings. In the case of Renault, it has transpired that this can have a positive outcome. That is the method, but we must in this matter look for a solution that is different from that in the case of Renault. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the European Works Councils Directive, I can explain it to anyone, as I was its originator. I was myself chairman of the works council of Ford Europe for six years. I would recommend waiting to see what comes out of the discussions between the trade unions and the European Works Council, as I am sure that Ford Genk will get compensation for what it was promised in the collective labour agreement.

<p class="contents">The Commission has told this House that it will carry out a study into the future of the sector. Even though, of course, studies have already been carried out and their results have been made available, I am surprised that the Commission has announced that it still intends to go ahead with this. In Belgium, however, there are economists who claim that employment in the western European car assembly sector is set to halve within the foreseeable future, because the potential market is unable to follow increased productivity. Similar predictions are being made for other sectors in industry. Assuming that the Commission has collated some research material of its own, I should like to ask it whether it shares these gloomy expectations. I hope that they are a little less gloomy, but industry is in any case facing a few changes. I should like to ask the Commissioner whether it is not necessary after all for the government to provide some support while industry is going through this transition. The social partners should definitely be involved as well. In my view, however, the government has a role to play here, as do the European authorities, which certainly have a coordinating task.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another two specific questions. Reference has been made to the Structural Funds, and to the fact that they will be subject to a review in 2006. The current programming periods are still running. I have asked the Commission what scope the Structural Funds could offer Limburg at this stage. I was told that there is still a percentage of 4% in reserve that can be tapped into at any time. My question is whether, further to the problems at Ford Genk, the Flemish Government has asked the Commission to tap into those 4% or whether it has been silent on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say the following. This issue has naturally been discussed in the Belgian Parliament, and the Finance Minister has stated there that he would contact the European authorities to see whether it would be possible to join forces again with 'conversion partnerships'. These are partnerships that receive certain fiscal benefits during a certain period of time. On that front too, I should like to find out from the Commission whether or not the Belgian Government has been in touch to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will pass them all on to the Commissioner responsible so that they may be carefully examined. I mentioned most of the points that have been made in my opening remarks, and I do not therefore wish to repeat them.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be general consensus as to how to deal with the crises resulting from the need to adapt and from industrial change and restructuring. Let me reiterate one thing, and do so clearly. Effective, timely and comprehensive information for, and consultation with, workers’ representatives constitutes a key element in our response to situations such as these. Another important element in this context will be following up the ongoing consultation with the social partners on the restructuring of enterprises. I am sure that you all understand how necessary it is to identify good practice for this, at European level, and, where necessary, to develop it further.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to Mrs Van Lancker’s and Mr Kuckelkorn’s discussion, I would like to point out that the Commission has not, to date, received any complaint from the responsible workers’ representatives in relation to this matter. Moreover, if the directive in question has indeed been breached, then that is a case for the Belgian courts; it is they who must then consider the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already announced, though, we will in any case be launching a revision of the directive. Nor must we overlook the fact that, while changes in industry have economic effects and consequences for employment and social cohesion, they can also offer opportunities, especially when they are anticipated, prepared for and managed. In relation to this, Mrs Weiler, you mentioned the need to make a financial request or to examine the possibility of applying structural funds for this purpose – my experts here tell me that no such application has as yet been made to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue, transparency, genuine worker participation, foresight, risk avoidance and the encouragement of employability – such are the key elements in a European response to all these occurrences. Let us all work at them and do our utmost to create the instruments – whether legal acts or in some other form – to further develop these concepts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I am grateful to you for being here and congratulate you on everything you do for agriculture, I have to say that, normally speaking, a Commissioner should be here for industrial policy and social policy who can reply to the questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
