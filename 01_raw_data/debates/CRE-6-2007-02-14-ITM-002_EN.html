<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giovanni Claudio Fava (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after a year’s work, more than 200 hearings, seven missions abroad and thousands of pages and documents examined, what I am presenting to Parliament this morning is not just the final report on the work of our committee, but a rigorous analysis of five years of excesses and abuses, often tolerated for the sake of the fight against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against terrorism is an enterprise to which we are all committed without exception, but we never agreed that the founding principles of our Treaties should be trampled underfoot for the sake of this enterprise. Thus we come to the subject of our mandate: extraordinary renditions. Did our governments know about them? Some of them certainly did. Those governments that decided to send their agents to interrogate the victims of the renditions in Guantánamo, Syria and Afghanistan – they knew. The European embassies in Sarajevo knew what would happen to the Algerians who were captured and handed over to the Americans against the orders of the local courts to set them free. The top people in SISMI, Italy’s military intelligence service, knew that the CIA was preparing a kidnapping on Italian soil.</p>
<p class="contents">There is widespread responsibility and contributory negligence surrounding these events, and very few European countries are entirely blameless. This is demonstrated by the facts we have gathered, Mr President: not opinions or prejudices, but circumstantiated, concrete, serious, proven, verified facts. The facts also include the unanswered questions, contradictions and omissions that we have gathered. In the face of all this evidence, if people decide to look the other way, it will be because they lack the courage to stand up for what is right or they have no intellectual honesty.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost every day, Mr Gawronski asks me whether we have found out anything new in the last few months. Yes, Mr Gawronski, a lot. We have found out that there are many more than the 21 rendition cases that we have reconstructed: they are faceless, nameless prisoners, without anybody who will complain about their fate, because they do not have a western passport in their pocket. We have found out that one man is innocent: he may have to stay in Guantánamo for almost five years, stripped of the most basic rights, just because no government is interested in getting him out. We have found out that torture is pointless in the fight against terrorism: that was explained to us by Maher Arar, the innocent victim of a rendition, who was held and tortured in Syria for 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">We discovered that and other things because Mura Kurnaz and Maher Arar were our witnesses: we had asked for them to be brought before our committee under escort, and we questioned them at length, as we did many others, including victims, relatives, lawyers and magistrates. We conducted 200 hearings, Mr President, a showcase of hurt and humiliated human beings. Should we now pretend nothing has happened and look the other way, as many European governments have done? Some people, of course, would have preferred us to use more accommodating, more cautious language, perhaps in the belief that the abuses, infringements and excesses are the normal price to pay in the fight against terrorism. That is a fallacy. The strength of our principles lies in the rigour with which we can apply them, starting with the report that we are debating this morning. It is Parliament’s duty, Mr President, to show that it is not caught up in the game of expediency and political affiliations. When faced with the truth, we each represent not a government or a party, but rather our own selves, our individual moral honesty, and our integrity as human beings and as MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, above all I should like to thank the committee chairman, Mr Coelho, for the balanced way in which he directed our work throughout the year. I should also like to thank all the staff and assistants and the Members who have lavished particular care and passion on this work. This page in Parliament’s history that is being written today is first and foremost the outcome of this shared passion for the public good. We expect the same rigour and, if I may say so, the same consistency from the Council and the Commission. We have opened a door, and we shall not allow anyone to close it again. Above and beyond this report, we have a duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the events of the last five years can never happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In July last year, my predecessor Mrs Lehtomäki stood where I am standing now and, speaking on behalf of the Finnish Presidency in the debate on the interim report from the temporary committee on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, stressed that – and I quote, ‘All action taken against terrorism must be in compliance with obligations under international law, and no compromises on these, where it concerns human rights, refugee or humanitarian issues, can be accepted in the name of action against terrorism.’ There has been no change in the Council’s position on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s foreign ministers have expressed this principle also in dialogues with other states, whilst, in dialogue with our American friends, we have, in addition, made clear our concern about the situation in Guantanamo and urged the USA to close the prison camp there without further ado.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP and Council Secretary-General, also stated his position on this when he was interviewed by the committee, stressing that the EU had always, in its dealings with the USA, based its arguments on the importance of the values we share, which are to be upheld in the fight against terrorism. It follows that the Council has already, for some time, been doing what the report calls for in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the temporary committee on the alleged use of European states by the CIA for the purposes of transporting and illegally detaining prisoners, together with the Council of Europe’s investigations, have raised a number of important issues and heightened awareness of the importance of human rights. The committee’s hearings, its interim report and this draft final report, have their counterparts in a number of Member States, where this matter has been the subject of parliamentary and judicial inquiries, many of which have not been concluded. Such is the case with the inquiries being carried out in my own country, where a committee of its parliament is considering issues raised by your own.</p>
<p class="contents">Inquiries of this kind have in fact been called for in your report, and, with the subsidiarity principle in mind, this strikes me as the right level at which they should be held.</p>
<p class="contents">My reason for saying that is that, in many areas investigated by the committee, the European Union itself has no power to act, and I am thinking here in particular of the monitoring of the intelligence services. This is something that the Council, represented by Mrs Lehtomäki and by its High Representative Mr Solana, has had more than one occasion to point out to your House and to the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">You may well find that cause for regret, but the fact of the matter is that the treaties as they stand limit the Council's scope for action in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore appears to me that the report’s reprimand to the Council for having allegedly failed to cooperate sufficiently with the Temporary Committee is not, in the final analysis, justifiable in view of the fact that both the Finnish and German Presidencies took part in plenary debates on the interim and final reports, and that Mr Solana and the EU’s anti-terrorism coordinator, Mr de Vries, took up the temporary committee’s invitations to appear before it, where they, as they were instructed to do, answered all its questions.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that I am unable, in this intervention, to discuss specific points in the report, for, firstly, I have no desire to pre-empt the various amendments that have been tabled, and, secondly, as regards the sections dealing with individual Member States, it is only right that the Presidency should abide by established custom and refrain from commenting in public on matters that are reserved to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The temporary committee has, as a rule, arrived at its conclusions – some of which are far-reaching – and made its critical comments on individual cases and Member States, on the basis of publicly accessible documents and important witness statements. Assertions have a habit of turning rapidly into facts, and the Council believes that, in a number of instances, rather more cautious language would have been desirable, since no final judgment can be passed on certain of the issues discussed without comprehensive knowledge of the documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I do nevertheless think that the positions, on matters of substance, of Parliament and the Council are not as distant from each other as this draft report might lead one to surmise, and I am persuaded that all the EU institutions act on the basis of the same shared and inalienable values. In any case, the Council will continue to respect fundamental human rights and actively defend them both at home and abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the horrendous terrorist attacks around the world, security has become an essential right of citizens, so that we can all live in a world of freedoms and rights. Although security is undeniably one of the fundamental rights of citizens and enables us to exercise our freedoms, we must never forget – as I have often said before in this Chamber – that legality is an essential condition for guaranteeing the citizens’ right to security. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have and cannot ever have security at just any price. Since these are our values, we must not be afraid or ashamed to address this subject here in this Chamber. It is a subject that we have sought to clarify and explain by means of Parliament’s work and the contributions that many of us have made.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must never forget that seeking the truth under the rule of law is based on identifying specific facts, which free and independent judges are then asked to investigate. It has been the duty of the national enquiries to ascertain the truth behind the pointers, allegations and facts, and to ensure that those responsible for any breach of the law are punished. There is no doubt that there are guilty parties, but it is not the job of the European institutions, Parliament or the Commission to hand down judgments, but rather to call for the truth to be ascertained. Clearly, the truth that emerges from the enquiries conducted under the rule of law may well result in fallout at both institutional and political levels.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud Parliament’s investigation for having come up with a number of facts that will be useful in pursuing the enquiries, as the rapporteur, Mr Fava, has just said. Thus it is the job of the judges to investigate and the job of governments – both those who have already done so and those who have not – to conduct administrative enquiries and to punish disloyal officials, because officials who break the law under cover of secrecy betray both their institutions and the State, and are therefore disloyal officials. In any case, once the facts have finally been established, governments have a duty to reveal the truth, however awkward and unpleasant it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s role has been to help Parliament in its work by providing specific pieces of information, which have proved useful in Parliament’s investigations. Once the truth of the matter has emerged, if it ever does, the Commission’s role will also involve drawing conclusions from the results of the enquiries and at that point formulating proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that parliaments and politics have a further job, ladies and gentlemen, which is above all to look to the future and suggest solutions to ensure that such events can never happen again. I am sure that everyone who has worked hard on this investigation has done so mainly to further the aim of achieving security within the law, and to advance security as a right. Security has not been just optional ever since 11 September 2001: it has been a fundamental right. I trust that everyone who has worked on this aspect is willing to continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to think carefully about the role of the secret services. The President-in-Office of the Council has rightly said that we cannot have a European law on secret services, but we do need to organise some political reflection on their role. I am deeply convinced that these bodies are essential in combating terrorism, but governments must accept full responsibility for their operations and give them a clear and precise mandate. Rules are therefore needed at a national level: reforms are indeed under way in many Member States, including my own country. There is, however, one aspect on which I believe Parliament could usefully send out a message, which is that intelligence and security services – or secret services, as they are commonly called – should be subject to stricter parliamentary control, not to reveal their secret activities, which are essential in the fight against terrorism, but to report on the overall balance of their activities, in other words on what has been done as a result of the intelligence gathered. The idea, therefore, is not to disclose any secret information, but to examine in general terms the balance of their activities. After all, these bodies need to be supported, not discredited as if they were criminal organisations. Even so, I think it is essential for parliaments to exercise political control over them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other aspects that deserve some thought at European level, particularly the use of airspace. Ladies and gentlemen, the use of airspace is one of the points highlighted by the Fava report. How can State aircraft – that is, those used in the service of the State – be classified? How can we distinguish them from civil aircraft? The Commission can make a contribution on this point, because our air traffic responsibilities may help in defining more reliable criteria for determining whether an aircraft is being used legitimately and for preventing abuse of the cover provided by a State aircraft when it is being used for purposes other than State service. That is a practical contribution that we can make.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to put forward some purely political ideas. I think it would be a political mistake to give the impression that we are pointing the finger at the United States, although that is not the rapporteur’s stated intention. It would be a political mistake that I, quite frankly, would certainly not endorse. Instead, we should make it quite clear, first of all, that the ones in the wrong are the terrorists: in other words, the ones who have broken the law and are once again prepared to attack our democratic institutions. I am saying this because we must all realise that this murky affair, which is certainly full of irregularities, came to light precisely because of the great US democracy and its free press. Because of them, events began to be disclosed in the United States that have since been investigated by the European Parliament and other institutions, including the courts. You are all perfectly aware that the US Congress is still dealing with this affair, and that we intend to work hand in hand with the German Presidency throughout its period in office in order to revive Euro-Atlantic cooperation, on the basis of the two inseparable pillars of security and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we shall continue to seek the truth and, as is our duty, to collaborate with the United States as sincere allies, who tell the truth even when it is an awkward truth, and who call for those responsible for any irregularities to be punished. To conclude, please allow me to point out that, if Parliament is divided today on this very sensitive issue, it will weaken the message that you send out. If, however, you are united in giving out a firm message, on the one hand, and in reviving collaboration on rights and security, on the other, you will be showing how strong Parliament can be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jas Gawronski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right from the start of our work in this committee a year ago, we have tried to improve the report that is before us and to make it more balanced, more useful and more consensual. Today we have to admit that we have not succeeded. We started off on the wrong foot right at the outset: on our first visit to Washington, we presented ourselves in the State Department like a prosecuting court – I am sorry to disillusion you, Mr Frattini. Thus any dialogue that would have helped us achieve our purpose was made difficult from the very start.</p>
<p class="contents">After our visit to London, the UK Minister for Europe wrote to his European counterparts advising them against meeting us. Although we had given up any hope of improving this report, we did make a last-ditch attempt at our meeting yesterday, when we highlighted some key points in our amendments which, if not accepted, would mean that our group as a whole would vote against the report. The rapporteur has already indicated, unless he wants to change his mind, that he will not accept our key amendments, and so everything suggests that we shall be voting against it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may take off my coordinator’s hat for a moment and speak on my own behalf, I have to admit that many members of our group would vote against it even if these amendments were accepted. I personally could only vote for it if two amendments that I have tabled were adopted, as they seem to me perfectly simple, linear and acceptable. The first one states that the secret services are so called because they are secret and they must be allowed to work in secret, so long as they do not break the law. The second states that the CIA can fly whenever and however it wishes, so long as it does not break the law. If these amendments are adopted, I shall also be inclined to vote in favour. The rapporteur has rejected them. I believe that refusing to accept these amendments means that the intention behind this report is not only to identify, accuse and punish the culprits, but also to condemn the secret services as such to inefficiency by subjecting them to full accountability and exposing them to every external threat possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we do not like this report. We do not like it because it is useless. Mr Fava has said that I maintain that there is nothing new in the report. That is true: I do maintain that, and I am not the only one to do so. Someone else who thinks so is Senator Dick Marty, who was a great ally and supporter of his and was welcomed in our committee as a hero and leader. Today, however, now that your report has been finalised, Mr Fava, Dick Marty says that the document contains nothing new at all and that we have just copied what he had done previously; he says he is disappointed with the report, and the only difference compared with his one is that the document that has you as the rapporteur, Mr Fava, was drawn up by 46 Members and 13 full-time staff, whereas Dick Marty achieved the same result working alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr President, I should like to finish by emphasising that I agree with Mr Frattini: we certainly need to try to uphold human rights even in the context of the fight against terrorism. In this case, however, a document like this one is of no use, since it has already established <span class="italic">a priori</span> that there is an indisputable violator of human rights, in other words the United States, and only lines of enquiry in support of this idea are pursued.</p>

We are talking about the core values of our European Community, of which we are rightly proud and which we rightly defend in our day-to-day work, in this House, and in this lucid report.</p>
<p class="contents">International terrorism is indeed a threat to freedom and must be fought with all the means at our disposal, but this must be done on the basis of our national laws, of the European Convention on Human Rights and of international treaties such as the UN Convention against Torture. That, precisely, has been our concern in doing this work.</p>
<p class="contents">This offence against international human rights and against the very foundations of European law must be denounced and punished. What has happened to these people – who include our European fellow-citizens – is not, contrary to what certain members of the committee would have us believe, a trivial offence; no, it is inhumane, it is immoral, and it is unjust. So what actually happened to the people who were abducted, sold, handed over, detained and tortured? Who caused it to be done and who had a hand in it? That is the truth that we had to find out – not the reason why the German citizen Mr El-Masri went to Skopje, from where he was abducted, taken to Kabul and tortured, or why the Turkish citizen Murat Kurnaz, who had been born and had grown up in Bremen, took himself off to Pakistan, whence he was sold, tortured and dragged off to Guantanamo. Neither of these men had been charged with any crime; neither of them had anyone to defend them.</p>
<p class="contents">Had they been suspected of committing crimes, this would have been something for the prosecutors and the courts to decide; never before have we arrogated to ourselves this role, but there is no case in which the end justifies the means. What we do know is that CIA agents were involved in the abductions. Prosecutors in Milan and Munich have issued warrants for their arrest, which must now be passed on to the USA. We cannot, and must not, allow a secret service organisation to do as it pleases on our soil, with our governments being unable to defend themselves against it.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the German Presidency of the Council to make it plain, on behalf of all the Member States, that they will not allow illegal practices and violations of human rights on their territory. In fighting wrongdoing of whatever kind, the law must not be broken, for we would thereby be betraying nothing less than that which we have inherited from our founding fathers, the very foundation of our Community. Europe stands for the rule of law, for separation of the powers and democracy; its politicians must take their stand for those things. As Lao Tse said many years ago, one is responsible not only for that which one does, but also for that that one does not do.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do about this is also a matter of personal and political morality, and not just of jurisprudence. As I see it, the great achievement of this committee is to move this debate out into the European Union, into society and far beyond our borders. Europe must not become a stop on the road to Guantanamo.</p>

When we support this splendid report, which closes a year of hard and serious work in the committee, we will be showing a very strong concern, as great as anyone else’s, for security, and for security by all legal means, including the work of secret services, who can operate inside the law. We will be showing a concern for the legitimacy to protect our freedom and to protect the relationship with our closest allies. But we cannot support the idea that the only way to protect our freedom is through a dirty war. We do not like dirty war. That would represent – it has represented – a frontal attack on our values: what we stand for and what we preach.</p>
<p class="contents">We have gathered together here a great amount of information that proves the existence of an illegal, sometimes criminal, scheme designed to fight terrorism, operating worldwide and assisted by the passivity, if not the active cooperation, of some European Member States, of some governments or of people under their control. The Council itself cannot be excluded from criticism of such passivity. We have not acted as a court. We are a political body and what we will vote on here is a political statement based on facts: facts that have been checked, facts that have been proved and facts that anyone who reads this document will see to be true, not with the sort of truth that can be proved point by point before a court, because we did not have the means to do that. Why not? Because many of the governments involved did not help us to have those means. But the facts are there.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not inventive imagination. We have met the victims – those who could come, that is, for others are still in jail. Some are innocents in Guantánamo who were taken from their homes after being cleared by a court. So we are making a political statement and sending a message to European governments and to the Member States. We are saying to them here, on behalf of millions of European citizens: you cannot do this in our name. You cannot fight terrorism through a dirty war in our name. Do not do that in our name because you are not representing us when you fight terrorism through these means. That is the statement that this Chamber will be voting on here today. You are free to support it or not, but that is what is going to be voted on here in several hours’ time.</p>

In that time, the fears of those opposed to its formation have been justified. The committee has not been able to present any new evidence that Member States were engaged in illegal activity. It has simply compiled information on the activities of the media and Public Prosecutors in Member States. The latter have themselves taken the action required in a very few isolated cases, without any assistance from the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of hard evidence has driven the European Left to name and shame, regardless of the facts. There is an old saying that if the facts do not fit the accepted premises, so much the worse for the facts. That is the reason for the ridiculous allegations made against Mr Solana and Mr de Vries. It is also the reason for the ridiculous allegations against over half the Member States, concerning lack of control of their airspace, which is said to have resulted in individuals being thrown into torture chambers. It also accounts for the ridiculous language used in certain chapters and amendments. If all we can say, for instance, is that in Poland there is simply no evidence for or against the theory that detention centres existed in that country, it would be best to remain silent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In doing this work, the committee has also afforded us a good example of good and successful cooperation with the Council of Europe and its special investigator, Mr Dick Marty. Our common effort also, wherever possible, involved national committees of inquiry, NGOs, the media – representing the fourth estate – and sometimes also cooperation with the executive, although we were, unfortunately enough, working against it for much of the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take this opportunity to express my amazement at the way in which the Polish Government – the government of one of our Member States – treated the members of the committee like emissaries from the Warsaw Pact. It would appear that not everyone quite understands that membership of the European Union not only confers rights, but also involves the assumption of responsibilities. Those who have nothing to hide do not behave in such a fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps what our committee has come up with should also result in us doing more serious thinking about how to protect human rights within the European Union, for, after all, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>does not cease to apply once a country’s accession is accomplished. I do not doubt that there is no shortage of things to be cleared up in my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany – the case of Abu Zammar, for example, in which it is evident that information supplied by the German authorities to the American secret services resulted in his abduction from Casablanca, in Morocco, and his rendition to Syria, where he was confined to a torture prison and interrogated by, among others, the German secret services. I would also remind you of the El-Masri case, which came to the committee’s attention; both Mr El-Masri and his lawyer are still waiting for an apology from the USA, and light still needs to be shed on the role of the former interior minister of the Federal Republic of Germany in it. Finally, I would also ask you to recall the case of Murat Kurnaz, whom the committee also interviewed. His lawyer has made serious accusations of mistreatment by members of the German armed forces in Afghanistan, and also of what appears to be the prevention of his earlier release, and I do not doubt that our counterparts in the German parliament will be investigating them. What one can say with certainty, though, is that neither the present German Government nor its predecessor have shown a great deal of empathy with him.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these cases, I am confident that the Members of the <span class="italic">Bundestag </span>will do what they have to do with great care. The case that certainly had a particular impact on our committee was that of Maher Arar from Canada, which clearly showed how little security is enhanced by statements extracted under torture, and I am very glad to hear that he has been promised compensation. I do wonder, though, just what this compensation will do to restore to him the rights and the physical health he has lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequences must also be drawn as regards those detainees who still remain in Guantanamo Bay, the Uigurs, Uzbeks and Saudi Arabians who cannot return to their countries because those countries do not recognise human rights. This is where we, in the European Union, have the chance to make our contribution by affirming that we have understood, that we are ready to learn from the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, this is not an exercise in anti-Americanism or in naivety in the fight against terrorism. Put simply and bluntly, this is about the values shared on both sides of the Atlantic, among which are democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament has very carefully pieced together the last few years of the perverse US strategy in the war against terrorism, which was based on the use of criminal methods and violations of human rights. It was only possible to implement this strategy because of the collusion of European governments and secret services. Condoleezza Rice even said so herself: ‘There has been no violation of national sovereignty.’ Some of the responsibility must also be laid at the door of the European institutions, starting with the remissness of Javier Solana and Gijs De Vries. In my view, however, we must also highlight the embarrassing silence by the President of the Commission, who was perfectly aware of US strategy while he was the Prime Minister of Portugal, to the extent that he organised the famous Azores Summit just five days before the start of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that another point needs to be stressed: the Vice-President of the Commission stated in this Chamber that he knew nothing about the kidnapping of Abu Omar, which occurred while he was Foreign Minister in Italy. I believed him then and I believe him now, but a new fact has come up in the meantime which, I think, can help clarify matters: Admiral Battelli, the former head of the SISMI, has admitted that the CIA gave him a list of 13 alleged terrorists to keep under surveillance, including Abu Omar. The head of the SISMI must, by law, report to the government, and at that time Commissioner Frattini was the Italian Government minister responsible for the secret services.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, the work that we have done has enabled us to bring a good number of facts to light, although there still remain others to investigate. We are confident that today’s vote will be useful in future, not only to say ‘Never again’, but also in discovering who else may be responsible. A great Roman historian once said, ‘They make a desert and call it peace.’ We think that peace is built by avoiding the desert, in other words by avoiding the death of the rule of law for the sake of the false fight against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me say at the outset that, contrary to many committee members as well as the rapporteur and the Italian party that he represents, my party, the <span class="italic">Fiamma tricolore</span>, and I myself believe that Europe ought to be playing a different geopolitical role and, again contrary to what Mr Fava represents, I believe that the Atlantic Alliance is an outdated instrument, because it gives Europe a subordinate role. I would therefore have ideological reasons for criticising the activities – any kind of activities in general – carried out by the CIA or any other organisation operating on behalf of the United States and NATO inside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe I am also being balanced and objective in decisively rejecting the conclusions of the Fava report, because not only is it flawed by its fundamental hypocrisy, in that it calls into question the operations of a State that is recognised and accepted as an ally, but it is tendentious and adds nothing new beyond what has already appeared in a number of newspapers. Of course, any violation of human rights is abhorrent and intolerable and must be rejected, but to insist on a presumption of innocence in secret service operations is laughable and could even be dangerous if its purpose is to protect the people and the State. The need for such protection is another reason why we cannot vote for the Fava report, unless many of the tabled amendments are accepted, particularly those by Mr Pirilli and Mr Gawronski. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council of Europe, under Swiss Senator Dick Marty, produced a report on extraordinary rendition, so the European Parliament had to do one as well.</p>
<p class="contents">A British Government minister said that the Marty report was ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’, and the Fava report is not much better. As Senator Marty has said, we, with enormously greater resources, have produced little solid material in addition to his own report. We have assembled a great number of press cuttings. We have collected flight information obsessively, with enormous lists of aircraft movements, and we are told that these aircraft <span class="italic">may</span> have been owned by companies that <span class="italic">may</span> have some connection with the CIA. However, we have no idea who or what was on these flights.</p>
<p class="contents">All the way through our work we have sought to conflate flights with renditions. We have simply assumed that CIA flights equate with extrajudicial rendition of suspects. However, the CIA may have all sorts of legitimate reasons to move people and materiel around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We went to Washington determined that senior US politicians should be made to confess their guilt, but we were met by a robust response. The US Administration admits that a few renditions took place in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but far fewer than we wanted to see.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard allegations from a number of people who claimed to have been subject to rendition, but with little supporting evidence. We went, at great expense, to Macedonia, but all we learned was that Macedonian hotels and border posts keep rather poor records.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that our whole exercise was designed to provide a platform for anti-American propaganda. We should all be ashamed of the deep undercurrent of anti-Americanism in this House. The Fava report is its latest manifestation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it was not enough to attack the US: we attacked Member State governments as well, accusing them of collusion with American security services. For my part, I should be concerned if European governments did <span class="italic">not</span> cooperate with the US in the war on terror.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the virulent attack on my constituent, the British minister Geoff Hoon, by our committee Vice-Chairwoman Baroness Ludford, breached the norms of courteous political discourse and stands as a reproach to our House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to insist on human rights and humane treatment for terrorist suspects, but we cannot expect either European or American security services to operate under constant scrutiny amounting to harassment from MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">This report will do little to promote human rights. What it will do is to give comfort and encouragement to the very terrorists who intend to destroy our way of life. If we approve this report, they will know that we are more concerned about the comfort of terrorist suspects than about the safety of the people we represent.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carlos Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have five comments to make. The first is to thank the following people: Mr Fava for his high-quality report, and for all his efforts over the year in putting together this report; the committee vice-chairmen, Baroness Ludford, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Özdemir, for the close cooperation we enjoyed; the coordinators of the political groups and the members of the committee I chaired, as the report that has been submitted is also the result of their efforts; and the services that assisted us, for the very high quality of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that Parliament is fulfilling its role. There are those who would downplay or hide this issue, because it could be embarrassing to our allies. We have not done that. We have asserted our values. As Mr Frattini stated in the Chamber today, security cannot be at any price and therein lies the difference, not simply because they are our values but because, when we do not do so, innocent people always suffer. That happened in this case Our committee received some of the victims and heard their testimonies. I am appalled by the cynical attitude of those who feel that these wrongs are inevitable and that we should consider them collateral damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have done our job without extending our mandate. We have not, as some would have liked, artificially extended our mandate in order to engage in political combat. We have assessed the facts, identified wrongdoing, pointed out omissions and tabled more than 40 recommendations to make it much more difficult for these things to happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we could have achieved more, and would have if we had received more cooperation. I wish to single out and thank the Commission for its outstanding help, and specifically Mr Frattini. Unfortunately, most Member States did not cooperate with us very effectively. For example, of the countries at the centre of the allegations of secret detention centres, Romania was extremely helpful, but cooperation from Poland was very poor. The latter was the only country in which not one government minister or member of parliament met with us. It is my understanding that this reinforces the suspicions falling on these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also condemn the lack of cooperation from the Council, which sent us truncated, incomplete documents, passing them off as authentic and original. This is unacceptable under the principle of close collaboration between the institutions. Mr President, I feel that improvements can and should be made to our report, but there is an issue of political responsibility with which we have to contend. Are we or are we not going to defend our values and our citizens? I believe that some in this House were genuinely convinced that these allegations were false and that nothing had happened, that is to say, there had been no secret detention centres, no torture, no extraordinary rendition and no illegal detention of prisoners. Yet in our committee we received various witnesses, and via the newspapers came the main witness, the President of the United States of America, who eventually acknowledged the existence of the extraordinary rendition programme. There is no longer any room to rebut the facts or deny the evidence. The time has come to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by saying that transatlantic dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual interest must be stepped up with respect for our values, for our laws and for international law. That is what is at stake here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Temporary Committee’s final report deals with issues of fundamental importance to the citizens of the European Union. I speak as a former political prisoner myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say the following to the opponents of this report, to those who have subjected the work we have been involved in for over a year to derisory attacks. Party loyalties or ideological differences on many issues may divide all those who support this report. We are, however, united in the conviction that secret service agents must act within the law, and that nobody may be tortured or deprived of his or her dignity. This is currently the main political divide in the House. Is one in favour of <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> or of granting the secret service a free rein? Is one in favour of secret isolation and detention centres or of the rule of law? Is one for or against the use of torture?</p>
<p class="contents">Many European governments and institutions have not made the necessary efforts to clarify the issues raised by the committee. I particularly regret the lack of serious cooperation on the part of the Polish Government, despite the fact that aircraft operated by the CIA made 11 stopovers at Polish airports in the context of extraordinary renditions. Polish Government representatives claim that there were no secret CIA detention centres in Poland. In my opinion, however, on the basis of the material gathered, and in view of the fact that no independent investigation into this matter has been conducted in Poland, the committee is not in a position to categorically exclude the existence of such centres on Polish territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European Commission President Barroso, who of course comes from the PPE-DE Group, the centre-right, wants the themes of accountability and promoting Europe’s values in the world to figure alongside security in the Berlin Declaration marking the EU’s 50th birthday in March.</p>
<p class="contents">This serious and professional report, for which I thank Mr Fava, the committee chairman Mr Coelho and all the staff, is about accountability for human rights abuses which European governments did collude in or allowed to happen on their territory. It is about security, but built within a framework of law in which the security not to end up as a tortured ghost detainee counts too and it is certainly about promoting Europe’s values in the world, the ones of democracy, human rights and the rule of law to which Member States signed up in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, speaking at the recent Munich Security Conference about the West’s defeat of totalitarianism in the 20th century and our opposition to extremist ideologies now. He said: ‘Our most effective weapon, then and now, has been Europe’s and North America’s shared belief in political and economic freedom, religious toleration, human rights, representative government and the rule of law. Those values kept our side united’. Indeed, so why has the Bush Administration – not Americans as a whole – tossed away the moral high ground and dragged America’s reputation into the mud by a programme of kidnapping, forced disappearance, dark prisons, indefinite detention, cruel and inhuman treatment and outsourcing of torture? As Barack Obama has said, what the US needs is not to be feared, but to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not rejoice in the fact that the latest survey of global opinion finds an antagonism to America at an intense pitch. Even in Poland, fewer than four out of ten have a mainly positive view of the US.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has failed a test in the last five years, a test of whether it will practise its values or only preach them. We have lacked the guts to refuse to collude with torture flights and lacked the vision to use Europe’s capacity to be a real and united best friend to America, and it is about time that we actually practised those values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Instead of being presented with facts, we have been treated to verbiage comprising expressions such as ‘pays tribute’, ‘thanks’, ‘expresses its concern’, and ‘denounces’.

The British, Irish, Austrian, Italian, Greek, Danish, Romanian and Polish Governments are mentioned by name in this negative context. The report is unreliable and tendentious. It puts forward opinions selected to fit in with the anti-American assumptions established at the outset.</p>

At first, I had my doubts about how much we would actually manage to bring to the surface, precisely because secret operations are involved. It is true that we have not yet got to the bottom of this, but partly thanks to Mr Fava’s and Mr Coelho’s commitment, to whom I should both like to extend warm thanks for their work as rapporteur and chairman respectively, a ‘truth-finding momentum’ has been achieved, and there are various Member States in which it is being sustained. There are still people, certainly within the governments but also in this House, who would prefer to be left in the dark and for them, this report is not good news, because it definitely contains facts about people who have been abducted from European soil, about flights – note, Mr Helmer, the use of the word ‘flights’ rather than ‘renditions’ – via Europe in aircraft hired by the CIA. This report also reminds us of the hearings in which people have brought personal accounts and also reminds Member States of their legal obligations to look into alleged human rights violations, for that is what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I was, in fact, delighted with the reaction from Mr Gawronski from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who said: ‘There is nothing new in the report.’ Nothing new, and I tend to share his view. The big question is, of course, just why the PPE-DE Group is voting against a report that contains nothing but known facts?</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is useful to look back, and I hope that the governments will at some stage have the courage to say that a number of things have gone wrong in the past, I also share Commissioner Frattini’s view that we should also look at what lies ahead. In this light, my group would, in six months' time, like a fresh debate with specific proposals for the future, about how we should, from hereon in, deal with extraditions and diplomatic guarantees, about the trial of alleged terrorists, about the control of secret services, even maybe about European control – this is open to discussion – of transnational operations. I hope that the PPE-DE Group will then be able to show itself to be more than just a negative force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It testifies to the bankruptcy of Europe, the cradle of humanism, that not one single government there has to date thought it necessary to follow Canada’s example, not even the government of my own country, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the word from Berlin is that the same decision would be taken today, and that no apology appears to them to be required. That sort of attitude leaves me utterly cold. That sort of behaviour is unworthy; it is shameful and unacceptable. I have no sympathy whatever for those holders of political office in my own country – its foreign minister, Mr Steinmeier, in particular – who have refused to appear before our committee or even to make any sort of statement on the suffering that Khaled El Masri and Murat Kurnaz were obliged to endure. They have gone into hiding behind the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>’s committee of inquiry and were not even willing to turn up here in this House and give a statement – one without ifs and buts – to the effect that the war on terror must not be an excuse for the violation of human rights – not for anybody, whether secret services or those who occupy positions of political responsibility. Nobody in Berlin has as yet even asked themselves what they might do to ensure that such a decision would be taken differently in future. That fact, and also the obviousness of the party political manoeuvres now being attempted in Berlin in the hope of finding a watertight explanation for the abduction of Mr El Masri and the years of torment that Mr Kurnaz endured in Guantanamo, lead me to say that I have no sympathy for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament’s Amendment 224 either. I would ask the members of that group precisely what it is – despite the questions still left unanswered in Mr El Masri’s case – that prompts them to ask for a statement to the effect that the German authorities had no hand in the illegal abduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments have the fundamental duty of investigating all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens. They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the common fundamental values of the EU. That is why we have to do as we have been urged to do by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and adopt today a more strongly-worded report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These illegal flights bear witness to this fact. One in twenty of these flights is to my country, Greece. When we told him, the Prime Minister of Greece burst out laughing. When the local public prosecutor went to the airport, they refused to let him enter. My question is: can the Prime Minister of Greece enter this sort of American base? Can Mr Barroso enter the base in Souda? We have a state within a state. At some point we need to rein in this American suzerainty. It is leading us into an impasse. It is leading us into conflict; conflict with Russia, where in essence – according to the newspapers – the cold war has started, conflict with Iran and conflict with Iraq.

The war on terrorism will, though, be won only if we maintain the standards associated with the rule of law and not lay them aside for the duration of the campaign. That much has to be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Accusations have been made – which will have to be examined and investigated, and there will have to be consequences resulting from them – of the transportation of prisoners, their torture, and of the use of secret prisons. Of that there is no doubt, and the relevant public prosecutors have already started to take action, but what contribution does this report make to this? From the legal point of view, it is a collection of suspicions, with such phrases as: ‘the grave suspicion’, ‘the Committee is outraged’, ‘demands the disclosure of interview records’, ‘deplores the director of Europol’s refusal to appear’ – something that, incidentally, that person strongly disputes – ‘thinks it very probable that…’ and so on and so forth. This is not enough. It is quite obvious that the report does not meet the legal standards that we ourselves apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just consider the most important point into which inquiry was made, that being the assertion that there were secret prisons in Romania and Poland. For that, the report furnishes not even a shadow of evidence; indeed, we find in it nothing that we could not already have read in the media, and that is why the report is a complete flop. More to the point, it is tendentious, as you will find if you read it and consider the general line it takes on the work of the intelligence services. As a result of this, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote to adopt it only if a degree of balance is restored to it by a number of amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report does a good job of documenting the many facts that have surfaced surrounding the practice of illegal CIA flights and abductions and I agree with Mr Coelho that these cannot be swept under the carpet. I praise him for the way in which he has led the committee. The facts speak for themselves, but also leave questions unanswered. How much did the Member States know about the illegal activities? Whilst those who were prepared to enter into dialogue with the committee were unable to answer all questions, they did have a go, at any rate. There were others who simply refused to communicate with the committee. It is now up to the Council to react to the report. It may well be the case – as the President mentioned a moment ago – that the Council has no remit where secret services are concerned, whereas governments of Member States do, and so do national parliaments to a greater or lesser extent. Further research is called for, and that is also the main question to the Council, which we would urge to continue looking and checking whether Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are affected. I am completely at one with Commissioner Frattini’s remark that it is high time we looked into how our secret services are organised, and particularly their democratic control, and that better arrangements must be in place at European level about the use of our air space. In the final analysis, it is also a debate about the fight against terrorism, and particularly about waging this war on terrorism by means other than those used by the Americans. This is not so much criticism of America as it is a confirmation of our own values, our own guiding principles where the fight against terrorism is concerned. What matters most, at the end of the day, is adequate legal certainty for all citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all honesty, I wish we in Europe would be as critical. We do not have a problem with the US, but with our own European governments that were aware of what was happening over here. The same, in fact, also applies to Mr de Hoop Scheffer, Secretary-General of NATO, whose unwillingness to put in an appearance I deeply regret. The Council should have the courage to launch its own inquiry on the basis of Article 7 and finally to come up with some answers for the citizens of Europe. It is, after all, true that we in this House have been unable to back up all the accusations with firm legal evidence, but then we are not a court of law. European governments, however, now have the moral duty to answer the questions that have so far been left open, for the accusations are extremely serious, and so I hope that today’s vote will give this report the broadest possible support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report on the alleged CIA secret detention centres is tendentious and unreliable. It is based on half-truths, assumptions and allegations. It presents far-reaching conclusions, most of which are unsupported by evidence. Even so, the report has pronounced judgment and besmirched the honour of several states, just because they became actively involved in the war on terror, in cooperation with the United States. The committee’s work has proved nothing. It has simply condemned those who gave priority to the security of our families and countries over any imagined harm to terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">We would do well to remember that terrorists do not recognise any rights, treaties or conventions. Paradoxically, today’s report gives the green light to terrorism. It demonstrates that, in the name of the new religion of human rights, Europe is prepared to provide greater protection for terrorists’ human rights than it affords its own citizens. The single reason for all this is the unhealthy anti-Americanism rampant in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the report compromises us in the eyes of Europeans who are expecting us to provide for their security, and not to be lenient towards terrorist suspects. We have become hostages to European prejudices and lack of imagination. This report should be rejected.

The European Parliament’s Temporary Committee, of which many people were initially critical, has far exceeded established expectations.

<p class="contents">The work cannot therefore stop now. On the contrary, we now have to focus all our efforts on getting to the bottom of it, no matter what.

The EU ought to have made a forthright statement at the time when news reached us of the inhuman conditions and torture in contracted-out American prisons, and there ought to have been resistance on our part when the CIA started to indulge in its illegal practices in EU Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only did this constitute an abuse of our own much-vaunted values, but we also stood idly by – and were even supportive – while international law was broken and human rights violated, and now the European taxpayer is supposed to fork out for the misdeeds of the world’s self-appointed policeman, the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">This return to the Stone Age of human rights is, in my view, a real disgrace for the European Union. We must not allow ourselves to be reduced to the blindly obedient vassals of the USA, let alone to being the paymasters of its belligerent policies. I believe, then, that a forthright declaration on the part of the EU and an apology to the victims are long overdue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eu cred că, datorită faptului că majoritatea afirmaţiilor se bazează pe supoziţii şi nu pe fapte clare sau dovezi, este un raport care exprimă până la urmă poziţii care aduc prejudicii ţărilor membre şi implicit Uniunii europene ca ansamblu.</p>
<p class="contents">Unul dintre principiile de bază ale Uniunii Europene este apărarea drepturilor omului. Este adevărat că preşedintele Bush a declarat că au existat zboruri care au transportat persoane şi că au existat centre de detenţie, dar nu a făcut nicio precizare clară referitoare la locaţia acestor activităţi. Mi se pare exagerat să încercăm să ne acuzăm noi înşine fără a avea nicio dovadă în acest sens.</p>
<p class="contents">Apărarea drepturilor omului este o obligaţie a tuturor statelor membre. Aceeaşi obligaţie există însă şi în ceea ce priveşte asigurarea securităţii cetăţeanului. Este normal să se facă anchete atunci când există suspiciuni în acest sens, aşa cum România a făcut, dar nu cred că este normal să se considere că aceste anchete au fost superficiale dacă nu s-a ajuns la o anumită concluzie dorită neapărat de cineva. Cred că trebuie să ne respectăm reciproc ca democraţii şi instituţii parlamentare.</p>
<p class="contents">Consider incorect ca despre România să se vorbească în subcapitolul <span class="italic">Secret detention facilities</span>, neexistând nicio dovadă în acest sens, sugerându-se astfel o presupusă încălcare a drepturilor omului, în vreme ce despre alte ţări, în conformitate cu articolul 150 din raport, să se vorbească despre existenţa cazurilor din capitolul <span class="italic">Extraordinary rendition</span>. Cred că este o dovadă a unei abordări incoerente.</p>
<p class="contents">Raportul are un număr mare de inexactităţi. Amendamentele Grupului PPE/DE corijează doar o parte din ele, dar schimbă mesajul politic într-unul constructiv, de eliminare a acuzaţiilor nefondate şi de prevenire pe viitor a unor eventuale cazuri similare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many EU Member States have failed in their duty to uphold and protect human rights, and we need to seize the opportunity presented to us to finally make our declarations on human rights correspond to the practical measures that we are taking in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of demonstrating the strength of the European Parliament, which must remain impartial and independent, and, in this respect, the Fava report should serve as an example. I would encourage the European Parliament to systematically take up any instances of human rights violations that occur. We must be able to express ourselves freely and we must show that we are impartial.</p>
<p class="contents">This painstaking work has not been in vain, since the investigations were carried out in several Member States and the public was aware of what was at stake. Let us not forget that we are accountable to our electorate. The recent release of Abu Omar and his account of the torture and abuse that he suffered show that Mr Fava’s work has not been in vain. We must continue this fight to learn the truth about each and every case.</p>

This is what we are talking about today, about European democracy, in which the law should be enforced as the highest authority. No more, no less. It goes without saying that cooperation with, or granting permission to, the extraordinary transfer programme and secret prisons, be it tacit or explicit, conscious or unconscious, is not in keeping with what all of us have subscribed to by means of international and national law. Let it be clear that the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights is binding at all times. Terrorism must, and indeed can, be fought and beaten by legal means. It is unacceptable to sacrifice or restrict human rights arbitrarily, for that does no more and no less than play into the hands of the terrorist. It is therefore an impertinence to let party-political or national interests prevail in this matter or to launch into anti-Americanism. Mrs Sophia in 't Veld was right: the Americans owned up to their own wrong-doing quite some time ago.</p>

I oppose flights of extraordinary rendition anywhere, but I cannot support this report because I believe many of its conclusions are politically motivated.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. We are talking about conclusions and not findings. This is not an evidence-based report. For example, reference to 147 suspected flights into Ireland or 300 flights into Germany is totally unsubstantiated. If these conclusions were presented before any court as factual evidence, they would be thrown out of court because they would be found to be both inaccurate and speculative.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should remember that many of the things in this report are conclusions and not findings. For a report to conclude that all CIA flights should be banned in Ireland and not be banned in any of the other 26 Member States, lacks perspective and is another clear example of how politically motivated this report has become. This report does not look forward. It even fails to call for a review of the 60-year-old Chicago International Convention. However, I do have an amendment on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are saying we should come back in six months’ time with proposals. If we have proposals they should be in the report today.

CIA flights and secret prisons are only a part of this frightening development, and it is appalling that EU countries - including my own country, Sweden – have contributed to it. These Member States excuse themselves by stating that they had obtained diplomatic guarantees that those extradited would not be tortured, that their innocence or guilt would be established in fair trials and that they would not be condemned to death.

<p class="contents">The first is whether, in fighting this phenomenon that is truly striking at our society, the phenomenon of terrorism, everything is permissible. What we need to know is whether we want to build a European Union that is a community of law, in which we draw up laws with the obligation to comply with them and in which human rights are respected and safeguarded, or whether we want to take the view, Mr President — and this is the second element — that this legal area and this area of values that we want to build must be and can be compatible with a friendly and balanced relationship with the United States, an active and positive partner of the European Union, within the context of the transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer must be yes, because when tackling the phenomenon of terrorism, which threatens all of us equally, with the law on our side, the response must also come from all of us equally.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two comments, Mr President, with regard to Mr Fava’s report. In spite of the tireless work that he has done, many Members of this Parliament believe that the report does not add anything to other reports, such as that of the Council of Europe or certain information that has appeared in the press. One fundamental conclusion can be drawn. Despite the existence of a European Coordinator in the fight against terrorism, and of a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Union does not have competences in this area, since they lie with the Member States. I believe that, in this field, the European Union must take a decisive and firm step in the right direction with a view to resolving these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that there are Members of this Parliament who by hitting — or believing they are hitting – the wall with a hammer, believe they are driving in nails. It is regrettable, Mr President, that people should take every possible opportunity to condemn the judicial limbo of Guantánamo — which we clearly do not like — while remaining ominously silent over the regime that is really harming Cuba, which is the Castro regime, a silence that demonstrates double standards and regrettable moral bankruptcy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One therefore has to wonder whether the European Council and Member States will continue to stick their heads in the sand in the event that President Bush makes good on his statement to keep utilising the same illegal operations whenever or wherever he sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid the future occurrence of these or similar illegal activities, practical steps must now be taken. The Council should officially condemn these activities and enquire into Member States’ and its own knowledge and participation. The Commission should examine all agreements and arrangements with third country military and secret services to ensure that they respect human rights and fundamental rights. Member States should establish official inquiries on the CIA flights that landed on their territories, set the actions of secret services under the democratic control of the governments and instruct their airport authorities to check all suspicious private flights.</p>

<p class="contents">No one in this Chamber should be anti-American or pro-American, a defender or a detractor of any specific European country or government.

<p class="contents">Mr Fava goes further, however, and becomes a one-sided inquisitor: he grants this right to terrorists but not to the secret agents incriminated and arrested in Milan by a judge who has denied the head of the Italian secret service, General Pollari, the right to a defence, since he has rejected his request to call the previous Head of Government, Silvio Berlusconi, and the present incumbent, Romano Prodi, as witnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fava criticises, condemns and deplores all the governments of Europe, in addition to the US Administration. It does not matter to Mr Fava that an undercover intelligence operation and the squeezing of a terrorist’s right to human dignity may have prevented a repetition of the Twin Towers tragedy. The report criticises, deplores and condemns all the governments of Europe, whether on the right or on the left, as well as the Council of Europe itself, as being guilty of colluding with and submitting to the hated enemy George W. Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">Can it be that only Mr Fava is right and that the judges of just three countries – Italy, Spain and Germany – are the heroes of this report? Yet the centre-left Italian Government under Romano Prodi has challenged the documents – the ones produced by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan – before the Constitutional Court in order to protect State secrets. For Mr Fava, only terrorists have the right to a defence. General Pollari, the head of the Italian secret service, should not defend himself: he is guilty. He cannot reveal, however, that Abu Omar, a suspected CIA agent, was picked up to save him from certain death, so much so that he was not taken to Guantánamo but sent back to his own country, and he is now at liberty.

It has proven to be an expensive exercise. We do not have any figures, but I estimate the cost to be over EUR 1 million. It has duplicated Senator Marty’s efforts in the Council of Europe and has produced nothing substantially new which was not already in the public domain. Regrettably, the Left and Liberals cannot resist an opportunity to bash NATO and the United States, which, in spite of making mistakes, remains a democracy that shares European common values and is our ally in the fight against global terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations, but light on conclusive proof. Inevitably, some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to illegally torture abductees in third countries, or any proof of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland. Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, such as in Italy, the national criminal justice systems have kicked in and started prosecutions. Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but are not necessarily illegal in international law where torture is not involved, and diplomatic assurances to the Member States <span class="italic">do</span> offer safeguards in extradition cases to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also seeks to extend the powers of the European Parliament into areas like security and counter-terrorism, which are more properly the remit of national parliaments and governments. I particularly dislike the request that the British Government extend consular protection to former UK residents who had not bothered to become citizens, but chosen instead to travel to dangerous parts of the world. This is contrary to all the traditional obligations and rights of citizenship of our Member States. Finally, calls for Article 6 and 7 sanctions against Member States are totally unacceptable in my view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been demonstrated that a number people were abducted from European soil by American entities, and this was, in my view, very definitely illegal. Not as much has come to light as some might well have expected, but that is attributable to the tactics of obfuscation adopted not only by the USA, but also by many European governments. Today, again, from what I hear, a number of Members of this House are more interested in getting the fog generator up and running than in getting at the facts of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to my own country, Austria, the report does indeed refer ‘only’ to the abductions of non-Austrians outside Austrian territory, but this is not about people’s rights as citizens; it is about their rights as people! The fact is that, if people are abducted and put into the hands of ‘judicial authorities’ that are known to use torture, some of them extensively, then it is scandalous that European governments do not intervene and see that justice is done, whether or not the persons in question are citizens of the states over which they rule, for they are, in any case, human beings who are living legally in our European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think there is something highly problematic when a number of governments simply fail to respond, and when a number of national parliaments do not take seriously the obligation incumbent on them of getting to the bottom of what has been going on. I do think that this House, in setting up this committee, did the right thing, for it makes it a matter of record that we, in this House, are committed to human rights and to those rules that are necessary in order that those rights be indeed recognised and put into practice in Europe. That is the point of this committee, and that is the conclusion to which its report brings us.</p>

<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we in the Group of the European People’s Party will be unable to vote for the report’s adoption if it continues to make reference to matters that we have not been mandated to consider; if, as well as taking an unbalanced view of individual Member States, it also indulges in baseless suppositions concerning the presence of secret prisons on EU soil, contains unsubstantiated assertions, generalisations and tendentious insinuations and demands disproportionate action against certain Member States, including, for example, the suspension of the right of one of them to vote in the Council, and, finally, if it depicts the activities of the intelligence services as criminal in nature.</p>

<p class="contents">Illegal CIA flights, though they are in themselves flagrantly illegal, were simply one instrument in a cruel and entirely illegal system of detentions, interrogations, torture and disappearances.

The fight against terrorism will continue to be one of the European Union’s priorities, and we will need the greatest possible cooperation with our North American ally, but that will only be possible if there is mutual trust and full respect for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This House must send out a crystal-clear message. Europe has already learnt the lesson of torture, of detentions without safeguards, persecutions and concentration camps. It is on the basis of those painful experiences that we have created democratic rules and international law and we are not going to give them up, not even in the name of global security.

<p class="contents">This report describes in detail the lack of control at European airports, which enabled the CIA to operate a fleet of private aircraft in what is referred to as 'extraordinary rendition’. It demonstrates that US military planes were also used for the illegal transport of prisoners, at least to Guantánamo, and that these planes stopped off at airports and military bases on European territory, the facilities of which were subsequently used as temporary detention centres under the guise of operations such as 'Enduring Freedom'.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only did the European governments authorise, knowingly or otherwise, such transport, compromise the security of their countries and of Europe and undermine the services charged with ensuring that security, they also sullied the good name of the European military institutions and made them, objectively speaking, complicit by commission or omission. The report also proves that European governments, including the Portuguese Government, continued to authorise, or to fail to control, flights to Guantánamo; they continued, quite openly, with illegal imprisonment even after this temporary committee of the European Parliament had been set up; and they sought to keep national and European members of parliament in the dark regarding these operations. In this way, they did not collaborate in the fight against terrorism; methods such as these will never enable us to bring the real terrorists to justice.</p>

After all, not everyone was happy with the committee being set up, because it is true that it was not a real committee of inquiry with judicial powers and because an inquiry into possible violations of human rights had already been mounted in the Council of Europe. Today, however, both its advocates and its opponents will have to admit that this committee of inquiry has definitely done a useful job. It is, of course, true that we could not expect a solid burden of proof, and we did not always get it, but what we did get was factual elements. Many eyewitness accounts and official visits have exposed a system from which the simple conclusion can be drawn that various European Member States were very much aware of illegal practices, while others did not know what went on on their territories. I find both conclusions are equally painful. What did come to the surface very clearly was the difference in opinion between Europe and the United States about the way in which a balance should be struck between the fight against terrorism and respecting fundamental and human rights. It is not a coincidence that this discussion, as are the conclusions, is consistent with the conclusions involving the SWIFT affair and the discussion between the EU and the United States with regard to the transfer of passenger data. I should like to make one observation in this connection. Although we have all examined the same facts and heard the same eyewitness statements, the conclusions vary widely, and at times, the discussion is based too much on ideological motives or national interests. I still hope that this House will be united in this afternoon’s vote and will be sending out a clear signal, because there is no room for bargaining where the protection of fundamental and human rights are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I see this report as an opportunity for the Member States to take a good look at themselves and recognise that it is a fact that fighting terrorism has often justified the adoption of many intrusive laws. It is now urgent to undertake an evaluation of all anti-terrorist legislation. It is time to ensure judicial control mechanisms and strict parliamentary scrutiny of security services in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In Romania, where new legislation on secret services is being adopted, it is advisable to look at this package of legislation from this particular angle. New bodies that centralise intelligence are being created for better coordination of secret services. We have to be careful and place these central bodies under enhanced parliamentary control. This report is crucial because it highlights the increasing prevalence of the mantra ‘security at all costs’. It depends on us to focus more on civil rights and earn the confidence of our people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can only mean one thing, namely that the report contains more conjecture, political comment and opinion than plain facts and logical conclusions drawn from the latter. We would all support the report if it contained nothing but facts, because nobody can deny facts.</p>
<p class="contents">There is evidence that political intentions took precedence over the truth, facts and common sense in the course of the committee’s work. The report contains a sentence stating that Poland and the United States signed a secret agreement, whereby foreign agents acting on the territory of the Republic of Poland would not be subject to the jurisdiction of Polish courts. A letter from the government to our committee was quoted in this connection. The difficulty is that the letter in question confirms precisely the opposite. The question then arises as to what might be the ulterior motive driving those who proposed such statements in the report and who support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee’s work has also produced some very important and much-needed conclusions. Presumably, we all agree that security is a fundamental human need. Accordingly, efficient and well-organised secret services are required. As they strive to protect the lives and health of their citizens against threats, including terrorism, these services not only can, but also must, cooperate effectively with the services of other states.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the activities of the secret service of a European Union Member State be free from any kind of control by its parliament and courts? The answer has to be no, it is simply not possible. There is, of course, room for debate as to the extent and intensity of such control, but if these services are not subject to any kind of control, they tend to subdivide into smaller units and operate on the principle that the end justifies the means. This is particularly important in countries where the government has a monopoly on authority and tends to use such services for its own purposes, to attain aims it alone is privy to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, though, with its 270 amendments, now contains facts and new information only in part, but, on the other hand, numerous suppositions, assertions and – as it did before – insinuations. I am sure that the rapporteur, Mr Fava, does not want that any more than anyone else does. The principal impression given is that the USA is in the dock, and so, if it is, the terrorists who really should be in the dock are no longer the principal subject for consideration in the report. If that is the case, then that is a political error all round.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also, however, contains errors of fact concerning Europol, for example, which is alleged to have cooperated with the American secret services; the claim is also made that American secret service agents had worked at Europol as liaison officers. Even though Europol’s director, Mr Ratzel, wrote a letter to make the facts plain – namely that Europol is of course not a secret service and cannot exercise a coordinating role over the services in Europe, and that, of course, no liaison officer from an American secret service department has ever worked there – the factually incorrect account remains in the report. This does damage to this House’s credibility, and we must firmly repudiate it.</p>
<p class="contents">If various items founded solely on assertions and insinuations are dressed up as facts and then not voted out of the report, or if false accounts of events are left to stand, then the report is not doing what it was supposed to do, and then we have to ask ourselves whether the EUR 2 million that were needed for the committee of inquiry can be regarded as a justifiable expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is precisely what this is about. We have documented the flights, kidnappings, abductions and deportations that have been carried out as completely unacceptable. In the case of Sweden, we are concerned here with the deportation of the two Egyptians following a government decision on asylum, as well as with what happened at Bromma Airport when the deportation was implemented. In that case, the CIA went too far in violating the common rules that Sweden has supported nationally, in the EU and in the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have agreed that diplomatic assurances cannot be used as guarantees in the case of deportations to third countries and that a foreign power cannot take implementing decisions without the national police taking full responsibility, even if the case concerned is one of suspected terrorism. Moreover, victims must obtain redress and receive compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">What would worry me is if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were to take their lead from the CIA committee and vote against the report, as it is especially important in Sweden that the Swedish Conservative MEPs should vote in favour of the report and so enable us to agree that there should be no repeat of these matters and that, although terrorism must be fought, it should not be fought through the violation of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seven months ago, I expressed the hope that the final report of the Temporary Committee would strike a better balance than the version that was current at the time. I must say today that this is unfortunately not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which sends out an important message to the European people and to our partners, mixes fact with speculation, deals selectively with results of the investigation, assesses individual countries on the basis of whether or not they have cooperated with the committee rather than what they have actually done, and makes a whole range of accusations with scarcely any evidence. Naturally, with the committee’s limited powers it was not possible to substantiate a number of the claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadder still is the fact that we have relinquished the one ambition that had a chance of succeeding under these circumstances, namely a proposed framework for effectively combating terrorism without hindering human rights, and for ensuring, via workable proposals, that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, guaranteeing the citizens’ security is the basic duty of any government. With the army and secret services facing exceptional circumstances, mistakes do occasionally occur. We now know that this has happened since 11 September. It is extremely important that these excesses are condemned. I feel it was a big mistake of the committee to try deliberately to create the impression that such excesses were endemic, rather than being isolated cases, in spite of the fact that there is not a single shred of evidence to support that view.</p>
<p class="contents">Some MEPs have been making unfounded accusations that this is a political report, not a legal document. I should like, if I may, to remind the Chamber of our duty – both to our electorates and to this institution – to provide information in a balanced, objective manner.</p>

Its main message is that we should never seek more security at the expense of human rights. Moreover, there is no contradiction between defending security and defending human rights. We could, indeed, consolidate our security only if we respect our basic values. The terrorists want to undermine our values and make us abandon our way of life. We can defeat them precisely by defending our values and by refusing to abandon them.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not possible to prove beyond any doubt that certain violations of human rights took place in specific countries and with the cooperation of specific governments or of specific officials. However, it is beyond any doubt that unacceptable acts could have happened without being noticed by the national institutions concerned, without shaking the public conscience or without being resisted by the European Union Member States, since they apparently lack the capacity to oppose. Thus the report led us to the conclusion that we need better cooperation in the field of intelligence, as well as in the field of direct action against terrorists, in order to increase our strength in coping with security challenges, without decreasing our capacity to respect and promote human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a better joint educational effort in order to raise the general respect for human rights and to encourage political leaders to look for a better equilibrium between values and <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>. We need more political solidarity among the Member States in order to make them less vulnerable to the pressures of those political players who believe in the power of force. We need a common foreign and security policy that will allow us, at the same time, to deter the terrorists and promote our values in the world. We need a transnational democracy that is able to strike a balance between effective security services and popular oversight of their activities. To sum up, we need more Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is striking, in view of the facts published, is the stand of Javier Solana, who, in this most important case, has buried his head in the political sandbox of his own interests and ambitions, adopting an approach of see-no-evil, hear-no-evil and speak-no-evil. Mr Solana, in his capacity as our most senior foreign policy representative, has clearly fallen short of our expectations. On 2 May 2006 he claimed in his address to the committee that he is not aware of anything and has no information which might help to clarify the circumstances of this unprecedented case. So it is quite proper to ask the question: who failed? Was it Mr Solana himself? Was it his administration? Or was it a system that facilitates the concealment of violations of human rights?

<p class="contents">The last speech again addressed the Council, urging it to act, but, as I said on the Council’s behalf at the beginning of this debate, the Council itself has no powers in this area, and I must repudiate the accusations levelled in one of the last interventions at Mr Solana, for he has certainly offered, in this matter, whatever cooperation he was able to give.</p>
<p class="contents">However, something else that emerged from the debate is that numerous initiatives have been taken in the Member States, primarily on the part of their parliaments, and these investigations are in line with the demands made in your report. While I see it as right and proper to set such investigations in motion in order to bring the facts to light, I also find it regrettable that there are various points in the report at which suppositions are made out to be facts.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Kaufmann’s reference to the cases in Germany, I have to say – albeit without wishing to pre-empt the <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>’s interim report – that the investigations have revealed that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the German authorities; in particular, no evidence was found to back up the recurrent allegations to the effect that German officials had known of Mr El-Masri’s arrest and rendition.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee of inquiry is also considering the case of Mr Kurnaz, and it has come to light that the US Government did not, in 2002, offer to release Mr Kurnaz in the manner surmised by the report. The committee will, however, continue to consider this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your various references to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, let me say that you may perhaps regard this as an argument from formality, but the Council is not entitled to initiate action of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini also mentioned the role of the secret services, and there were also contributions from the floor that stressed the importance of their work, although it has to be said that the question of on what basis that work is done is of course an important one. That, too, though, is a task primarily for the nation states, and it is, in the final analysis, the parliaments who must define the demands to which these secret services are subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has also been made, in some speeches, to relations across the Atlantic. It has to be said, in general terms, that, in the fight against terrorism, measures in the interests of internal security that are generally applicable rather than limited to one Member State of the European Union can in fact be undertaken only in very close cooperation with the United States, and that cooperation needs to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, in this cooperation across the Atlantic, to make clear that the war on international terrorism has to be waged on the basis of the common values on which the European Union and the United States agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to all the speakers as well as those who have acknowledged the contribution that the Commission and I myself have made to the work of this Parliament’s committee of enquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the principle on which we can all agree is that security and fundamental freedoms cannot be pitted against one another. There is no contradiction between citizens’ right to security and proper, scrupulous respect for people’s fundamental rights. In connection with the fight against terrorism, we are also aware that, if even a single violation is found to have been committed during the investigations, the courts are then bound to punish those responsible for this violation and to reject that evidence, and that then allows the terrorists to strengthen their propaganda against us. That is a triple setback in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the rules must be obeyed during the investigations, not least for a reason that is intrinsic to our strategy in the fight against terrorism: if the rules are in fact broken, the law also ends up being broken, which is bad enough in itself, and above all we do not actually get to convict the terrorists. I have to say that there have been too few actual convictions of terrorists for extremely serious crimes throughout the world, compared with the number that have been investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the added value of this parliamentary investigation will be clear even to those of you who have expressed your doubts today. First of all, it will have added value if – as I myself hope and as many of you have said – we refrain from claiming that the report is a condemnation of the United States, and instead we declare that we want to ascertain the truth without making any blanket condemnations and without passing judgment, which is the job of the courts. Moreover, I believe that even those of you who expressed your doubts in your speeches can accept that this is an important report, provided that we emphasise one point: this report makes no decisions on events for which there is as yet no proof, since that will have to be established by the national enquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also take this opportunity to reject with absolute indignation the completely unsubstantiated allegations against President Barroso, which fortunately were only made by a single Member of this Parliament, Mr Catania: these are unworthy and unfounded accusations, and I feel duty-bound to emphatically reject them.</p>
<p class="contents">The added value of the investigation, which has culminated in Mr Fava’s report, lies in Parliament’s sending out a message of unity and firmness, particularly to terrorists. In my view, this message should make it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the power of the law and of respect for fundamental rights will enable us to strike an even stronger blow against terrorism, rather than a weaker blow. The political message to terrorists must therefore run as follows: they should not see this as good news, because abiding by our laws and punishing those who break them makes our institutions stronger rather than weaker, precisely because terrorists break the law whereas we must obey it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I still hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a large majority, so as to encourage the Member States to fulfil their institutional and moral duty by establishing the whole truth and tightening up the rules in future, starting with the rules governing the secret services.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we need greater Euro-Atlantic collaboration, greater collaboration with the United States, for the sake of the dual principle of security and respect for the rights of the individual. This, in my view, is the political lesson that we can learn from today’s debate.</p>

<p class="contents">- that there is an ongoing programme of kidnappings of ‘suspects' (a fact confirmed by George W. Bush), who, without being charged and without any guarantee of respect for the most basic right to a defence, are subsequently held in illegal detention centres and are brutally tortured;</p>
<p class="contents">- that the Member States were aware of this ‘programme' as part of EU-NATO relations (senior members of the US Administration have made assertions of this nature, which have not yet been refuted), but exerted no control over their air space and airports as they are duty bound to do;</p>
<p class="contents">- that the alarming lack of firm answers from the bodies that should be the first to take the initiative of clarifying the situation only serves to reinforce the validity of these already well-documented allegations;</p>
<p class="contents">- that far-reaching investigations must take place, via commissions of inquiry set up in the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Such conclusions justify the stance of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), which has long been condemning these criminal acts perpetrated by the US Administration in violation of international law and the most basic human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The PCP tabled the initiative of setting up a commission of inquiry in the Portuguese Parliament in order to obtain clarification, to bring those responsible to account and to prevent these atrocities from continuing to take place. This initiative was rejected by the Portuguese Socialists, Social Democrats and People's Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For it has now been proven that there are moral demands that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against terrorism, illegal tools cannot be used, for doing so will produce the opposite effect from the one desired, and will in every case come to light. The work of the committee may perhaps have an effect on the future of the Guantánamo detention camp as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, the Council of Europe also prepared a report on the CIA flights. That Council’s report contains several concrete cases, but the European Parliament did not even strive to draw up its own catalogue of the many concrete – often hear-rending – cases examined during the hearings. The committee’s goal was to draw lessons for the European implementation of general, universally recognised rights and principles, and to focus on what remains to be done. Member States should examine from a legal perspective their anti-terrorist as well as their air traffic legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the EP officially has no influence on the decisions of Member States, I hope that the result of the final parliamentary vote will have an effect on Member States, the various institutions, and in the long run may even be able to influence the American approach. We must recognise the importance of the fight against terror and of the successes achieved in this area by the United States. Action against terrorism cannot, however, mean immunity from the obligation to respect human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
