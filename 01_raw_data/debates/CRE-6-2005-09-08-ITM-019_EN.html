Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that religion has in some cases been exploited for political and economic gains. Nor can it be denied that religious fanaticism has, in some cases, led to many extremist manifestations aimed at our democratic institutions. In essence, the balance between religious freedom and adequate protection of the citizen is a very fine one and requires extreme wisdom in framing legislation, coupled with an honest determination to apply it correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Not unexpectedly, such will is lacking in totalitarian states, where religion is perceived merely as a possible threat to the political stability of the ruling regimes. This, it appears, is the case with China. Recently, thanks to international pressure, the Chinese Government put into effect new regulations on religious affairs, but it is already abundantly evident that these changes do not go far enough and policies limiting religious freedom persist. Numerous examples of persecution and harassment of religious groups and individuals in China are well documented and need not be mentioned here again. We call on the Chinese Government to put a real end to religious repression in the country and, furthermore, to immediately release from detention and stop the prosecution of all individuals persecuted by the state authorities as a consequence of their religious beliefs and practices.</p>

China could become a strategic partner for the European Union in the effort to create a new world order. It should be borne in mind, however, that a genuine partnership must be built on the foundation of shared values. Our positive approach to China cannot overlook violations of human rights in the People’s Republic of China, nor can it condone attacks on political and trade union freedoms. We must never forget either that China is not a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution, the European Parliament highlights violations of fundamental human rights in China, notably concerning freedom of religion, and in particular as regards Christian churches and denominations. We call on the Chinese authorities to put an end to strict controls, repression and persecution of religious groups, both Christian and others. I have in mind also Tibetan Buddhism and Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roman Catholic Church has largely been driven underground. This is a cause of great concern for us, as is the situation of the Protestant churches. In addition, we call for explanations of the fate of certain Roman Catholic bishops and missing priests. We call for the release of Catholic priests and Protestant clergy who have been arrested and imprisoned, and for the release of all lay persons punished for their religious practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese authorities must undertake to guarantee compliance with Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which provides for freedom of religion in China. I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the information provided by the organisation Reporters Without Borders, concerning the conviction of Mr Shi Tao, an Internet user. On 30 April 2005 a court in Changsha sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment for revealing State secrets. Mr Shi Tao was a journalist working for the <span class="italic">Dangdai Shangbao</span> economic publication, and his crime was to publish on the Internet information contained in a confidential Central Propaganda Department document, forwarded to the editorial department prior to the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The action of the Yahoo Internet portal that revealed Mr Shi Tao’s details to the court should also be investigated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The growing relations between the European Union and China offer a great opportunity for both parties, and I would go as far as to say even for the world in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these relations cannot be based solely on improving the commercial relations of each party. If what the European Union wants is policy on China to be credible, it must demand much more clearly that it radically improve its policy on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union-China dialogue on human rights is a good instrument for doing this, but I fear that it is clearly being underused. There are various problems that China is not dealing with responsibly, given its role in the world, which is becoming increasingly interdependent: trade union freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom and also religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who advocate that governmental and public institutions should be secular in nature and that it is essential to ensure the separation of political and religious powers, but I also believe that true secularism must guarantee freedom of religious practice in the private sphere. I am therefore concerned about the constant complaints from various groups concerning the difficulties they face practising their religion in China.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as I oppose a State providing special finance and support for a particular religion rather than others — a few days ago, for example, I condemned the fact that the Commission had dedicated so much money to the World Youth Days promoted by the Catholic Church — I do not believe it is acceptable for institutions to violate the individual right to religious freedom. As such, this is a human rights issue that we must complain about and denounce.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, in this Resolution we are calling on the Chinese authorities to put an immediate end to all religious repression, to ensure respect for international standards of human rights and to guarantee democracy, freedom of expression, association and the press, and also, as the Resolution states, religious freedom in all territory controlled by the Chinese authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These days, nothing matters except the pursuit of economic growth and export benefits on the world market, achieved by low wages, poor working conditions and the banning of independent trade unions, all of which is highly reminiscent of the dictatorial model which South Korea used in the past in order to become an industrialised nation. Whether the large majority of the people will gain any benefits from this will not be evident until a few decades down the line. Meanwhile, a society has been created with large discrepancies between the people in terms of power and income and with major disregard for nature, landscape and the environment. It is a far cry from the protection of man and the environment that we Socialists hold dear.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Chinese leaders are no longer Communists, they have unfortunately retained the worst features of the Communist state tradition. They do not tolerate independent organisations and other centres of power alongside them. People can adhere to a faith, but are not allowed to organise themselves to any serious degree. The leadership fears that independent churches could become a source of opposition, and so, in line with a combination of atheist tradition and power politics, it is the government that decides which faiths shall be permitted and under what circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of general knowledge that it is not the official Catholic Church that is allowed, but a nationally controlled variant. Less well known is the fact that the Jewish faith – which, before the revolution of 1949, had a large following, particularly in the large cities along the East coast – is completely banned. We should not give this China the opportunity to threaten neighbouring countries or clamp down on domestic opposition. It should therefore go without saying that the arms embargo should be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Under no circumstances should EU Member States be allowed to sell arms to China. Any attempt to lift the arms embargo would be reprehensible. It would not be in anybody’s interest to launch a new costly arms race and incite new threats. That is exactly why Europe, too, should press for disarmament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No wonder Christians are so brutally deprived of their rights and persecuted as they currently are when we consider how some of Europe’s leadership class behave. Even in this House, there are those who, when they speak, cannot bring themselves to denounce the violations of Christians’ human rights in China unless they have prefaced them with expressions of hostility to the Church that have nothing whatever to do with this issue, and who, in a debate devoted to the fundamental rights of victims of persecution, cannot refrain from indulging in criticism of World Youth Day.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is of course no Christian monopoly in this European Union of ours, and quite rightly not, 85% of the EU’s inhabitants are Christian, 56% being Catholics. These people, too, have a right to appropriate political representation. Who is supposed to speak up, not only for the persecuted and tiny Christian minorities in China, but also for that country’s Jews, Muslims and Buddhists, if we do not? The Islamic world takes up the cause of their brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith who are persecuted in places such as China; it is only we Europeans who have to keep on downplaying these violations of human rights or adopting a critical attitude. In so doing, we make ourselves complicit in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing the pictures of Mr Blair at the EU/China summit reminds me of how it was he who told us that the EU was for him more than a free trade zone. I see no evidence of that being so, for, if he really did regard it as a community of values, he would adopt a foreign policy that focused on human rights – including these human rights – even in his dealings with a large country such as China. The same can be said of Chancellor Schröder, to whose solitary attempt at relaxing the arms embargo we have, thank God, put a stop. We need a unity that transcends party boundaries if we are to speak out clearly, even to a large country such as China, in the cause of human rights and religious freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is precisely this government violation of the freedom of religion in the People’s Republic of China that has led to a growing stream of flourishing, non-registered Protestant house churches. In the light of China’s new rules in religious matters that took effect on 1 March this year, they are exposed to a wave of random government repression, including cruel disturbances of services, hefty fines, arrests, destruction of private houses and beatings or reprimands along the lines of ‘teachers cannot believe in Christianity’. What was particularly shocking was the account of the raid on 7 August this year on a Protestant house church in Shenyang province. Among the thirty worshippers, there were some 10 women who were forced first to undress and then to pose naked. Those who offered resistance were brutally beaten up.</p>
<p class="contents">During a recent inquiry into whether it is the central government or local authorities that are responsible for the violations of freedom of religion in China, a salient point came to light. Some local authorities are sympathetic towards Christian fellow citizens and actively protect them on account of their loyal contribution to the local economic and social development. This is a practical example that the Chinese central government would do well to follow, because after all, it always determines what exactly normal religious activities are, and it is those alone that are permitted by law.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would ask you, your fellow-Commissioners, or else the Council, to explain in detail to the Chinese authorities this disturbing criterion for the fundamental right of freedom of religion. What are normal religious activities? More than anything, I hope that you and the Council will press for the release of all those who, whatever their beliefs, are imprisoned or suffer under the lack of freedom of religion in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would remind the House that we recently debated violations of human rights in Tibet. The term violations of human rights is somewhat of a euphemism, when the actions actually being referred to include murder, imprisonment, mass disappearances, and when people are prevented from practising their religion and there is no question of freedom of any sort. Let us call a spade a spade. This should be termed criminal activity, not violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been observing events in China for the last 60 years. Those of us who hail from former Communist states know full well how Communist authorities tend to behave, regardless of whether they are ideologically committed to Communism or not. That is immaterial. I speak from personal experience, and still have a strong memory of the early years of Communism in Poland. Quite simply, it is a case of a vicious Communist or post-Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is persecuted. Believers in Islam, Buddhism, Jews ... all are hunted down. As to those that are persecuted most cruelly ... well, perhaps not, because in Tibet Buddhists have been persecuted equally cruelly, but it should be said that Christians and especially Catholics are persecuted. In particular, those Catholics are targeted who adhere to a fundamental principle of the Catholic Church, namely unity with the wider church, personified in the Pope. Certain schisms have been encouraged, and a national church has come into being, though obviously this could never be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are getting worse, not better. As stated in our resolution, the number of arrests is increasing. So too is the number of cases of torture, unexplained disappearances, detentions through the criminal system, and the number of isolation camps. The very term ‘isolation camp’ should make our blood run cold. We Europeans are well aware of the horrors perpetrated under Nazi German and Communist Russian domination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has had diplomatic relations with China for 30 years. There has been much talk of dialogue. I wonder about the nature of this dialogue and what it involves. It seems to mean this House adopting one resolution after another on Thursday afternoons when most Members are already on their way home.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, others who could have a significant influence on what might take place in China are presenting the case for a relaxation of the embargo. France and Germany are doing so particularly eloquently, maintaining that the embargo is ineffective. All this is happening in the context of a situation when we should be isolating China as much as possible. This is not just about economics. Above all, it is about moral principles. The European Union should make it abundantly clear that there can be no deals or dialogue of any kind with China. China deserves outright condemnation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We simply cannot go along with this view. Respect for fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, is not an internal Chinese concern. It is a concern for all those who are not egotists or opportunists.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear in mind that freedom of religion is also possible in non-democratic countries. Czechs, Jews and people from the Netherlands emigrated to Poland in the 16th century not because our country was a democracy, but because all religions could be practised in complete freedom in Poland. We should also remember, however, that there were and still are political systems that only recognise religious leaders of different persuasions if they support the theory that all authority is God-given, even the cruellest.</p>
<p class="contents">China should respect not only freedom of religion, but also the independence of churches and religious associations. Secular authorities cannot be allowed to influence decisions on who might become a Catholic bishop, the 15th Dalai Lama or the 12th Panchen Lama. Tibetan monks cannot be compelled to attend ideological training. The 87-year-old Gongola Lama has stated that on training courses of that nature, instructors indoctrinate the monks on the nature of love for the common Chinese fatherland, and mould them into subservience to the law. They also teach the monks that the Dalai Lama is a danger. Certain monks are forced to sign a document stating that they no longer recognise the spiritual and political leadership of the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">World history is full of accounts of repression for religious motives. It is worth remembering, however, that such repression proved ineffective, even under the cruellest of regimes. It will prove ineffective in China as well. It does not matter if a person has their work or property taken away, is imprisoned, expelled, crucified or gassed. Neither the Pope nor the Dalai Lama can call up any so-called divisions, because the source of religious strength is not to be found in believers or in the clergy, but in the very nature of religion itself. For most religions, death is not a tragic end but the start of a new life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For many years now, Communist China had been failing to meet the most basic universal standards and requirements concerning freedom of expression, thought, action and creation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the most recent EU-China Ministerial meeting in May 2005, the Union expressed its concern with regard to four aspects of human rights. In particular, it called for those still imprisoned further to the 1989 pro-democracy movement to be released, for censorship of the media to be reduced, for the ‘re-education through work’ system to be reformed, and for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We ought also to be calling for an end to repression of the Roman Catholic Church. The latter is not recognised by the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 126 families lost loved ones in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and the circumstances surrounding that event remain unclear. According to Amnesty International by the end of last year alone over 50 persons were imprisoned for publishing on the Internet information that could be damaging to the authorities. Amnesty International has also reported that 3 400 people were executed and over 6 000 sentenced to death in 2004 in China. These statistics are truly alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese Government is mercilessly exterminating the people of Tibet. It is resorting to false accusations of law-breaking, fixing the outcome of trials in advance and organising mass deportations of Tibetans from areas subsequently resettled with ethnic Chinese. Over 100 Tibetan religious leaders are being held in Chinese prisons on charges of subversive activity. The world is standing idly by as one of the oldest and most important cultures of all times vanishes before its very eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">How many more tragedies and statistics will it take for the world to start taking notice of the violations of human rights being perpetrated in China? Diplomacy will fail to produce the desired outcome. The Union must rise to an enormous challenge.

<p class="contents">Although significant progress has been made on human rights issues in China over recent years, in particular in the area of economic and social rights, the European Union remains concerned by the overall human rights situation in the country and, more specifically, by the restrictions on civil and political rights that have been enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for human rights is, in fact, a crucial component of the European Union’s external policy. The European Union has regularly raised this issue with the Chinese authorities in a frank and open manner, both through political dialogue – including at the top level, as was recently the case during the last bilateral summit held in Beijing on 5 September – and through the bilateral dialogue specifically devoted to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the European-Chinese dialogue, the issue of freedom of belief, religion, expression and association has always been one of the main priorities of the European Union. The Union, in particular, has continually expressed its deep concern regarding the situation of individuals who have been persecuted or stripped of their fundamental rights for having openly practised their faith, no matter, moreover, what their religion or belief. A number of imprisoned religious figures mentioned by Members of this House appear on the list of individual cases that the Union systematically sends to its Chinese negotiating partners in the framework of the human rights dialogue. Furthermore, the European Union has, on several occasions, officially approached the Chinese authorities through its representatives in Beijing. Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche and Pastor Zhang Rongliang – to mention some recent examples – are among those on whom these actions have been focused.</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of the death penalty, or at least the introduction of a moratorium on its application, China’s swift ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and cooperation with the United Nations’ mechanisms also feature among the priority issues regularly addressed with the Chinese authorities. In the latter case, the European Union specifically made calls, during the last session of the human rights dialogue held in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 February 2005, for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief to be able to travel to China as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union undoubtedly intends to continue and develop the dialogue with Beijing in the area of human rights through seminars connected to these issues. Alongside the dialogue, these seminars also make it possible to raise the awareness of certain major players in Chinese civil society. We hope that the next session of the specific dialogue on human rights, which will take place in Beijing on 24 and 25 October 2005, will enable significant progress to be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
