<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, Western Europe was in the process of creating the great single market, an objective that we set for 1992. History decided that the huge expectations linked to integration would in turn be linked to the unexpected hope of unifying the whole of Europe in peace and democracy. Since that extraordinary moment, we have taken huge steps forward, and large parts of the democracies born out of the collapse of the Soviet bloc will soon be part of the Union. Our economy, despite the problems and uncertainties, is enjoying an unprecedented level of prosperity; in Europe we have a quality of life that is the envy of the world; and, above all, differences in wealth and opportunity between the Member States have been reduced over the years: this is a success that no other political organisation can boast of.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, say that we are satisfied. We cannot because, for some time, doubt has been taking root in the hearts and minds of Europeans. This is a reaction to the process of globalisation of the planet with the far-reaching and ever-faster changes that it entails. Today, Europe wonders if it will be in a position to keep hold of the levers of change in order to continue to control globalisation, or if it will confine itself to accepting the situation and protecting itself against the dangers. We need only to listen to the questions asked by the citizens, questions that are very simple. They are asking the following: are the cultural reference points with which we identify going to be eradicated? Why is it that sometimes – in fact, often – becoming old implies the risk of getting poorer? Why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness? Questions like this give rise to two opposing attitudes: one part of our society withdraws into itself, searching for an illusory security behind antiquated, and sometimes tribal, slogans, which foment xenophobia and intolerance; but the overwhelming majority of Europeans, however, look to us for positive answers and always ask us what Europe is doing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a healthy and mature position because it assumes a simple fact: no European country can act alone in the globalised world and no one can, alone, meet the challenges of the rise of the large countries of Asia, the technological challenge of North America or the migratory flows from the South. The strength to meet these challenges – our strength – lies solely in our Union. Time has proved Monnet, De Gasperi, Adenauer and Schuman right; we must combine what we have in common; we must fight for the common interest because that is the only way in which we can protect the individual’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was the culmination of our collective recognition of this situation; in Gothenburg, the project was completed, fully incorporating sustainability as a key component, and this strategy generated energy and enthusiasm; it made the Spring European Council the high point in terms of control, drive and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite everyone’s efforts, this process is faltering. Operational decisions are becoming increasingly rare and, often, we are limited to calls for voluntary action. Why is this the case? Because, in order to have a real impact, the strategy needs a project that is coherent and verifiable; it needs to organise the necessary instruments, those of the Member States and of the Union, which includes the Union budget. We must, in fact, use our resources to increase the prosperity of Europe in line with its values; we need to transform the Union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy; we need to ensure jobs for our citizens and make economic growth socially and environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Before going into the detail of some of today’s decisions, I want to explain the spirit that drives us and the procedures we followed. Budgetary planning is about linking resources to needs. Since resources are limited, financial decisions must follow priorities and political choices; that is, follow and not precede: this is a fundamental concept. I have stated on many occasions that it is unacceptable to plan the future of our finances on the basis of a simple percentage point. Some have said – in all seriousness too – that the Union budget must not be more than 1% of European GDP. The problem with this position is that it puts figures before the political project: it is like starting to build a house from the roof. I understand that countries introducing difficult reforms also want the Union to apply restrictive policies; nevertheless, this approach is incoherent because national expenditure – at the level of each individual state – and Union expenditure – incurred jointly – are not interchangeable as they are different in qualitative terms. The Union budget is not unnecessary expenditure that must be reduced to a minimum; Community expenditure funds common policies, that is to say those activities that the Member States have decided to manage together; these are more effective than national initiatives and, in many cases, are unavoidable because they address problems that are by their very nature supranational. There are many instances, in the life of the EU, where EUR 25 spent together is worth more than one euro spent in each of 25 countries. This is an absolutely essential concept that we should fix in our minds. Making savings in the Union’s budget does not increase national public resources, but only undermines the foundations of the house we all live in. We must, however, channel the available resources towards the priorities in such a way as to maximise the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, the Commission discussed the new Financial Perspective by first examining what needs to be done – that is to say, starting with the project for the Europe that we want to see – and then, only afterwards by tackling figures and percentages. The results do not, however, depend solely on the amount available. For example, we have established that the current budgetary structure and certain management rules are too rigid and that this rigidity has often put a brake on the Union’s work to the detriment of the common interest. This is not just an issue of the quantity of resources, but also of the way in which they can be managed. We are, therefore, also proposing a budgetary structure that can respond more flexibly to new and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final, fundamental observation before moving on to the specific aspects of the proposal. Every organisation’s financial plan is, as we have said, an expression of its underlying principles. Of the Union’s principles, the one that I would like to stress is that of solidarity between the citizens and the Member States, solidarity that sees resources transferred from the richer countries to the poorer countries and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our plan is in line with this underlying political decision and develops it in a new way, by placing cohesion policy more clearly at the service of competitiveness and employment than was previously the case. There are essentially three reasons behind this decision: it is a choice in favour of coherence, justice and opportunity. I say coherence because the key objective of our political policies in future years will be to encourage sustainable development. Unbalanced development will spawn rejection and fear of Europe in the most disadvantaged and outermost regions, rather than trust and involvement. Furthermore, it is a question of justice because no one can be asked to participate in a joint project without being given the opportunity of keeping in step with growth. Finally, it is a question of opportunity, because experience teaches us that balanced and sustainable development, especially in the poorest regions, is itself a source of further prosperity for the richest regions. This is the thought underlying the financial plan that I put before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to briefly explain the key points. As I have said, there are three major priorities: to encourage sustainable development, to put into practice the idea of European citizenship and to strengthen the role of the Union as a key player on the world stage. So: sustainable development, European citizenship and the role of the Union in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress one aspect of the first point. Since the internal market is for the most part already in place, we need to incorporate related policies in the broader context of a growth strategy. This is a very important proposal, which changes the hierarchy in the Union budget: we are now in a position to promote the competitiveness of European businesses by exploiting the fact that they are already operating in a market with no internal borders. I must repeat that there is only one way to increase competitiveness: through quality, technological development, research and innovation; in a broader sense, the absolute priority is investment in human resources. This is the unifying point, the major change in this financial proposal. It is absolutely essential that we devise a common strategy at European level to link up our research centres and to produce the best scientists and the best academics in the world. Europe and the world of education needs to be opened up to life-long learning. We have the tradition, we have the ability, we have the infrastructure; it is now up to Europe to invest all the necessary economic and political resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the second point, I have often said that, even now, our citizens may sometimes feel that they have split loyalties: to their city, to their nation, to Europe. One of our objectives will be to put the principle of European citizenship into practice. The Union must work together with the national governments to guarantee the same level of human rights, security, protection and quality of life across its territory. This involves the fight against crime and terrorism; it involves the joint management of external borders and of migratory flows that takes into account the human dignity of the immigrants and considers them to be a valuable resource for our economy and our society. It involves, finally, developing services of general interest that are the backbone of our social model, such as health, food safety, education, energy and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, now the Union’s final borders are being outlined, the time has come to picture a real European identity. This will be the new frontier in the decades to come. There will probably not be any geographical advances, but there will certainly be progress on the spiritual front. We must, therefore, also work to encourage creativity and exchanges in the fields of culture, the arts, literature and methods of mass communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the role of the European Union in the world, enlargement and the prospect of the complete unification of our continent, Europe will really be able to become a force for stability and a reference point across the world. The time has, however, come to shoulder the responsibilities that this entails in a mature way. Firstly, we must assume a clear responsibility at regional level by implementing the Commission strategy to develop a circle of friendly countries. Over the next few years, we must develop this neighbourhood policy to share projects and policies with our neighbours and to guarantee peace and stability by spreading greater prosperity and our founding principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibility does, however, go beyond our role at regional level. Europe must maintain and increase its contribution to growth, because the gap in opportunities and living conditions between the North and South of the world is incompatible with our political, civil and human traditions. This state of affairs is also not in our interests, and it increases the irregular migratory flows that so alarm our citizens. The Union must, therefore, continue to encourage dialogue, peaceful solutions and multilateral approaches. We must find a single voice on the world stage, with the ultimate objective of having a joint representation in assemblies such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. All over the world there are people that see in us a hope for peace and a wise and balanced force. We cannot disappoint these expectations; we must overcome our differences and, together, propose the model that we have fine-tuned in the course of 50 years of the Union’s existence.</p>
<p class="contents">These, ladies and gentlemen, are just some of the many objectives contained in our Communication. To achieve them all, as we are constantly being called on to do, we need a far larger budget than that which we have been given up to now. Nevertheless, the Commission is realistic, extremely realistic. We have worked meticulously for a whole year– involving six groups of Commissioners and all of the College on several occasions in various seminars, and also all the Directorate Generals and every government – and the materials for this huge amount of preparatory work will be published on the Internet, if you want, and are able, to use them to make it possible to have a more detailed debate. We have analysed, assessed, taken decisions and arranged for reforms. We have decided, not without difficulty, to remain within the current ceiling of the Union’s own resources, in other words 1.24% of European GDP, plus the ACP (EDF) cooperation funds that have to be entered into the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on this basis that we have acted with rigour, determination and clear intent to review expenditure which, by limiting payments to an average of 1.15% of GDP, leaves us sufficient margin to be able to work calmly. We are convinced that, even if it is certainly not sufficient to achieve the objectives sought by the Member States – and put to us unanimously by the Member States – it will be possible, with a sum of this size, to achieve specific results. Indeed, we are concerned not just with numbers but also with the effectiveness of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not confine ourselves to justifying the need for resources, but we are also setting out a new structure to use them in a better and more rational way. This means continuing to improve the administrative culture and governance of the European Union. If, in fact, we maintain, on the one hand, that, in a large number of cases, action at European level is necessary and more effective, the Commission plans, on the other hand, to involve other bodies to rationalise the implementation of our measures on the ground. In particular, the partnership with the Member States is a relationship involving the ever more active mobilisation of the regions and local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are working on greatly simplifying the instruments that are currently used. To give you just one example, we propose to reduce the measures currently used in the field of external relations from more than 100 to six, each one dedicated to a specific political and operational area.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that I am presenting to you today is not a technical accounting document; it is a political declaration and I ask you to look at it as such. It aims to provide the operational framework for managing the major changes to the Union in future years. The Commissioners, the Commission departments and myself have devoted ourselves to the task with energy and enthusiasm, and I am sure that you will not fail to see this energy and enthusiasm fully reflected in the results of our work. These pages are, for the Commission, a major expression of renewed trust in Europe and its institutions. We now hand them over for Parliament and the Council to analyse, and I would be happy if, for you too, they were also a message full of hope and realism for our future.</p>

The first concerns the amounts necessary to meet the aspirations of everyone who wants to see a successful Europe in the future – whether that ceiling should be 1% of GNI, or 1.24%, or somewhere in between – and to remind everyone that today is the start of what will probably be a 12-month process.

<p class="contents">In December Mr Colom i Naval, who is the rapporteur on the financial perspectives, presented a working document in the Committee on Budgets on the appraisal of the financial perspectives from their inception in 1988 to 2002. Over those 15 years, the average budget implementation is, remarkably, 1% of GDP. The Council could say that is sufficient, but to get an average of 1% over those years means we have to spend above 1% in certain years. In fact, we spent up to the figure mentioned by Mr Prodi – 1.15% – in 1993. My point is that this type of flexibility is needed if we are to continue to have a decent average. If that average has to be 1%, then there will be years when we will have to exceed 1% quite significantly. I am still not sure whether the Council's figure of 1% includes the EDF. I do not think it does, but that would therefore make it 1.03% at best.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a comment to those Member States which criticised the Stability Pact for being too rigid. They should also see that if there is a case for flexibility in the Stability Pact, then we do not need rigidity in the European Union budget by sticking at 1%, as some Member States propose. That has been shown in Category 4, where, without the flexibility instrument, we could not have financed the actions in Kosovo, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq or in other areas. We need that flexibility in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking in a personal capacity, we could manage within the 1% if those same Member States had not already agreed that agricultural expenditure should be set in concrete up to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I quote from the Commission's document: 'A ceiling around 1% of GNI would fail to meet the European Council<span class="italic"> </span>commitments on agricultural payments, would undermine the phasing-in of cohesion policy in the ten new Member States and would jeopardise existing levels of other policies.' It goes on to say: 'Alternatively, cuts would be needed across the board and existing agreements would have to be reopened, including the amounts decided at the Brussels European Council of October 2002.' I hope the Council takes cognisance of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is specifically to the Council. To get an agreement on the new financial perspectives needs an interinstitutional agreement. I just want to remind the Council that we are one of those institutions, and it will need Parliament's agreement to get an interinstitutional agreement. We do not care if we do not get it: we will just go back to Article 272 of the Treaty and will still manage the budget without the Council's say-so. That is not a threat, it is just a comment to the Council, which it should bear in mind as we go through this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that for almost the past 15 years – all the time I have been in this Parliament and on the Committee on Budgets – the rapporteur for the financial perspectives has been Mr Colom i Naval. This will probably be his last plenary session – I am breaking news here. He will be offered the job of head of the Court of Auditors in the Catalan Government, and no doubt will be taking it up very shortly.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to his unceasing work; he knows more about this subject than anyone else – dare I say, boringly so! He can quote the interinstitutional agreement chapter and verse, but I have been glad of it on many occasions. I want to thank him for all his work over those 15 years, and also wish him well for his new post. I hope I express the whole of Parliament's wish in that sentiment.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, we welcome the debate this afternoon. As the Commission President has announced, this is a Commission decision already, and to come first to us in the Parliament is always an agreeable thing so far as budgetary matters are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">First, from my Group's perspective, we will be taking the view that Mr Wynn has just expressed: we would rather be very prudent about whether we need the financial perspectives at all. We had multiannual agreements which keep discipline, which we did not have before the financial perspectives were introduced. We do not wish guidelines – which is what financial perspectives are – to become an end in themselves. We should recall very clearly as we go through this discussion that we have the right under Article 272 of the existing Treaty – not necessarily under the Constitutional Treaty but the existing Treaty – to be able to continue the budget process, and we shall therefore be very careful to see that parliamentary rights are properly safeguarded in the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if there is to be a financial perspective, we welcome the ideas that the President has put forward today about better flexibility, categorisation and looking ahead to how money will be properly spent. Let us be clear that there will not be any decision in this Parliament about the final nature of this financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to take inspiration from Mr Colom i Naval's advice and knowledge of this. You and I, Joan, had a common view about the last financial perspective and I sense it is very clear that we have a shared view on this one, particularly regarding the length of the financial perspective. We have made it very clear, in Mr Wynn's resolution and in our own Group documents, that we do not want a financial perspective to go beyond the term of office of the next Commission, because how can one possibly justify in democratic terms that we are deciding for future parliaments and for future Commissions? We should stick to the term of office of the next Commission, which is five years. To suggest a date after 2013 is to suggest that an old parliament will be committing a new parliament after 2014; it does not work. We will have to come to terms with that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thought is that now we are going to have enlargement – 25 countries – we know the difficulties will be very great in managing a European Union. Does this financial perspective address Turkey in any way? Or will that be an additional expenditure? Should you decide in December 2004 to start negotiations? For many in my political group, and maybe across the Parliament, to start full negotiations with a country when you do not even know what your existing financial capacity is – to run a union for 25 countries in this way – would be extraordinarily inept and irresponsible, because we need to know what the basis will be when we are negotiating with a country of that size.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in conclusion, please let us avoid, when we come to decisions on this, a Soviet-style approach to planning which is going to take us too far into the future of our commitments. Secondly, let us make sure that it is properly democratic and let us not take decisions which we will regret later because we have taken on countries for which we do not have the financial capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me a few moments to thank the Chairman of the Committee for his kind words and to express my thanks for your kind words and the applause and congratulations I have received from many of my colleagues who came here today knowing that this would probably be my last speech to the Assembly from these benches.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that for someone who started their political career in the anti-fascist underground, at the age of 18, the opportunity to be here in the European Parliament has been an unforgettable experience. I look on my 18 years in the European Parliament as a privilege and I would like to thank all of my colleagues, the Bureau, and in particular my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and all of the officials and co-workers with whom I have worked during this time.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you miss me, in any event, my new role does not allow me to be paid, as you know, so I can advise you ‘free of charge’. Having said that, allow me to move on to the topic in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">For the last time as rapporteur for the financial perspective, I can say that at last we have the promised Commission communication on one of the key issues affecting the European Union in the years ahead. Until very recently, last Friday in fact, we only knew of it by means of press leaks and rough drafts and had had practically no official notification of it until the tripartite dialogue held in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s speeches, and especially that of Mr Prodi, have given us a more positive image than the text we had seen to date, with which I disagreed due to some of its apocalyptic tones. In my opinion, we have to have a more positive vision and I think that that must be our approach to addressing the problems and proposals for action in order to ensure economic growth in the Union in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid, however, that once again we are beginning to build the house from the roof down or, to be more precise, from the ceiling down. We are starting <span class="italic">a priori</span>, <span class="italic">ex ante</span>, from a maximum ceiling for the budget within which we are trying to fit the policies, rather than looking at the policies and the funding they require and determining the extent to which the resources needed to finance them are available.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, the Commission has to some extent fallen into the trap of ‘the gang of six’: the Treasury Ministers who call themselves ‘net contributors’, who have proposed staying within 1% of the ceiling for the financial perspective. I believe that the most fundamental negotiating tactic required us to go further than that and to be more ambitious, and not to stay within the limits set by the Commission – itself and the budget authorities – in 1992 to meet the needs of a European Community that at that stage had 12 members. That is the percentage they want us to retain. I think it shows a lack of ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to increase the competitiveness of the economy, fulfil the Lisbon objectives, maintain the cohesion policy, finance enlargement, and solve the statistical problems concerning the flows to the poorest regions of the current 15 Member States. We want to have a foreign policy, a security policy, perhaps a defence policy too, an R&amp;D policy, and so on, but where will the money come from? I feel it is important that at last the proposal to include a European tax has been included, but still…</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves whether or not these figures are hiding reductions in the so-called political priorities and – I stress – agriculture and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we should all remind the Commission and the Council that because of the Council’s systematic refusal, the perspectives have not been included in the Treaty until now. Therefore, until the Constitution enters into force in the terms approved by the Convention, we are under no obligation to sign this agreement or to approve any package for the financial perspective. I hope that the Irish Presidency takes note of this with a view to moving the Constitution forward as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into any further detail regarding the duration, but I would like to raise a couple of technical questions. What are the consequences of reducing the number of headings to five but increasing the number of subheadings? What rules govern the transfer of money or appropriations from one subheading to another? If we have a financial perspective, what form will the flexibility mechanism take exactly? Moreover, we have a figure of 1.24% but it is vital to clarify the concepts of payment appropriations, commitment appropriations, and the vague reference to gross domestic product, gross national product and to gross national income. These are questions that, I should mention in passing, could mean a difference of EUR 7 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the progress of European integration in a united and enlarged Europe requires generosity and a broad-minded approach, and it seems that our ambitions far outnumber resources.</p>

But in their rush to advance their own interests, the Member States are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats and Reformers believe that governments should first, as the admirable Mr Colom i Naval has suggested, take a long, hard look at what they have asked the European Union to do, and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job. Governments should also ruthlessly tackle waste and fraud, most of which occur at national level, and target spending on our priorities to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain, France, Germany and three other states have formed an unholy alliance, united only by their zeal to keep down their budget contributions. Even putting aside the wider benefits that the European Union buys, the EU needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities. This year we will integrate ten new Member States. Europe is charged with important new responsibilities abroad, and with the task of keeping us safe from crime and terrorism at home. Reviving growth requires progress on the ambitious reform agenda of Lisbon. Do the six states really expect the EU to do all of this on 1% of Europe's gross national income?</p>
<p class="contents">With spending set to reach 1.11% of GNI in 2006, a ceiling of 1% in 2007 means not recalibration but cuts. None of these Member States can tell us where the axe will fall. Indeed, I would wager that they cannot even agree among themselves. My warning to Europe's citizens would be <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span>: buyer beware! These are the same governments who agreed in 2002 to a 1% annual increase in spending on the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If Member States demonstrated a real willingness to reform the CAP further, it would be easier to take seriously their calls for parsimony. As it is, we are running this Union on just over 1% of the gross national income of the Member States, when the budget of the Federal Government in the United States is 20% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to strive for savings where possible, but also equip the Union to meet the objectives we have set ourselves. My Group believes that the key to better value lies in a modest budget increase, leaving a safe margin for unforeseen expenditure, linked to reform, less waste and more intelligent investment. Not promises of smarter spending from Member States with no will to deliver it.</p>

All too often this short-sighted policy has caused us to abandon an area that is deemed to be crucial one day in favour of another area that is deemed of vital importance the next. It is by robbing Peter to pay Paul that we have, on average, survived on a derisory budget. In 2004 this reached a historic low, below 1% of GDP, which is 20% less than the ceiling on which the Fifteen had themselves agreed for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement on the horizon, this short-term vision of the Union’s responsibilities is now creating a potentially explosive situation. If the six Member States that are net contributors to the European budget actually go ahead with their plan to freeze expenditure at current levels from 2007, many fine promises will go up in smoke! The major works projects, rather hastily baptised the ‘growth initiative’, risk being buried once again. As for regional and social aid and the appropriations for the Cohesion Fund, they will melt away like snow in the sun for the majority of their current beneficiaries and many of their future recipients. Farewell cohesion! Farewell solidarity! On a social level this is known as cynicism; on a political level we call it irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I might have severe words for the Member States concerned, but this does not mean that I am awarding any plaudits to the Commission. Your communication, Mr President of the Commission, is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs. Where is your previous ambition, although there is clearly more to responding to the challenge of ensuring the balanced development of an enlarged European Union than just increasing the financial perspective by one or two tenths of a per cent of GDP? I would remind you that by 2007 the Union’s population will have increased by a third. The income of our new Members is less than half that of the Fifteen and, from many points of view, I do not think that the famous acquis communautaire is doing them any favours. I therefore remain unsatisfied, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the Commission’s position is not without its contradictions. On the one hand, it legitimately expects a number of Member States to increase their net contribution to the Community budget, but on the other it pushes the cult of limiting public expenditure so far as to take the Council of Ministers to court for not respecting the Stability Pact. Polite requests or punishment: you have a choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, many problems remain outstanding. I will mention just one: the regions that in the future will essentially be deprived of benefiting from the Structural Funds, despite the fact that there has been no significant change in their situation. Quite simply, the arrival of poorer regions in the Union will automatically – I would say bureaucratically – lower the threshold for becoming eligible for these funds. It is understandable that the forthcoming negotiations are giving serious cause for concern more or less everywhere. These are all symptoms of what to me is looking increasingly like a crisis in the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">After the split on the war in Iraq, the ‘stupid’ affair of the Stability Pact and the breakdown of the Brussels Summit on the Constitution, we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are. It would appear to be absolutely essential to re-found Europe. Faced with the risk of a dangerous wave of disenchantment amongst the public, as I see it our only hope is to be found in the growing call for a new kind of Europe. The coming months will be decisive in determining whether a beautiful utopia is waxing or waning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives us, as Parliament, as well as the national governments, plenty of opportunity for listing our priorities for the next few years. After all, the budget is, logically, the financial translation of the policy that we want – nothing more, nothing less. In this respect, I should really like to congratulate the Commission. It is trying, in an honest and courageous manner, to point out the cost of the content of the plans made by the European Heads of Government and also of the Commission itself over the past few years. In my opinion, the Commission is, in this sense, much more honest than the six net contributors who, last December, said that they would pay not one cent more than they are doing now. In that sense, I share in the critical attitude of my fellow MEPs. One per cent and not one cent more, irrespective of enlargement, irrespective of the need for Europe to play a more prominent role in the world, irrespective of plans for European border control and irrespective of the promise to turn Europe into the world's most dynamic knowledge economy: plans of this kind are always announced with much pomp and circumstance, but at the end of the day, Member States refuse to accept the implications. More tasks for the European Union, certainly a larger European Union, will also require more money. I would like to urge you to put your money where your plans are.</p>
<p class="contents">Current expenditure, too, could also, of course, be held up to the light. Cutbacks could definitely be made there, and my group would be willing to talk about this. The problem, though, is that those very six countries that are fixated on this one per cent also refuse to discuss further reforms with regard to the European budget's biggest debit item, namely agricultural policy. It is a policy that is still massively rewarding farmers and is detrimental to animals and the environment. The net contributors refuse to talk about this for reasons that are beyond me. It is time we started talking not only about the amount involved or about what Mr Prodi said about the roof of the house, but also about a really useful way of spending the citizens' tax money. In this respect, I have numerous doubts regarding the Commission's proposal. It wants to set aside a great deal of money under the heading of sustainable development, which is fine – it touches my green heart. However, what exactly is so sustainable about the proposals you have formulated? The Commission has developed a whole strategy to stimulate research, but why has this not been done for the environment? Why have all the plans to make agriculture greener by stimulating rural development at the expense of intensive agricultural production been abandoned? Why is there not more funding for rural development?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also very ambitious when it comes to foreign policy. The ties with the new neighbouring countries must be strengthened and Europe must play an important role globally. My group welcomes this. This role also requires an idea about how, for example, future international crises should be paid for, which is what is currently lacking. Mr Wynn also made the point that, if there is no flexibility in the European budget, then there is the risk that the bill will always be at the expense of other policy measures. Accordingly, the bill will, for example, eventually have to be paid by our new neighbours, while we are, in fact, trying to strengthen those ties. More flexibility also with regard to foreign policy is really something that is yet to be incorporated into the Commission’s plans. I look forward to hearing more about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like, however, to thank the President of the Commission for having reached an agreement, albeit an incomplete one. That being said, I must, as a young Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, certainly be anxious and express my fears for agriculture, culture, the TEN projects, technology, research, the universities and all the programmes that we launched and announced so enthusiastically. I believe that, in view of the imminent enlargement to the East, we cannot definitely say – and, above all, the Council cannot say – that this is a major agreement. We can simply say that it is a watered-down agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Colom i Naval, whom I thank for his contribution, Mr Wynn and also the President of the Commission will be able to support a young man like myself when I say that I would like to recall the words of a great personality, Ignazio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. He said that he feared the day when no one fought him any longer. Well, I think that we must all fight with this same spirit to see a Europe that is certainly stronger, but one that develops more and is able to have more resources for our projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is aimed at Commissioner Schreyer, who wants EU spending to reach up to the ceiling of 1.24% of the Gross National Product. This proposal is unrealistic from the outset, given that six net contributors want to restrict the EU budget to 1%. The past decades have shown that subsidies for regional policy hardly have any impact, except in Ireland. It is therefore surprising that the Commission should propose to increase this item by 23%. Has the Commissioner ever heard of subsidy addiction? We propose an automatic restriction of the net revenue of the Member States that enjoy a level of prosperity above 90% of the European average. Annually, they should not receive more than 1% net of the Gross Domestic Product. This would give the necessary breathing space for the much poorer regions in the acceding countries. It is likely that structural policy in those countries is also more effective. The fifty-fifty distribution between old and new Member States, as now proposed by Commissioner Barnier, is a stab in the dark. Given the narrow margins in national budgets, little political realism is shown by the decision to spend money on tarting up a European institution that will, at best, be a replica of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">One proposal meets with our approval. It concerns the introduction of a general correction mechanism for Member States that contribute excessive amounts to the funding of the European Union. For the rest, we would ask the Commissioner for multi-annual budgets that, instead of stating more of the same, offer real priorities and realistic, viable options. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, it is certainly important to support such an approach. As others have stressed, however, at this stage in the European debate – where it is so threatened by tendencies always to want to do more as well as to want to scrimp and save – the Commission should have gone a step further.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the Commission and its Sapir report, we know how much we really need to change the priorities of our investments and our budget to be competitive and to give Europe the hopes and objectives that Mr Prodi referred to. The Sapir report has, however, remained in a draw because it worries many people and many governments who do not want to hear talk of certain issues.</p>
<p class="contents">So, at a time when the Commission has got into the habit of touching on sensitive issues, as it did with the Stability and Growth Pact, there is, for example, this agreement, which seems to be set in stone and which, while we are discussing the CAP, we are committed to not touching until 2013. This issue should, then, have been included in today’s communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, that is the context surrounding this Commission communication, in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances. This Commission communication will have to be supplemented by the own-initiative report to be prepared by Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and adapt to the new circumstances of enlargement; the European elections will produce a new Parliament and there will be a new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we must welcome the Commission’s work and the new budget headings: sustainable development, putting the people at the heart of our project and boosting a more visible and effective foreign policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight very clearly the alternative put to us by President Prodi of choosing between two models of Europe. He told us that between the tangible Europe, the definite Europe, and the Europe of the net balance and net beneficiary, he chose a model compatible with the former, which is a higher model, a model of the Europe of values, the Europe of peace, of understanding, of harmony and of solidarity. This solidarity must go hand in hand with the Lisbon spirit and strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I welcome the strategic choice made by the Commission today to present a communication that is not based on a model of a selfish Europe but on a model that has been capable of making the figures work for the ideals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, President Prodi, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are embarking today on a debate whose preparation in recent weeks has already been accompanied by a great deal of shadow-boxing, and I am pleased that the proposals are finally on the table so we can talk about them. I am not so lacking in self-confidence that I feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting. Nor do I feel any need to be bound solely by the Commission’s proposals, just as I see little reason to take the individual statements from the Council or parts of the Council as a benchmark for myself. Instead, as Members of this Parliament, which is one of the institutions to vote on this financial perspective, we will address these issues over the coming weeks and months, and indeed over the coming years – that is how long such difficult discussions can take. In doing so, it is not acceptable for one side to say: ‘We have an idea and we want a vast amount of cash to implement it’. That cannot be the right approach. However, the other side also cannot say: ‘Look, you have a bit of cash in Europe, see how far you get with that’. Both of these approaches are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is what we have to do. We must face up to the challenges that we are already discussing jointly, and then work through them point by point. Let me say this: all of us – including those who have been regaling us with grand words today – will have to be flexible on a number of issues. We will have to discuss what we want to do in the field of research and development. At our last session, we agreed that 3% of gross domestic product should be spent on this policy area in Europe. This 3% cannot be accommodated in the budget, for then the 1.24% or 1.0% or whatever would not be worth the paper it is written on. We therefore need to talk about budget combinations. We must discuss what should be done at national level in the Member States in future, and we must discuss what we can best do jointly at European level. We need to do this in all the areas before us. That includes foreign policy, for example, where the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget; we will integrate it. We will also have to discuss what proportion of international conflict prevention we want to fund from the European budget and what the Member States will cover in future. We have adopted a figure of 0.7% of GDP as a guide here. As regards justice and home affairs, we will have to discuss whether we want to maintain Europol and Eurojust as small units, as at present, or whether we are aiming for further development here. Another question is how much of the fight against organised crime should be funded at European level and what should be funded at local level. All these issues will have to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have to talk about what comes under each budget heading and which proportion is paid from which budget. I am very flexible here, and I am approaching this debate with an open mind. I believe this is essential, for otherwise – especially given the war-cries now resounding through the corridors – it will be impossible to create the right atmosphere for a substantive joint debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have found some good things in the proposals you have presented. We will be looking at them. We will of course be discussing with you why the proposed duration of the financial perspective is seven years. It is important to highlight the fact that this may result in a Parliament such as this one – as Mr Elles has said – being excluded completely from the debate about the funding of the European Union’s future. A seven-year period could produce that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will need to talk about the growth rates that you have taken as a basis for your financial calculations. I think I saw at one point that you are assuming economic growth of 4.5% per annum. If we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in Europe, we will have no problem with any aspect of funding. We therefore need to discuss which statistics you are taking as a basis for your overall figures.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to discuss the structure you are proposing, and whether it is transparent, efficient and flexible. Our interest in reforming agricultural policy also means that we want to invest in the development of rural regions within the framework of general agricultural policy. Is this possible, based on your proposals? Or will we have new hurdles to overcome yet again in a new financial perspective – hurdles which cannot be overcome? We need some measure of flexibility because as several other speakers have said, challenges will arise over a seven-year period which we cannot predict today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that we, in this House, should engage in this discussion with self-confidence. We have our own ideas and we will set out our vision of the Europe we want to achieve. We will talk about the resources to be deployed for this purpose. I look forward to our discussions with you. I also look forward to the discussions with the Council. Both of you will have to deal with a self-confident but serious and solid Parliament.</p>

The EU is lagging behind all our main competitors in the areas of economic growth and competitiveness, and that is why financial investment in the prerequisites for growth is the right and necessary area of focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Research, the encouragement of innovation and the adoption of high technology are promoters of growth. So is a high-level infrastructure. Investment in transport and energy networks will immediately create new jobs and strengthen business conditions even in remote regions and those where development has fallen behind. The EU, including its most peripheral areas, must be taken account of in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, investment in the young is crucial. Programmes of education and training must be extended and diversified for youth to be able to acclimatise more readily to an international working environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem and priority is Structural and Cohesion policy. The new Member States need support for reconstruction and for strengthening their economic environment. This cannot be allowed to happen, however, at the expense of the economically frailer regions of the old Member States. That is why the provision of funds has to be increased on an equivalent scale.</p>
<p class="contents">If the development promised under the financial framework is to succeed, the administration has to be thoroughly modernised. The reform of the Commission carried out this term is only a basis for reforms. Power and responsibility have to be devolved both within the bureaucratic machinery and from the Commission to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of its fundamental pillars is social and territorial cohesion, in other words, making all citizens genuinely equal by combating imbalances and inequalities in existing wealth and opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In two months’ time the Union is going to be enlarged with the accession of 10 new Member States and some 75 million citizens. Its wealth will be far below the current average of the Europe of Fifteen and if we hope to continue to maintain our two-fold Community objective, if we hope to overcome the inequalities suffered by these new Europeans, we cannot contemplate allocating fewer public resources to this end; rather, we should step up our efforts to help.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual Community expenditure, payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income, while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation. In other words, we are allocating fewer resources to developing the Community, and yet there are some, such as the signatories to the well-known ‘letter of the six’, who want to reduce them even further.</p>

I do not intend at this time to state whether or not the financial perspective proposed here by the Commission represents percentage gains for one country or another. This is not the reason for my intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, in this context, we must not forget that those countries that intend to enjoy Community funds as of 2007 have yet to meet their biggest challenges: they must overcome their structural backwardness and must ensure the economic and social cohesion of their populations. I therefore prefer to concentrate on the political significance of the Commission’s proposal. If the Commission maintains or, should I say, takes the risk of maintaining, the level of financial resources of the EU at 1.24% of the Community’s gross national product until 2013, it would be making a decisive investment in the European policy of solidarity, as the only means of achieving the homogenous growth of the entire EU, in the wake of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are integrating ten new countries, this must be a prime objective, to which the benefiting countries, be they old or new, must respond with the ability to carry out the crucial reforms implied and presupposed by European solidarity. Parliament has therefore no choice but to offer political support to the Commission’s proposal. We must also do all we can to ensure that the proposal of the six wealthiest Member States – to reduce the Community budget from 1.24% to 1% of Europe’s GNP – is not allowed to triumph. We must, therefore, criticise in the strongest terms those politicians who utter fine words on Europe and solidarity, but whose real priorities lie in preserving national interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For 25 years, I have tried to obtain detailed information about how the EU uses the money we pay in quotas. There has still, for example, been no success in tracking down the ‘skimmed milk supremo’ who, for many years, was the biggest recipient of EU subsidies in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">We have still not seen statements of account from the secret accounts in the Eurostat scandal. We know, however, that the chief accountant, Marta Andreasen, who insisted on correct accounts, has now been suspended for 17 months and is banned from showing herself in the Commission’s buildings, where those who have manifestly been responsible for the fraud can go about freely. This state of affairs does not provide the necessary permission for sending funds via Brussels. The June Movement instead proposes that the EU focus on the cross-border matters we cannot solve ourselves and keep away from everything else.</p>
<p class="contents">The subsidies to the present EU agricultural systems can be phased out by 20% per year over five years. The EU should completely cease giving structural aid to the rich Member States. The poor countries and the new Member States should be exempted from paying quotas so that there is real solidarity and not only a redistribution from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poorer countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With such a reform, the net payers will get away with paying less tax, at the same time as the net recipients will be in a significantly better position than at present. At the same time, allow details of each appropriation and item of expenditure to be accessible on the Internet. In that way, we can avoid waste, excess and fraud, and vigilant journalists and employees in companies and other institutions that receive subsidies will quickly be able to reveal if money is being misused, wasted or misappropriated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just a few round figures. Last year, Denmark paid DKK 15 billion in EU quotas. Danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of DKK 10 billion. The total net income received by Danish agriculture was only a fraction of the direct EC subsidy. Money is flooding out of EU coffers without ending up in the hands of the needy farmers, and this shows, more than any amount of words, the need for a halt to expenditure and tax, including in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when the net contributors do not have unlimited resources at their disposal and net recipients are keen to protect their vested interests, it will be difficult to achieve a constructive solution. As this solution, the Commission is proposing an increase in own resources. The idea of granting the EU its own tax competence – the keyword is the ‘Europe tax’ – is being discussed. Given the difficult economic situation and massive austerity measures being applied in numerous EU Member States, the letter from the six governments is quite understandable, in my view. If savings are being made across the board, then the EU cannot – no, esteemed colleagues – must not shy away from this desire for savings and reform. Anything else would damage the future of the EU and would ultimately be impossible to justify to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conflict over the EU’s future finances, there are two options: either to carry on muddling through, repeating the sins of the past and trying to fund everything at once, or – the second option – to see the future framework for the EU budget as an opportunity. Ever since the decision to admit ten new Member States, at the latest, it has been clear that reforms are essential. Yet so far, no one has been willing to grasp the nettle. Is everything just fine in the EU’s subsidy policy, for example? Is it clear why the EU subsidises tobacco cultivation while banning tobacco advertising at the same time? Is it really the clever option to fund the transportation of animals right across our continent and beyond?</p>
<p class="contents">These are just two minor examples. However, one thing is clear: reforms must happen, and this is an opportunity. It takes political courage and probably also a political vision of Europe’s future shape, tasks and prospects. After all, a budget is merely a set of policies presented in numerical form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To this end, we need to spend less, but spend better. Reform is therefore necessary, not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the ‘sprinkling’ approach that we have adopted so far, but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the expectations of the public means quite simply, for example in employment policy, not having any more of these policies of providing secondary assistance or patching up the crutches that are already available. Because if we want to create 15 million jobs, we will need to innovate under the Lisbon Agenda and implement new policies that are original and dynamic and that foster private initiative. We will need to educate, inform the public, pursue these policies that we have started to implement, policies that generate jobs, and in addition accelerate structural reforms. We will need to promote investment in infrastructure, in transport, in communications, in human resources and in research, which is still being left out in the cold and whose budget is in my view far from adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us nevertheless bear in mind that all of this should meet an objective of sustainable development, a factor in creating stability. And let us refrain from making scapegoats of certain groups of society, such as our poor farmers, because we really do need them and they need us.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we find the proposals that the Commission has made to us reassuring, and I would particularly like to welcome the proposals for the new regional policy put forward by Commissioner Barnier. The choice that has been made seems to me to be an excellent one, because it will provide the enlargement countries with the necessary support without isolating the regions in the current Member States that need these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We must actually continue to meet the needs of the areas covered by the present fifteen Member States, fostering their competitiveness and growth so as to fight against unemployment. Were we not to do so then the public would simply not understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, sustainable development in the Member States must be supported and the role of the European Union as global partner must be strengthened. In addition, the new financial perspective must send out a clear political message about equal treatment and solidarity between the Member States and, if you will allow me to dwell on this point, the needs of the regions which suffer the repercussions of so-called 'statistical convergence'.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens in these developing regions see political cohesion as the main element in making the idea of the European Union a worthy idea and I do not agree at all with the view heard in this Chamber that there are no beneficial results from this policy. At the same time, the citizens in these regions wanted and agreed to the extensive enlargement which will be completed in a few weeks' time. Morally and politically, therefore, it is fair for these citizens not to lose so much that they lose the feeling of solidarity which they have had to date, enjoying its fruits. Clearly, there must be a smooth withdrawal of Community aid from these regions, with a transitional period in which support is wound down.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital during this period to safeguard adequate funding. Any thoughts of making reductions, especially large reductions, in appropriations which, it can be presumed, would have devolved upon these regions without enlargement, jeopardise the efficacy of the political cohesion which is under way and, consequently, must be treated as harmful to the credibility of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have two doubts, which I am sure you will be able to solve: first of all, I come from a long history of militancy in a party that must surely remind you of something, and during that time I have learned that too much realism in politics often means the start of conflict. It seems to me that your request to freeze at 1.24%, that is to say at the current level, the amount of GDP allocated – an allocation which, inter alia, is still based on 12 countries, whereas we are now 25 and will probably continue to expand – is a position lacking not only in ambition but also in courage, and I base that criticism on two facts. Firstly, we have just approved a quick start programme for public works designed to relaunch the idea of Europe and the single market, in which we need the Member States to be involved and to provide resources, which is why I find it extremely difficult to understand the position of the six Member States that have called for a reduction in the amount allocated. Secondly, in any negotiations, sticking to a position knowing that some of the Member States do not agree with the reference to 1%, appears to me to be quite a complex negotiating position from a tactical point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The second doubt concerns the timing. The current financial situation is programmed up to the end of 2006; the Commission must present a proposal before July 2005 and the agreement must be reached before May 2006. So then, why the urgency? So that we can rush things through in a Parliament whose mandate is about to expire? As Mr Wynn correctly pointed out, our Parliament has an extremely important role to play, but that role will be played by the Parliament to be elected on 13 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, the letter from the six governments so soon after the collapse of the Summit was a mistake in terms of its timing, tone and content and was therefore quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, however, in response to the Commission’s ideas – and you, President Prodi, have presented some interesting keywords, although we will have to discuss them in far more detail – I must say that what is urgently required in the coming months is a critical review of the European Union’s agenda, with a focus on both positive and negative aspects across the board in all policy fields, if we want to identify honest and practical responses for Europe’s citizens. Naturally, the outcome of our discussions today cannot be binding on the new Commission, which will still have to be approved by the new Parliament; nor can it be binding in any way on the new Parliament in its capacity as part of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this more critical approach, however, it is essential, first and foremost, to complete the constitutional treaty and define the system of powers, also in line with the subsidiarity principle. This also means that if powers are transferred back to the Member States in an enlarged EU, we will need fewer resources for these areas at European level. However, it also means that if tasks are transferred to the European level – such as foreign, security and development policy – the Member States will have to look again at the possibility of not only increasing the EU budget but also reducing spending at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by raising two points. After all, it is not just a matter of freeing up budget funds in order to deal with new objectives, improving competitiveness and growth potential. What I think is missing, especially in the light of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy to be discussed next month, is that here, the Commission itself has not established the coherence on many legislative proposals, which is necessary to achieve the binding consolidation that will generate growth potential and entrepreneurial freedoms throughout the European Union. If what you are proposing in the budget is flanked by such initiatives, our credibility will be much improved.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we see the option of reverting to Article 272 of the Treaty without binding new Parliaments and new institutions as a very exciting one.</p>

It will not be this Commission or this Parliament that take the final decisions, but here is the result and we must thank the entire College of Commissioners for having incorporated the various sensibilities. We consider this to be a good basis for negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">A financial perspective that is properly negotiated among the three institutions is a vital element for the rational development of the Union’s expenditure and for ensuring growth, competitiveness, employment, and economic and social cohesion within a framework of budgetary stability. That is the financial perspective on which this Parliament would like to vote. We would never vote in favour of a financial perspective based simply on accounting calculations or imposed unilaterally by one institution that had not negotiated with the others.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has already set out its position on three aspects of the financial perspective. The first of those was its duration, which in principle should coincide where possible with the duration of the mandates of the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have also stated our support for providing greater impetus for the political objectives laid down in Lisbon and Gothenburg. This development takes shape through the Union’s annual budgets and it is clear that without sufficient financial resources there can be no credible objectives. Indeed, look at the 2005 draft budget and you will see what budget restrictions are.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have on many occasions expressed our support for a financial perspective that is capable of fulfilling the objective of cohesion. Cohesion is and will continue to be the major inspiration behind the EU’s policies along with growth and stability. The 0.45% of gross national income for cohesion measures has been incorporated by this Parliament and forms part of our approach. If we cut corners with cohesion policy we will surely fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President of the Commission will brief Coreper tomorrow, and on 23 February there will be a first discussion by ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim as presidency will be to initiate and advance discussions and, in cooperation with succeeding presidencies, to map out how best to process the dossier and lay a solid foundation for our successors. We hope in this regard that the spring European Council might be able to agree on the calendar and process for negotiations. The Council looks forward to working constructively with Parliament and the Commission in advancing this important dossier.</p>

<p class="contents">There has been one general criticism running through this debate – a debate for which I am sincerely grateful, because Parliament has genuinely exercised its institutional pride on the issue of the budget and has given us precious advice – criticism made by some important Members of Parliament, beginning with Mr Wynn: a lack of ambition, as Mr Fiori also pointed out, and the assertion that an excess of realism leads to weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I should like to point out that the structure of the budget we are presenting indicates a radical change with the past – not only quantitatively but also qualitatively; it constitutes an ambitious project that will give rise to serious problems and a fierce debate when the time comes for it to be adopted. I ask you to consider just a few figures: I have spoken about sustainable development; I did not want to provide analytical data because I believe that we need to consider such data together at some length, but in relation to the Lisbon process funds will increase by 62.8% – from EUR 47 billion in 2006 to EUR 76 billion in 2013 – allowing for a 32% increase in cohesion funds, 300% for funds earmarked for education and training, 200% for research funds, 400% for funds earmarked for competitiveness and networks. We have made choices that are coherent, precise and dramatically different from those of Lisbon: we have placed, within the context of an extremely ambitious draft budget, appropriations for the area of justice, which is one of the major areas of the Union – it was not by chance that I referred to it as one of the Union’s three lines of action – that is to say funds are to increase by almost 200% from EUR 1 billion in 2006 to EUR 3.6 billion in 2013. These, I repeat, are radical changes. Finally, the international situation: funds are to increase by almost 40% from EUR 11 billion in 2006 to EUR 15.7 billion in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">So then, we have made some stark choices – which I hope will be accepted – in keeping precisely in line with the objectives. We did not, ladies and gentlemen, begin building from the roof, but from the foundations, studying the new objectives and analysing what had been decided in previous years with the decisions taken at Lisbon and subsequent decisions. On this basis we have constructed a coherent budget so that Europe can relaunch itself, re-establish a united policy on justice and internal affairs and re-establish its voice in the world. There are three areas on which we have consolidated and focused our attention, and therefore this is a response which I consider ambitious; realistic and ambitious. I say realistic because it is clear that genuine situations, temperaments and even political trends cannot be ignored. I assure you that the procession of the six ambassadors who brought me the 1% letter resembled more than anything a funeral cortege, and it is clear that this makes no sense in a Europe that must react, that must go forward, that has enormous responsibilities for everyone. So, we have taken a major gamble: stark choices, extremely radical choices, as the detailed line by line analysis of the budget will show.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a final observation: why have we started so early, Mr Fiori? Out of respect for those who are to come after us. The timeframes are extremely long. When, at the end of our term of office, we hand over the whole project with its roadmap, when our work is completed, they will need – so it has been said – about twelve months, possibly more: going on past experience, 18 months will be needed to fine-tune the finished product; that means the beginning of 2006, January/February 2006. Care must be taken to provide enough time to learn the procedures, prepare the financing procedures and organise the financing structure, which is only just adequate, so that the objectives we have set ourselves can be met. The work we have carried out is wide-ranging but absolutely essential. It is clear that none of the decisions taken today will become operative under this term, we are well aware of that. It will be the new Parliament that will decide but, if we do not place the new Parliament in the position to decide, it will not be possible to make payments at the beginning of 2007. We have worked on this, Mr Fiori, because I can assure you of one thing: we never attempt to perform tasks that are not useful or are unnecessary. This has involved an enormous amount of work and perhaps we would willingly have avoided it had it not been for the benefit of the Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU faces major challenges and we must decide whether – and how – we, as a Community, will respond to these challenges. The objectives set jointly by the Member States are indeed very ambitious. By 2010, the EU is to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world; it is to become an area of freedom, security and justice. Europe is determined to take on more responsibility in the world, and we are about to embark on the historic reunification of the continent and the integration of the new EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspective establishes an important framework for decisions on the policies and tools that we will deploy to shape the future together. In order to achieve the ambitious objectives we have set ourselves and ensure that the Union can fulfil the growing expectations of its Member States and citizens, appropriate resources must be provided to underpin the policies. We should not raise expectations and then fail to deliver on the policies. That would generate disappointment among citizens. However, we should only provide European funding from the public purse for policies if we can state with confidence – as the President of the Commission has already said – that we are creating added value – in other words, if we can achieve greater benefit by spending a euro at European level than by spending it at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Europe must continue to uphold budgetary discipline. Budgetary discipline means the own resources ceiling, which is set at 1.24%. The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period. However, the Commission has also clearly stated that the proposal by the six Member States to impose a budget cap at 1% not only conflicts with the objectives but quite simply does not stand up to a reality check. The Commission is proposing an average level of appropriations for commitments of 1.22% for the period 2007 – 2013. If we also include expenditure for the European Development Fund and the sound new instrument of the Solidarity Fund, the appropriations for commitments stand at 1.26%. Commitments for payments will thus average 1.14% of combined economic performance, or GNI, over the period. That means that the budget volume that we are proposing can be set at an average of 1.14% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on the length of the financial perspective, as this is quite rightly a very important issue for this House. The Commission completely agrees that for democratic and institutional reasons, five years would be the right length of time. The question is simply this: at which point in time is it most appropriate to commence this cycle? We have discussed this matter in considerable detail. On the one hand, given that we have set agricultural spending up to 2013, and since the integration of the new Member States into new programmes is no small matter, and especially also in light of the Structural Funds, and taking account of the question when it is best to start the cycle from an institutional perspective, we are proposing a seven-year period again this time round as a transitional phase, as it were, before commencing the five-year cycle thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise, yet again, the following points concerning the comparison of figures: this Commission is serious about the proposal to integrate the European Development Fund into the budget. It has been stated repeatedly in the past that this would be desirable. The measure outlined in our proposal therefore fulfils a demand that this Parliament has quite rightly been voicing for years, for we need an integrated and effective policy for the ACP states, especially for the poorest countries in the world. That is why we have put forward this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On flexibility, which has been mentioned several times here today: yes, we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead. That is why the Commission has said that a revision is always a possible option. However, we are also planning new flexibility instruments between the categories in order to be able to adjust priorities in the short term. We are also proposing a Growth Adjustment Fund – in other words, a reserve which can be activated additionally if a policy needs to be enhanced for quite specific reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also emphasise yet again that the Commission is proposing the full integration of the new Member States into the structural and cohesion policies. As you are aware, we have based our calculations on a European Union of 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this legislative term, which is now drawing to a close, this House, the European Parliament, has argued robustly and with great success in favour of enlargement. At the same time, it has championed the cause of deepening and European integration. In other words, it has always been in favour of more Europe and an efficient Europe. In doing so, you have consistently upheld budgetary discipline and have been successful here as well. At the end of this legislative term, you can stand before Europe’s citizens and say, with your hand on your heart, that you have done the very best you could with the European budget and genuinely created a great deal of value-added in Europe out of just 2.3% of total public spending. These comments are directed to the Council Presidency in particular. You are now working – and I hope this work will be successful – to ensure the adoption of the new constitution. A key issue here is to equip the European Parliament with more budgetary rights, especially codecision rights in respect of the financial perspective. In my view, the financial perspective must have the endorsement of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to address Mr Colom i Naval. I am at a loss to know how the deliberations on the financial perspective can take place without your powerful commitment and your powerful voice. I wish you every success in your new position. Your region is very fortunate in having secured your services in this key post.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close by citing an Irish writer, because we have the Irish Presidency at the moment and also, of course, as a tribute to the President of this Parliament. Oscar Wilde once said that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. I think that in the coming months, we will have very intensive arguments over spending. However, the key issue is not only expenditure, but also Community policy and the values of the European Union, and I am sure that this House will play a very active and committed role in this debate.</p>

In this respect, today’s debate is an opportunity for the Commission, as is often the case, to try to win the support of the European Parliament for a relatively high level of annual resources, of 1.24% of gross national income (and that is without the European Development Fund), against the position of the contributing Member States, including France, which would like 1% (as in 2004).</p>
<p class="contents">This alliance between Parliament and the Commission is an implicit reference to the idea of a gradual expansion of the Union’s remit, which is intended to lead one day to a federal budget. I might add that in parallel the Commission is launching a campaign for a European tax.</p>
<p class="contents">We must avoid any drift in this direction, so as not to sustain a new bureaucracy and not to compromise the competitiveness objectives that were set in Lisbon. The European Union, which is at the service of the Member States, should not be cornering their tasks, in particular that of redistribution. It should simply provide the added value that comes from coordination, which only requires slim administrations and limited resources. It should live from the contributions that the nation states vote for and control on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the position currently held by the paying Member States seems to us to be entirely justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are seeing is, unfortunately, a repeat of Agenda 2000, when what we really needed was to increase funds, bearing in mind the growing needs in terms of social and economic cohesion resulting from enlargement, and to promote sustainable development, high quality jobs, improved social conditions and cooperation and development policies with the least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening shows the disgraceful nature of the ‘Group of Six’s’ blackmail in placing a ceiling in the Community budget of 1% of GNP, which would lead to what we feel is an unacceptable solution. This has also been shown with the Commission’s unacceptable proposal, which does not meet the needs of the acceding countries, growing social inequality, appalling unemployment or the poverty and exclusion that can be seen in current EU countries, such as Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the question is not exclusively about finance. Of equal importance are the priorities and revision of the objectives and of the instruments of cohesion and budget structure to which they correspond. The guiding principle of competitiveness, strategic realignment based on the Lisbon Agenda, the realignment of foreign policy towards actions within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Spatial Development Perspective, and of internal policy based on questions of immigration policing and border controls, encompass areas that lead European integration down a dangerous path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
