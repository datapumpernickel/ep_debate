<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council has been consistent in promoting cultural and linguistic diversity as well as intercultural dialogue in its policy making together with the Commission and the European Parliament. This policy is enshrined on:</p>
<p>the Treaty on the European Union which, in its Article 3(3), fourth subparagraph, sets out that the EU ‘shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity’.</p>
<p>the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which, in its Article 167, sets out that the EU ‘shall contribute to the flowering of cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity...’. Furthermore, the EU also ‘shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaties, in particular, in order to respect and to promote diversity of its cultures’.</p>
<p>the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which, in its Article 22, sets out that the EU ‘shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity’.</p>
<p>the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions which has been ratified by the European Union. In one of the guiding principles of the Convention, it is stated that ‘the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions presuppose (…) respect for all cultures, including the cultures of persons belonging to minorities (…)’.</p>
<p>In its 2007 Resolution on a European Agenda for Culture<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council endorsed three strategic objectives, one of them being promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue.</p>
<p>This objective has been translated into a priority area in the Council’s work plans for culture since 2002. In the latest Work Plan agreed for 2011-2014<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue will, for the first time, be dealt with by a working group of the Member States experts.</p>
<p>The Council designated the year 2008 as the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. In the decision on designation<a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Council stressed that intercultural dialogue is an important dimension in many Union policies and instruments in the fields such as youth, sport, citizenship, employment and social affairs, combating racism and xenophobia, combating discrimination and social exclusion, audiovisual policy and policy on asylum and the integration of immigrants.</p>
<p>The Council also has noted that the intercultural dialogue can help to bring individuals and peoples closer together, and help towards conflict prevention and the process of reconciliation, especially in regions which are facing politically precarious situations<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The efforts to achieve the targets for energy from renewable sources, which is a long-term challenge, are being made within the framework defined by the Directive on the promotion of energy from renewable sources<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. All Member States had time until last December to implement this directive. It sets binding targets for the share of renewable energy in energy consumption to be reached in 2020, allowing the EU jointly to achieve a 20% share of renewable, as reconfirmed in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>These targets were carefully negotiated in order to get the most out of each Member State’s potential and they represent a high level of ambition. Indeed, the level of ambition reflected in national targets is such that for certain Member States, it will not be possible to reach their targets without making full use of cooperation mechanisms, between Member States as well as with third countries, established by the directive. At the same time, the targets appear realistic, not only because of the cooperation mechanisms already mentioned, but also because of the possibility for Member States to continue with their national schemes to support renewable energy.</p>
<p>The directive is not the only EU instrument that could and will contribute to steer Europe on the path towards increasing the share of renewable energy. Some initiatives to support the generation of energy from renewable sources are already in place, such as the large contribution of the European Energy Programme for Recovery<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to offshore wind energy. Key developments for the transport of renewable energy and the adaptation of networks through the roll-out of smart grids and smart metering will also be prioritised in 2011, as part of the EU Energy Strategy 2020<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, enhanced energy efficiency will be further promoted through the adoption of a reviewed Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which is a priority for the Hungarian Presidency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Trio Presidency Programme prioritised the fight against illegal immigration and the Hungarian Presidency intends to build on the work of the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies in this field in keeping with the objectives set out in the Stockholm Programme<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, whereby effective action against illegal immigration is identified as essential in the context of developing a common immigration policy. The Stockholm Programme equally identifies an effective and sustainable return policy as an essential element of a well-managed migration system within the Union.</p>
<p>Concerning readmission agreements, the Hungarian Presidency will closely monitor the progress in the ongoing negotiations, notably with Turkey, Morocco and Cape Verde, as well as arranging for the launching of negotiations with Belarus. To that aim, and with a view to defining a renewed and coherent strategy on readmission, the Presidency will focus on the Commission’s forthcoming evaluation of readmission agreements.</p>
<p>Fostering practical cooperation among Member States will also be a key point in the Hungarian Presidency’s programme in the field of illegal immigration, with special focus on the effective implementation of the Return Directive. In this regard, the work begun under the Belgian Presidency with regard to the issue of facilitating transit by land of third-country nationals who return voluntarily will be taken forward, thus providing humane solutions for the irregular migrants returning voluntarily to their home countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the question of illegally staying third-country nationals falling under the principle of ‘non-refoulement’ is also on the Presidency’s agenda.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hungarian Presidency will pay attention to the EU-wide collection of statistical data on illegal migration. It is essential to have a full picture on all the data collected in this field, and make them available to the Member States, EU institutions and agencies</p>
<p>Finally, work on all aspects of the Global Approach to Migration<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> will be continued. Europe needs a global approach to migration policy, which should benefit society in the home as well as in the host country, and, of course, the migrants themselves. The Presidency believes that the global approach needs to be balanced thematically (including legal immigration, fight against irregular immigration and the promotion of migration and development) and geographically as well. The Hungarian Presidency attaches great importance to the further development of the Prague Process – Building Migration Partnerships<a href="#defann_3_3" name="refann_3_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> – directed to neighbouring eastern and south-eastern countries, by elaborating – jointly with the members of the Process – an Action Plan for the implementation of the Prague Declaration of April 2009 that would define the concrete objectives and activities required for the realisation of the goals set in the Declaration; including on preventing and fighting irregular immigration. The Hungarian Presidency will also focus on the preparations of the 2nd Ministerial Conference in November 2011. The aim of the ministerial conference will be to endorse the Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The catastrophic earthquake which struck Haiti in January 2010 cost thousands of lives and left an unbearable economic and social situation in the country, which was one of the poorest in the world even before the earthquake. Humanitarian organisations report that, several months after the earthquake, bodies had not been pulled out of the ruins, the sanitary conditions of the population were appalling and humanitarian aid conspicuous by its absence. A cholera epidemic was the logical outcome. The thousands of confirmed victims are adding to the ever-lengthening list of those killed in the earthquake. According to UN (OCHA) information, there is, as usual, a great discrepancy between the aid ‘promised’ and the aid actually delivered.</p>
<p>How much has the EU promised to send to Haiti and how much has it actually delivered to date?

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member is aware, the EU has been at the forefront in responding to both the consequences of the earthquake of 12 January 2010 and the outbreak of the cholera epidemic at the end of October. In coordination with international partners, the EU and its Member States took immediate steps to help the victims by rapidly providing humanitarian emergency assistance and deploying humanitarian and civil protection experts.</p>
<p>At the International Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of Haiti, held in New York on 31 March 2010, the EU presented a joint pledge of EUR 1.235 billion out of a total amount of USD 5.3 billion pledged by all international donors for the period of 18 months, which has made the EU Haiti’s main donor. After the conference, an additional amount of EUR 62 million out of the EU budget was added, which makes in total EUR 522 million earmarked from the EU budget. So far, the Commission has committed EUR 322 million, out of which EUR 115.4 million have already been contracted, and EUR 62 million disbursed. In addition, the Commission has disbursed a total amount of EUR 57.8 million through general budget support since the earthquake, allowing the Haitian Government to maintain critical expenditure, notably in education, health and security<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Moreover, in support of the long-term reconstruction plan for Haiti and in the context of a joint EU approach linking relief to rehabilitation and development, the EU and Member States are currently in the final stage of identifying common priorities, together with the Haitian Government, with a view to adopting a joint programming document at the beginning of 2011.</p>
<p>In response to the cholera epidemic, the Commission has mobilised EUR 12 million to support DG ECHO partners on the ground, in addition to generous in-cash and in-kind contributions from the Member States. Due to the deteriorating situation in Haiti, the Commission has proposed to the budgetary authorities to scale up its humanitarian assistance with an additional EUR 10 million by transferring appropriations within the humanitarian aid part of the EU budget for 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In particular, agriculture is included in the scope of the directive, as is stated in Article 2(1). According to the directive, the employer shall have a duty to ensure the safety and health of the workers in every aspect related to the work (Article 5(1)), including prevention of occupational risks and provision of information and training, as well as provision of the necessary organisation and means (Article 6(1)). The principle of the responsibility of the employer is not affected by the fact that each worker also has a responsibility to take care, as far as possible, of his own safety and health and that of other persons (Articles 4(3) and 13(1)).</p>

At the same time, the Council called on the Commission to continue to monitor and support the implementation of legislation in all Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) Supporting the economy is one of the cornerstones of the Presidency’s work programme for the coming six months, a period which marks the very first ‘European semester’ for economic policy coordination. In this sense, a comprehensive and coherent approach will be taken to the budgetary, macro-economic and growth- and employment-oriented policies of both Member States and the EU itself, in order to ensure both that financial stability is safeguarded and that all economic policies are conducive to strong and sustainable employment-creating growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, key objectives and initiatives were presented by the Council to the December European Council on implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These should be reflected in the national reform programmes and may include the five EU headline targets relating to employment, research and development, energy/climate change, education and combating poverty and social exclusion, as well as the way in which the Member States should set and pursue their national targets, including the need to accelerate reforms addressing identified bottlenecks to growth. Member States will submit their national reform programmes in support of the objectives and targets established in the Europe 2020 strategy by April 2011, alongside frontload key growth enhancing structural reforms.</p>
<p>The Single Market, as a driver of growth, is of crucial importance for Europe’s competitiveness in the globalised economy. The Presidency attaches great importance to achieve an agreement on the Single Market package<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Particular attention will be paid to enhancing the labour market integration of young people in the framework of the two flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely ‘Youth on the Move’ and ‘Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’, which aim to improve the employment of young workers and to make easier the transition from education to employment. The work of the Hungarian Presidency in this area will be closely linked to the joint Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Programme<a href="#defann_10_3" name="refann_10_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> since youth employment is a topic of common interest for the Trio.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the basis of the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs<a href="#defann_10_4" name="refann_10_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Hungarian Presidency intends to address the possibilities for stronger policies to facilitate an employment friendly recovery and address the issue of regional employment inequalities.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Presidency will invite Ministers to engage in a joint reflection on these issues during the informal meeting of Employment Ministers which will take place on 16-18 January 2011 in Gödöllő.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Belarus still has a considerable way to go in meeting its OSCE commitments on holding elections. The EU recognises the serious problems with the electoral process and the vote count as reported by the OSCE election observation mission and urged the government of Belarus to meet its OSCE commitments to substantially reform the electoral process. The EU regrets the government of Belarus’ decision to terminate the mission of the OSCE’s office in Minsk.</p>
<p>The OSCE has carried out valuable work in the country, in particular, in promoting institution building and the rule of law and supporting the development of civil society. The EU sees this process in great danger.</p>
<p>The EU strongly condemns all acts of violence and repression, especially the use of force against presidential candidates, political activists, representatives of civil society, journalists and demonstrators. The beating and detention of several opposition leaders, including presidential candidates, is unacceptable. Taken together, the elections and their aftermath represent a substantial step backwards in the development of democratic governance and respect for human rights in Belarus. The EU called for the immediate release of the presidential candidates and the more than 600 demonstrators who have been imprisoned in the wake of the presidential elections in Belarus.</p>
<p>Respect for democracy and human rights remain central to improving Belarus’s relations with the EU. Without substantial progress in these areas, relations cannot improve. It is against this background that the EU will be assessing the government of Belarus’s actions to address the current situation and to take developments into account as it reviews relations with Belarus. The EU intends to strengthen its support for and engagement with the people of Belarus and civil society representatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000006"></a>

<p>Israel’s army and air force have recently escalated their murderous attacks in the Gaza strip, increasing the number of dead and wounded among the Palestinian civilian population, which is suffering from the occupation and from the economic blockade imposed by Israel which even prevents fishermen from putting to sea. The efforts to terrorise the Palestinian people continued unabated throughout the Christmas and New Year period, mainly around the area of the green line and the wall that Israel has built, and there were also bombing raids inside Gaza.

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council has consistently been calling for a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where Jerusalem would become a capital of two states. As recently as in December 2010, the Foreign Affairs Council reiterated in its conclusions that ‘urgent progress is needed towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We want to see the State of Israel and a sovereign, independent, democratic, contiguous and viable State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security’ and that ‘a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states’.</p>
<p>The issue of Palestinian detainees and prisoners has featured prominently in bilateral contacts between the EU and Israel, for example, within the Informal Working Group on Human Rights, which had its latest meeting in September 2010 and in which the Council actively participates. Specific cases of detention, especially where the detainees could be considered human rights defenders under the EU guidelines, have been dealt with in this working group. Some were also given high visibility by means of statements issued by the office of High Representative, Catherine Ashton. (For example, the statement of the HR spokesperson on Mr Abdullah Abu Rahma of 24 August 2010).</p>
<p>The Israeli policy of blockade against the Gaza Strip has been subject to the Council’s criticism, which described it as ‘unacceptable and politically counterproductive’ (Council conclusions of December 2009, referred to in the December 2010 conclusions). While partial steps by the Israeli Government towards alleviating the policy of closure (most recently on 8 December 2010) are steps in the right direction, more remains to be done.</p>
<p>As regards alleged Israeli actions against civilians, the honourable Member knows that persecution of civilian population by state power, whether directed against a state’s own citizens or otherwise, is contrary to the rule of law and democratic principles in general. By extension, such acts are irreconcilable with basic values of the European Union, notably right to life in safety in security. It is imperative that allegations of such acts be subjected to thorough investigation and, if confirmed, to strong criticism.</p>
<p>Various incidents between Israeli security services and Palestinians as well as in regard to Israeli policies under the occupation regime, the Council has always insisted on respecting international law and including international humanitarian law by both sides. These are principles that the Foreign Affairs Council referred to in its conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process in December 2009 and reiterated as recently as December 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000008"></a>

<p>Last year, Hungary, which has recently taken over the Presidency of the Council, was hit by a major environmental disaster, the red sludge flood. One of the main causes of the disaster was said to be poor maintenance of the facility concerned. The EU does not provide financial assistance to Member States in the event of disasters caused by deliberate human agency or by negligence. If those responsible are short of funds, Member States themselves are often unable to bear the financial consequences of such an accident unassisted.</p>
<p>Does not the Presidency consider that the legal provisions on the planning (particularly in connection with environmental impact assessments), maintenance and operation of installations which pose serious environmental risks should be reviewed and made more stringent? Would it not be desirable to establish a fund in the European Union financed by means of contributions from those with control over installations which pose serious environmental risks, on which it would subsequently be possible to draw to provide compensation for damage caused by environmental disasters attributable to such facilities (similar to the fund voluntarily established by British Petroleum to pay compensation for the consequences of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) An important body of EU legislation, that should help prevent accidents such as the one which occurred in Hungary, is already in place, in particular, legislation on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and on Management of Waste from Extractive Industries<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As regards natural disasters, industrial accidents fall under the Environmental Liability Directive<a href="#defann_13_3" name="refann_13_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> which implements the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>
<p>The full assessment of the applicability of the existing legislation requires the completion of the analysis of the accident in Kolontàr by the Hungarian authorities and the Commission. Once this process is concluded, it will be possible to evaluate whether any further action regarding EU environmental legislation should be considered. Any conclusions from the Commission in this respect will be examined by the Council without delay.</p>
<p>Concerning the suggestion of the honourable Member to establish a fund to provide compensation for damage caused by deliberate acts or negligence, and financed by operators of installations entailing environmental risks, it has to be noted that it is up to the Commission to consider the possible options in light of the present accident, including the option to enable liable operators to bear the full costs of major accidents.</p>
<p>As far as the Solidarity Fund of the European Union is concerned, the Commission suggested in 2006 to review Council Regulation No 2012/2002<a href="#defann_13_4" name="refann_13_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The Commission strongly supports the roll-out of high speed broadband across Europe and has undertaken a number of actions to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The investment needed for broadband infrastructure will largely come from the private sector. In addition, the Commission encourages Member States to support the roll-out of broadband networks with public and EU funds where the business case for private investment is weak.</p>
<p>Just in 2010, the Commission has assessed and approved the use of almost EUR 1.8 billion of State aid for broadband development in the European Union capable of generating EUR 3-3.5 billion of investment in this sector<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Concerning Ireland, the Commission has so far assessed and approved 3 State aid broadband measures in the country and authorised the use of more than EUR 250 million in this sector<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as well as the joint Project Kelvin<a href="#defann_14_3" name="refann_14_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of Ireland and Northern Ireland, aiming to bring a direct international link through a submarine cable to the North West of Ireland.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission is working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify innovative financing solutions for the next Multiannual Financial Framework that could broaden the investment horizon to include, through credit and maturity enhancement, higher risk profile projects in less populated geographic areas.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Commission will also issue guidance for local and regional authorities on the use of EU funds for broadband project design and preparation and will adopt investment guidelines on broadband for local and regional authorities to facilitate full absorption of EU funds. In addition, by 2013, the Commission will reinforce and rationalise the use of funding of high-speed broadband through EU instruments under the current financial framework (e.g. ERDF, ERDP, EAFRD, TEN, CIP).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) For the last 5 years, the NAIADES Action Programme inspired the Commission’s inland shipping policy and will continue to do so for another 3 years. NAIADES addresses, in the first place, a series of legislative, policy and coordination measures, originating from current policies and the existing regulatory framework, and aiming at enhanced framework conditions for the sector and its consolidation. We can already see an increase in the share of inland waterway in the overall transport.</p>
<p>It is obvious that such a programme cannot be pursued at EU level alone, but requires also the commitment of Member States and the inland navigation sector as well as an appropriate implementation at national level.</p>
<p>NAIADES was meant as a medium to long-term policy programme that aims at making better use of relevant funding programmes such as TEN-T and Marco Polo. However, NAIADES is not a financial support programme with its own financial resources.</p>
<p>The second progress report on NAIADES summarising the main achievements in the five priority areas up to now will be published in the first half of 2011. As regards the remaining period 2011-2013, the Commission intends to continue with the implementation of NAIADES along already defined lines.</p>
<p>But the Commission also needs to ensure the long-term development and successful implementation of a European inland waterway transport policy beyond 2013. Therefore, it intends to bring forward a proposal for a continuation programme in due time, embedded in the wider strategic policy framework as defined by the forthcoming White Paper and developing further successful activities and reflecting on possible ‘lessons learnt’ where necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0633"></a>

<p>Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 came into force as long ago as 2005, with the key aim of ensuring that airline passengers were protected and properly informed. The Commission has run its own awareness-raising campaigns on the subject, yet airlines repeatedly violate the regulation, leaving passengers without swift and effective remedies. Meanwhile, online booking has turned into a racket: a ticket from Brussels to Strasbourg with an ordinary carrier, advertised and heavily promoted at the price of EUR 98, ends up costing a total of EUR 219.60, including something called a ‘fuel fee’!</p>

<p>(EN) First, let the Commission remind that the correct application of Regulation No 261/2004 on air passengers’ rights must be ensured by the designated National Enforcement Bodies. These National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs) have to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are fully respected. The Commission constantly monitors their activity to ensure that EU law is correctly implemented and enforced by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is ready to intervene if there is a pattern of cases which shows that a Member State is failing to enforce the regulation. The Commission has been working in close cooperation with NEBs to improve the application of the regulation, notably through common interpretation, exchange of information on enforcement, exchange of best practices and further harmonisation of working tools as statistics on sanctions and complaints. In 2010, the Commission has encouraged several joint NEB actions against carriers, which greatly contributed to ensuring the successful harmonised correction of any improper practice.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission would like to recall that means of redress are available to passengers. The National authorities are also in charge of handling complaints from passengers and to issue a motivated opinion, albeit not binding, on the circumstances of the passenger’s individual case. Furthermore, air passengers always retain the right to seek redress via a court procedure. In this context, they may benefit from the European procedure of settlement of small disputes: a simplified, accelerated and cheaper court procedure for small cross-border disputes. They should also be able to benefit from the work of the Commission in the area of collective redress. Further initiatives of the Commission in the field of consumer protection will also help passengers. For instance, the future legislative proposal on ADR – Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms under the responsibility of the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Policy, foreseen in the Commission Work Programme for the end of 2011, will improve the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms as an easy, low cost and quick way of resolving disputes out of court.</p>
<p>Finally, the honourable Member raises the issue of the price indications given during the booking process. Regulation No 1008/2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community provides for price transparency rules: the final price to be paid shall, at all times, be indicated, including in advertisements; it shall include the applicable air fare as well as applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication. This also includes the so-called fuel surcharge that you mention. The Commission is monitoring this important question very closely, in close cooperation with the national authorities in charge of enforcement in the Members States. In 2011, the Commission will undertake a deeper review on the matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0643"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-supported study to conduct variant-independent research into upgrading works on the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is of particular importance in the effort to identify a generally acceptable way out of this long deadlock. A deadlock that prevents inland waterways transport – in this part of the transcontinental connection – from fulfilling its potential as a particularly sustainable mode of transport, in both environmental and economic terms.</p>
<p>Developing inland waterways transport in a sound and sustainable manner helps lower the pressure on road transport – emissions, noise, congestion – and, in this specific case, also contributes to a better linking of regions, economies and people along one of the main natural connections of our continent (East-West, North-South).</p>
<p>It should be stressed in passing that economic development without proper care for environmental realities also poses undue economic risks, whilst fundamental blindness to sustainable and balanced solutions may entail serious environmental risks, such as from modal backshift, among other things.</p>
<p>On the Bavarian stretch of the Danube, between these two cities, the depth of the river is not sufficient for a reliable and economically viable navigation throughout the year. For two decades, inland waterway operators and environmental organisations have been debating on how to improve the navigability of the Danube.</p>
<p>Environmental organisations would favour the so-called ‘Variant A’ in order to preserve the last free-flowing section of the middle section of the Danube River, through the consolidation of the river banks for flood protection.</p>
<p>Transport operators object that this is the only section, from the Dutch border on the Rhine to the Austrian border on the Danube, where inland waterways transport cannot be ensured throughout the year as required. Transport operators therefore supported the so-called Variant C-280 that would ensure a draught of 2.80 metres throughout the year, but requiring the construction of a lock.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this stalemate, the German Government launched, together with the Land of Bavaria, a three-year study to explore possible alternative solutions to these two opposing Variants. At the suggestion of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) Coordinator, Mrs K Peijs, a Monitoring Group to accompany the study was set up in January 2010 with the agreement of both parties: it is composed of nine prominent persons, four from the environmental side and four from the operator’s side, chaired by an independent Professor, Hans-Joachim Koch, from the University of Hamburg.</p>
<p>The Group has met several times since its formation in March 2010 and work progresses. It is expected that the study will produce valuable and fully transparent results in 2012, supporting the regional and national authorities in developing economically and environmentally sustainable inland waterways transport on the Danube.</p>
<p>Recent newspaper articles in the Bavarian/German press alleged that the implication of the Rhein-Main-Donau (RMD) company was impairing the transparency and the neutrality of the study. The Commission has been informed by the Monitoring Group Chairman that he has no reason to believe that the study is not performed correctly.</p>
<p>The subject of the study is to find an acceptable solution independent from the previous assessment and, by its very nature, will have to be in the interests of all parties concerned, including RMD.</p>
<p>The Commission is also aware of statements made by the German Transport Minister, Mr Ramsauer, as have other concerned parties in the matter. In the Commission’s view, such statements do not impair the proper results of the study but contribute to useful transparency in the discussion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0645"></a>

Consequently, we should be able to minimise the potential disruption in case of future events of this kind.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue the work on all actions proposed in its information note of 27 April 2010 and endorsed by the extraordinary Transport Council of 4 May 2010, as well as other activities where European contribution is deemed necessary, notably the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s International Volcanic Ash Task Force.</p>
<p>In particular, we need to build greater resilience into our transport system to preserve the mobility of passengers and goods in case of disruptive events.

<p>(EN) Today, there is no EU legislation on the regular use of security scanners at EU airports. Member States can only use security scanners as a trial for a limited period of time, as a more stringent measure or as a demonstration. Therefore, the use of scanners does not currently fall under the Commission’s inspection programme.</p>
<p>In the context of the preparation of the impact assessment on the use of security scanners in the autumn of 2010, the Commission has been informed that security scanners based on different technologies are or have been used at the following EU airports: Amsterdam Schiphol, London Heathrow, Manchester, Helsinki, Hamburg and Paris Charles de Gaulle. On the basis of this information, X-ray security scanners are currently in use in London Heathrow and Manchester. The Commission is also aware that demonstrations of security scanners took place in Rome Fiumicino, Venice, Milan Malpensa, Palermo and Copenhagen airports, However, the Commission has not received any official confirmation from the appropriate Italian and Danish authorities.</p>
<p>To date, the Commission does not have an up-to-date overview of precise national rules that apply to maintenance controls to protect passengers from health risks at security screening check points. However, conditions for health protection enshrined in EU and EURATOM legislation apply.</p>
<p>In particular, as regards the use of X-ray equipment, security scanners like any other equipment using ionising radiation, need to respect the legal provisions set for their use. Indeed, the risk of long-term health effects from exposure to ionising radiation, albeit very small at low doses, is well known. For this reason, all equipment shall respect the provisions of Directive 96/29/Euratom<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, including the application of the following main principles, namely:</p>
<p>justification of the equipment’s use before being first put in operation regarding its economic, social or other benefits in relation to the health detriment it may cause;</p>
<p>optimisation of protection to ensure that the radiation doses from the practice are kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account;</p>
<p>limitation of the exposure to ensure that the sum of the doses from all relevant practices will not exceed the legal dose limits for workers or the general public.</p>
<p>Ensuring compliance with the above provisions falls under the responsibility of the national authorities.</p>

<p>(EN) Air travel and, to a lesser extent, land transport in December 2010 was heavily disrupted throughout Europe. Many of our larger hubs partially closed during one of the busiest weekends of the year: the beginning of the Christmas holidays. Overall, thousands of flights were cancelled and tens of thousands of people were stranded at airports, not to speak about major luggage handling problems. It is the Commission’s duty to minimise the impact of these extreme weather conditions if these were to happen again. The Commission is, however, very pleased that no accident occurred and that safety was ensured.</p>
<p>Concerning the improvement of the overall transport network in case of crisis, the Commission also plans to use the existing work that has been carried out in the aftermath of the ash cloud crisis of April 2010: the Commission has been reflecting upon ways to ensure operators or Member States have mobility plans for passengers and goods to be applied in case of a sudden transport crisis. In this context, the Commission submitted a list of questions to Member States during the last Transport Council of 2 December 2010.</p>
<p>First, we have to learn from what happened. As Commissioner Kallas, responsible for Transport, announced in December 2010, he will meet on 19 January 2011with airport representatives to discuss precisely what happened and what could be done to avoid similar situations in the future. The Commission is, of course, open to discuss any solutions that would avoid a repetition of the events in December 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission’s services will also work together with Member States’ authorities and take this opportunity to welcome those Member States that offered to share their findings with the Commission and that supported action at EU level if necessary.</p>
<p>Based on these discussions, the Commissioner in charge of Transport will see if there is a need for the Commission to propose new measures. If so, he will not hesitate to take action. The Airport package that he will present later in 2011 will be very important.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to build on other planned initiatives. The upcoming revision of the Air Passenger Rights Regulation could be an opportunity to improve the communication with passengers as well as the re-routing of stranded passengers, for instance, by temporarily suspending night curfew restrictions.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to work hard to improve the European air travel system to ensure that European citizens will not have to go through a similar experience again.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0627"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands the concerns of the honourable Members. Similar preoccupations have been expressed by other Members of Parliament, Member States and European industry.</p>
<p>The EU advocates an ambitious approach to the opening up of the global procurement markets. For this reason, the EU is a party to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), which opens up the public procurements markets of the world’s most developed nations. In addition, the EU has concluded free trade agreements with a procurement chapter with a number of trading partners (including, for example, Chile, Mexico, Korea and Switzerland), which open the procurement markets of these partners on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>However, the EU has no international commitments vis-à-vis China in the area of public procurement. As a consequence, China and its suppliers do not have the right to be treated equally to the EU’s GPA partners.</p>
<p>Since China is currently negotiating accession to the GPA, this situation could change in the coming years. In the context of the accession process, the EU requests China to commit to setting ambitious market access goals. In parallel with these negotiations, the Commission is conducting an intensive dialogue with China aiming at the improvement of the Chinese regulatory procurement framework to render it GPA compliant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has announced in its Communications ‘Towards a Single Market Act’<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and ‘Trade, Growth and World Affairs’<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that it will present in 2011 a legislative proposal clarifying the international market access commitments of the EU in the field of public procurement. The objective of this proposal will be to restore equal competition on the internal market and ensure an increased leverage of the EU in international negotiations. It will also clarify the position of third countries (and their suppliers) which have not subscribed to any international commitments vis-à-vis the EU in this field and will be based on reciprocity.

<p>(EN) Coastal erosion seriously affects around 25% of the European coasts<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The problem is likely to increase due to climate change impacts, such as sea level rise and more frequent and intense storm surges. Moreover, increasing coastal development may interfere with natural sediment processes or augment the assets and population at risk of coastal erosion or flooding. The pan-European study EUROSION<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> established the extent of the coastal erosion problem in Europe and provided guidance, case studies and policy concepts to address coastal erosion more effectively. In 2010, the CONSCIENCE<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> project elaborated the policy concepts further and recommended ways to implement them. Furthermore, projects and studies confirm that the financial costs of coastal defence and adaptation measures are significant. Prevention and early adaptation to climate risk are shown to be cost-effective policy options<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The Commission’s 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> addresses coastal risks, including coastal erosion and proposes action to increase the resilience of coastal and marine areas. Work is now underway to ensure that adaptation in coastal areas is included in the framework of the Integrated Maritime Policy.</p>
<p>The research confirms that a comprehensive and integrated approach is needed to address coastal erosion risk adequately. The basis for such an integrated approach is provided by the 2002 Parliament and Council Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. Also, other existing EU instruments, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directives<a href="#defann_25_7" name="refann_25_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> and the Floods Directive<a href="#defann_25_8" name="refann_25_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> are important to reduce coastal erosion risk. For the Mediterranean coastal zones, the EU ratified the ICZM Protocol to the Barcelona Convention<a href="#defann_25_9" name="refann_25_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> in September 2010. The Protocol includes specific stipulations on coastal erosion.</p>
<p>The Commission will take the problem of coastal risk into account in the impact assessment for a follow-up to the ICZM Recommendation, envisaged for the end of 2011. Given that spatial planning is identified as an important tool to reduce vulnerability in coastal areas, the impact assessment considers both coastal management and maritime spatial planning (MSP)<a href="#defann_25_10" name="refann_25_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>. In the meantime, the Commission continues to support the exchange of experience and best practice in the implementation of ICZM through the OURCOAST initiative<a href="#defann_25_11" name="refann_25_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>. The initiative will deliver an interactive database with at least 350 cases and guidance on specific topics and ICZM principles, including adaptation to risks and climate change.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is carrying out a number of measures in order to fully implement an EU framework for the prevention of disasters, as proposed by the Communication on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters adopted in February 2009<a href="#defann_25_12" name="refann_25_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and enhanced by the Council<a href="#defann_25_13" name="refann_25_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a>. Within this framework, the Commission issued, on 21 December 2010<a href="#defann_25_14" name="refann_25_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a>, a guidance paper on national risk assessment and mapping for disaster management, which was developed together with the national authorities of the Member States. The ‘Risk Assessment and Mapping Guidelines for Disaster Management’ aim to enhance coherence and comparability between risks assessments developed at national level in the Member States. The non-binding guidelines, based on a multi-hazard and multi-risk approach, give orientation on matters of terminology, the involvement of different sectors and stakeholders, and the most useful methods and concepts.</p>
<p>Further to the White Paper on Adaptation to climate change, the Commission is also developing an Adaptation Clearinghouse, to be operational by early 2012, that will cover key policy sectors, including coastal areas. The aim of the clearinghouse is to enhance the uptake of knowledge by national, regional or local decision makers, by offering guidance, tools and best practices for assessments of vulnerability to climate change at different geographical levels. Building on the implementation of the White Paper, the Commission will, by 2013, develop a comprehensive EU Adaptation Strategy.</p>
<p>Regarding funding opportunities, the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy will invest about EUR 5.8 billion in natural risk prevention. In accordance with the principle of ‘shared management’, it is up to the Member States to select and implement the co-funded projects based on the priorities set in the relevant Operational Programmes. In this framework, coastal protection activities might be supported. As regards Portugal, EUR 513 684 600 are planned to be invested in ‘risk prevention’ through its Operational Programmes of the 2007-13 Cohesion Policy. The Atlantic transnational programme supports ANCORIM (Atlantic network for coastal risk management)<a href="#defann_25_15" name="refann_25_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a>, which includes Portuguese partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very much aware of the difficult situation Member States are confronted with in tackling irregular migration.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned especially by the situation in Greece at its land border with Turkey where currently, 90% of detected irregular crossings of migrants along the EU’s external borders take place.</p>
<p>It should be underlined that the responsibility for controlling the external borders in accordance with the requirements set out by European law, notably, the Schengen Border Code, lies entirely with the Member States. Greece, like any other Member State, therefore has to do its utmost in order to meet those requirements.</p>
<p>However, the European Union should demonstrate solidarity and assist the Member States in its efforts to bring irregular migration under control.</p>
<p>With this objective, the EU is promoting a number of initiatives such as the joint operations and supporting concrete projects through the allocation of financial resources under the relevant Funds (External Borders Fund, European Refugee Fund and Return Fund).</p>
<p>Greece has been the main ‘beneficiary’ of FRONTEX operational activities in 2010, hosting joint operations at its land and maritime borders in order to increase the efficiency of border management (including surveillance, checks and identification of irregular immigrants with a view to their return with due respect for any potential need for protection). Due to the exceptional pressure of irregular immigration at its external borders, Greece requested on 24 October 2010 the assistance of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) and a decision to deploy these teams was taken shortly after. The deployment of RABITs has already had a deterrent effect and it is estimated that there has been an overall decrease of 43% in the number of irregular migrants intercepted at the Greek-Turkish land border.</p>
<p>In tackling irregular migration, it is of vital importance to work with countries of origin and transit. Therefore, the Commission encourages Member States and FRONTEX to develop practical cooperation with those countries.</p>
<p>Concretely, this could involve initiatives such as the exchange of information on the modus operandi of irregular migrants and facilitators, the development of common risk analyses with regard to movements of irregular migrants, the appointment of contact points in FRONTEX and in the third countries’ authorities for the purpose of a continuous, operational exchange of information and cooperation with regard to returning irregular immigrants.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is also actively developing direct dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of origin and transit of migration, in order to persuade them to increase their efforts to prevent and combat irregular migration and to readmit the irregular migrants having transited through their territory.</p>
<p>With reference to the countries mentioned by the honourable Member, in particular, the Commission is taking concrete initiatives with all of them. The Commission is negotiating a readmission agreement with Morocco, is making serious efforts to start negotiations on a readmission agreement with Algeria, has proposed that Tunisia accepts the inclusion of provisions related to cooperation on the readmission of irregular migrants into the new EU-Tunisia Action Plan, and the readmission agreement with Pakistan, which the Commission successfully negotiated with this country on behalf of the European Union, entered into force on 1 December 2010.</p>
<p>Within this context, particular attention is paid to Turkey, a country through which a large amount of irregular migrants and asylum seekers transit towards the European Union coming from origin countries in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>As a candidate for accession to the European Union, Turkey is expected to make particular efforts to enhance its policies and legislation in the areas of border, migration and asylum management, as well as the administrative capacities of its relevant authorities, in line with the European Union standards. The Commission closely monitors the progress made by Turkey in developing its capacities, and is providing important financial and technical assistance in this endeavour. Meanwhile, the Commission continues to negotiate a readmission agreement with Turkey on behalf of the European Union, while FRONTEX is negotiating a working arrangement with Turkish authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0642"></a>

The Communication already indicates that among the objectives of the centre will be to ‘build operational and analytical capacity for investigations and cooperation with international partners. The centre will improve evaluation and monitoring of existing preventive and investigative measures, support the development of training and awareness-raising for law enforcement and judiciary, establish cooperation with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and interface with a network of national/governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). The cybercrime centre should become the focal point in Europe’s fight against cybercrime’<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>After a protracted procedure, all the EU institutions finally came to an agreement on the EU budget for 2011. The EP had to back down from its initial request for a budget increase of more than 6% compared to 2010. The final compromise proposal keeps the budget increase at 2.91%, a total of €126.5 billion, despite the fact that new structures, such as the European External Action Service, will have to be financed from this small increase.</p>
<p>Can the Commission elaborate how these appropriations for 2011 will affect payments for Lithuanian farmers, as well as those from other EU Member States? Could the Commission provide exact figures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for asking this question, which enables it to highlight the fact that the budget adopted in December 2010 by Parliament and the Council will not affect payments for farmers in Lithuania, or for those in any other Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p>In reality, the approved budget integrated the amending letter adopted by the Commission on 20 October 2010. In that amending letter, the Commission included the latest estimates for agricultural expenditure – markets and direct payments.</p>
<p>The budget has been drafted for the EU-27 as a whole and not per Member State. Nonetheless, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that, for Lithuania, the budget line for the SAPS includes a sum of EUR 262 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
