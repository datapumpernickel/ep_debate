<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, as you indicated, this is an extremely serious issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, since we discussed the situation in Syria last October, the brutal repression has continued. The situation is dramatic and particularly worrying in Homs. As honourable Members will have seen, the UN reports the number of victims has reached 5 000 people – and this may well be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is totally unacceptable. The brutal repression of civilians has to stop. Assad must listen to his people, his neighbours, to the Arab partners, to Europe and to the world. We all have the same message: he should stop the violence to his own people. He should let that transition get under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands remain in detention. The recent report of the UN International Commission of Inquiry indicates that crimes against humanity were committed by the security forces. Some people in Syria are taking up arms to defend themselves and the risk of widespread armed confrontation is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this complex and difficult background, we have ratcheted up our sanctions and we have done whatever we can to build a growing international consensus to isolate the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been in regular contact with the Arab League Secretary-General, al-Araby and hosted him at the latest Foreign Affairs Council. The Arab League has our full support in their demands on the Syrian regime, including the immediate cessation of violence, withdrawal of military from cities, and the granting of humanitarian and media access.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also backed their plan to dispatch an observer mission to protect civilians, offering our assistance, and have welcomed their decision to impose sanctions. Regional leadership is key and should continue. The role of Turkey, with which I have been in regular contact, and its decision to impose sanctions is also crucial as we seek to weaken the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked hard on the international scene, stepping up contacts with key international partners to isolate further the regime and its supporters. I have discussed this with Secretary Clinton in Washington, with Prime Minister Lavrov in Moscow, with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and with Foreign Minister Davutoglu when I met him in Bonn while he was visiting there.</p>
<p class="contents">In the UN, successful efforts by the EU and Member States led to a resolution in the Third Committee of the General Assembly. A Special Session of the Geneva Human Rights Council was called at my initiative and a new resolution was adopted with unprecedented support in early December, establishing a Special Rapporteur for human rights in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Now all members of the UN Security Council must assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in Syria. The EU and its Member States will continue to lead the efforts for a strong and united message.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian opposition has grown more active and is better organised, certainly over the last few months. Like honourable Members, I have met this morning with a Syrian Human Rights activist and I know the role that this Parliament has played in engaging with those activists and encouraging them and their work. I have met with other leaders of the Syrian National Council and welcomed the ongoing efforts by the Syrian opposition to try and establish a united platform and to work for a shared vision for the future of Syria and the transition to a democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on the importance of a strong and inclusive opposition political platform taking in all religious and ethnic communities. It is essential that the Syrian opposition maintains and develops its clear commitment to a peaceful and non-sectarian approach. The coordination with opposition on the ground to set out plans for the transition is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the sanctions track, our strong response to the Syrian regime’s policy of repression has been further reinforced. Further individuals and entities linked to the regime have been added to the assets freeze and travel ban: now, 86 individuals and 30 entities are on the list. At the beginning of this month, new measures were adopted to strengthen and complement the existing sanctions. In the oil sector, we have added a ban on the export of key technologies and equipment. In the financial sector, we have expanded the prohibitions on contacts with Syrian banks and we have also established a ban on the export of monitoring software and equipment in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<p class="contents">But despite the efforts of everyone, the Syrian regime has remained defiant. None of the opportunities offered by the Arab League have yet been accepted. We think that they need to comply fully with the Arab Plan of Action. But they want to find excuses and dilute the effectiveness of an observer mission but the Arab League, I am pleased to say, remains strong in their position.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a word on the humanitarian situation. I believe it is increasingly worrying. Conditions are worsening in the places most badly hit by the violent repression and armed confrontation. These include electricity cuts, water supplies, shortage of basic commodities in the areas most affected such as Baba Amr, a quarter in Homs.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently, a systematic denial of access has made it impossible to independently assess the situation. We are particularly concerned about the consistent reports of abuse related to the harassment of medical personnel and difficulties for wounded victims to safely access emergency health care.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to assume that the information provided is correct, in the absence of free and unimpeded access for aid agencies to independently assess and respond to the most urgent needs.</p>
<p class="contents">DG ECHO (European Community Humanitarian Office) is closely monitoring the situation from Damascus and was able to carry out a field mission in October. The ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) continues to negotiate access to detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made it clear that we are ready to provide emergency assistance should humanitarian needs be confirmed. We are also recognising the vulnerability of Syrian refugees hosted by neighbouring countries, particularly Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and we are ready to support these refugees if the host countries request our help. We have made that knowledge available to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Syrian authorities to allow this humanitarian access without restriction and across the country, so that Syrians who are in need can receive immediate assistance. I hope that we will see action in the Security Council and that all members will take their responsibilities, respond to this and respond to what the UN Commissioner for Human Rights has said, with a great sense of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You and we have done a great deal – imposed sanctions, established contacts with the Arab League, with this and that organisation – yet, given the 5 000 deaths that we have now had in Syria and, above all, such a bleak outlook there, I think we actually need to keep in mind a number of scenarios.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, all the scenarios that I read about are potentially jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire, whether this be slowly repressing the regime which is not going to relinquish power of its own accord, or a violent clash offering arms, for instance, to the Syrian free army, which could lead to greater repression. Whichever scenario we consider, they are all relatively bleak.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect you to come up with a scenario that is a little more constructive and to say: this is what can be done, these are the risks, this is what we intend to do. There is the humanitarian aspect, which you highlighted, but which is not a scenario in itself; it is merely offering a lifeline to those now fighting for their freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you some wonderful stories about this side of things – but I do not have the time here – stories which we have been told by Syrian women about how they are coping, how they are involved in mediation, how they care for the victims, set up hospitals in their homes, establish funds to support the families of victims who are in prison, who have been tortured or who have disappeared. Internal opposition is therefore increasing and it is to them that aid should be delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, firstly, we need to come up with a scenario and, secondly, step up humanitarian aid, but for pity’s sake, we need to take action and at least do something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen this movie before. However, in Hama in 1982, there were no cameras acting as eye witness to the world. Now we know what is happening. Al-Assad has killed and tortured to death 5 000 citizens including children; tens of thousands are imprisoned and, instead of al-Assad meeting the ultimatums of the international community, specifically the Arab League, he has given his own citizens an ultimatum to give up members of the opposition, which remains largely peaceful.</p>
<p class="contents">Al-Assad orders to shoot and kill and has confirmed in his interview last week that he, as Head of Government and commander-in-chief, takes no responsibility at all for what is happening in his country. He has lost his dignity and his legitimacy and I believe that the EU must do everything to prevent the massacre from going on any further. The impunity must end.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act more credibly and forcefully by imposing additional targeted sanctions, specifically on the families supporting this murderous regime and keeping it in power, and by implementing the Council conclusions on Syria of 1 December in which the EU decided to stop the export of technologies used to monitor the Internet, to breach and track people’s communications and information flows and to take them out of their homes based on the signals from their cell phone.</p>
<p class="contents">The information war that is going on is real. And as was the case with oil sanctions, the statement in relation to the digital arms trade – which we have fought to stop for years – has been made. However, we still have to await its implementation, and this is hurting our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of credibility, I think it is disturbing that Cyprus blocked Turkey’s participation in the Foreign Affairs Council on Syria. What will you do to ensure that this does not happen again and that we can work with this vital partner, Turkey, on establishing humanitarian corridors and in collaborating through Turkey with NATO as well? The Syrians need the EU and Turkey to cooperate and I urge you to work on this credibility issue, which is very important.</p>

<p class="contents">It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall.</p>
<p class="contents">What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think ...</p>

Many attended who were not part of the SNC.

Let me add this: the things I am about to say have been very much coloured by daily telephone contacts I have been having with a friend of mine, an Arabist, who is studying for a PhD in Damascus.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just run through them: that is, my questions to you, Baroness Ashton. Are you maintaining direct contact with the Syrian National Council or is that reserved only for some of the more prominent Member States? What is your view of the revelation that, not only is this Syrian National Council dominated by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, but it also adopts a different slant when in dialogue with its foreign contacts (to whom it projects itself as anti-Iran and anti-Hezbollah) than it does domestically (where it projects itself as anti-Israel)?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question: if the Assad regime were to fall, the last and only secular state in the Middle East would disappear. That is stressed by every foreign – that is, not Syrian – analyst in Damascus that I have spoken to. What implications do you think that will have for Syrian religious minorities, which make up between 25 and 40% of the population?</p>
<p class="contents">Syrian domestic and international opposition leaders hold two conflicting views. Dialogue with the Assad regime versus a violent overthrow of the regime: that is, civil war. What do you think about something which a Syrian dissident to whom I spoke today proposed: namely, that we should make European support for the Syrian National Council conditional on their commitment to negotiating with the Assad regime, in order to prevent the country from disintegrating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a certain air of defiance in his claims that he has no fear of sanctions. The measures taken by the EU to date, such as the weapons embargo, the freezing of accounts and the bans on investment and on the import of oil, are certainly hitting the Syrian economy. As economic pressure is increasing, the noose around Assad’s neck is certainly tightening. This is the only way that Europe can exert pressure on the regime. We are largely in agreement with the Arab League on this issue. It is important that not only the West, but also the Arab League and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, should call on Assad to implement serious reforms and to end the bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that resistance is growing among the population. One only has to consider the latest general strikes. However, these will only hurt Assad when the capital, Damascus, and the economic centre, Aleppo, are hit. Both cities seem to be firmly in the grip of the dictator. Even though the Syrian opposition is now touring the world’s major political powers in an effort to drum up support, it must be clear that there can be no question of military intervention on the part of the European Union. If Assad gives in to the economic pressure and a civil war really does break out, we can certainly expect a flood of refugees. The European Union needs to take appropriate precautionary measures now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the embargos nor the sanctions are achieving enough. The Syrian regime is still massacring the populace, and there is no other option than to carry on working to get the army to return to its barracks and to stop people from being massacred. This is why I believe we must continue working on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to reiterate that we must strengthen the democratic opposition. It is true that they are activists, but we should focus on working with the Syrian National Council, regardless of who is in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian National Council is a fairly representative platform, not just outside Syria, but also inside the country. It should be regarded as a valid dialogue partner, being best placed to tell us what is happening there and how the international community and Parliament can support these efforts, because these efforts have ...</p>

Many opposition leaders have welcomed the sanctions as a means to cut off the government’s ability to maintain its massive security apparatus, but many observers have also stressed the damage that some of the sanctions are doing to the Syrian people, with skyrocketing prices for basic foodstuffs and the rapid devaluation of the Syrian pound.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to continue using sanctions. We should intensify our pressure against the selling of arms to the Syrian regime, and we should further penalise those providing military equipment or technological support. However, we should avoid impacting too much on ordinary citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is fundamental to promote the acceptance of an international role in ending the conflict in Syria. I am not talking about the acceptability of a Libya-like scenario for Syria, but of mediation undertaken by a multilateral entity like the UN, the EU, the Arab League or others. I would be glad to know what your ideas on this issue are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago.

<p class="contents">I just want to deal with a few of the issues that were raised. I will begin with what was said by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra at the beginning and to reassure honourable Members of the things that we are trying to do. We have strong economic sanctions, we keep them under constant review and we ratchet them up in order to try to put on as much pressure as possible. We hope that the new sanctions that the Arab League are going to put on will also have a strong effect in order to make the regime realise what they must do. That does include an oil embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">We worked closely with the Arab League. That is why we invited Secretary-General al-Araby to come to the Foreign Affairs Council. We are supporting them in any way we can as they think about how to get monitors to do their deployment on the ground. So we have already made it clear that we will support them in any way that it is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a humanitarian corridor has been dropped. Some ideas come and they are looked at and examined and then it is decided that they are not going to work in the way that we wanted. Therefore, that idea is no longer on the table. It is very important – as a number of honourable Members have said – that we continue to work in the Security Council to try to get a stronger, unanimous view on what needs to happen. Indeed I did raise this when I travelled to China and I raised this with the Foreign Minister of Russia when I was in Moscow very recently. We raised the problem with Syria – the difficulties to the people of Syria – in all of our international meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say to Ms De Keyser, we do meet with the opposition. We have met those who have come forward and asked to meet with us. We do not discriminate about whom we meet. We talk to them all, but we give the same messages about the need to be inclusive and to be supportive of the human rights of everybody who is concerned about what is happening in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made it very clear that al-Assad must go, but I must correct something that Ms Schaake and Ms Flautre both said. It was not Cyprus that blocked Turkey coming to the Foreign Affairs Council. This is totally and utterly untrue. What happened was that we were asked, we discussed the matter and I invited the Secretary-General of the Arab League. He wished to come on an institution-to-institution meeting. The previous week, I had met with the Foreign Minister of Turkey – Foreign Minister Davutoglu – and I proposed at the Foreign Affairs Council, on the day that the Arab League were coming, that at the next meeting, we should invite Foreign Minister Davutoglu. I was supported in that by everyone, including Cyprus. So please, for the record, it really is important that you understand that it was not Cyprus blocking. I did not invite them because in discussion with the Arab League, they wanted to meet institution-to-institution. Therefore, I have invited the Foreign Minister of Turkey, whom I meet and discuss these issues with a great deal. I am looking forward very much to seeing him when he comes in January.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, as everyone has said, to involve all groups. I am glad, Mr Karim, that you appreciate the ‘No disconnect strategy’ that has been announced today by Neelie Kroes. We are working very closely with her on that. That will be important because of the significance of technology, which a number of honourable Members have raised as well. We will continue to meet with all of the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder, we do meet with the Syrian National Council. I have already met with them. It is not just Member States who meet with them, though I encourage Member States to meet with opposition parties and opposition leaders in order to get the breadth of our experience of what is happening and to look for ways in which we can support people more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We are supporting the Arab League, Mr Arlacchi, in its efforts to try to move the situation on and to persuade the regime to understand what it has to do. We are very clear that al-Assad should go. We have made it very clear for some months that, frankly, if you behave in this way, if you kill your people, you have lost the rights for leadership. The important thing is to try to work with all our partners to put the pressure on.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to echo again the importance of getting the UN Security Council to now move on this. We will do everything we can, but we actually need international partners to really push forward with us on this, in order that we can get the maximum effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President al-Assad must immediately cease the use of lethal force against peaceful protestors, stand down from power and allow the citizens of Syria to choose their own leaders by free and fair elections. Time is running out for the Baathist regime, and the international community must act decisively as it is likely according to the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that crimes against humanity have been committed. There is also looming danger that Syria may be plunged into a bloody civil war, with the Islamic Republic of Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia the other. I deeply regret the intransigence demonstrated by Russia and China at the United Nations Security Council in vetoing more hard-hitting sanctions against Damascus, and call for the High Representative to urgently increase her efforts to build an international consensus against the regime’s behaviour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
