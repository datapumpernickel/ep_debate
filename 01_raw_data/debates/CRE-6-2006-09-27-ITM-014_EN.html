<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries for the preparation of this report concerning the Commission’s proposal for a long-term plan for the management of plaice and sole fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important topic. Since the Commission first began discussing the long-term management of these stocks and fisheries in 2004, there has been a significant worsening of the state of these stocks. In particular, the size of the sole stock is now declining rapidly due to low numbers of incoming young fish. High fuel prices and lower catch rates have combined to create a very difficult situation for this sector and this fits very well into what I have been saying before.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is intended to reverse this trend by leading to more efficient and more profitable fisheries and I am keen to see it adopted soon so that fisheries can begin to recover and to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, therefore, for this report and I now turn to the specific amendments that you propose. I can support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 18 and 21. However, I should mention that the Commission has already begun a debate, as requested in Amendment 4, with the regional advisory councils concerning the implementation of maximum sustainable yield management and has also already arranged for the impact assessment foreseen in Amendment 5. The final text should reflect the fact that these measures requested by Parliament have already taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept in principle that there could be a two-step approach in long-term plans, and that different measures would apply in situations where stocks are outside safe biological limits from those applicable in situations where stocks are within those limits. Therefore, I can accept the principles behind Amendments 1, 7, 9 and 10. However, it is important to improve the state of the stock and the finances of the industry. More consultations with the sector and the Member States concerned will be needed to refine the details, as will careful consideration of the results of the impact analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support provisions to revise long-term targets at periodic intervals of about five years in order to take account of changes in the environment and the ecosystems. However, I am not in a position to accept Parliament’s amendments intended to provide stability for the industry by setting TACs that are stable for three-year periods. Stability for the industry can better be provided by limiting changes to TACs between years. The North Sea RAC has revised its opinion on this topic and in its latest advice no longer advises such a measure. Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment 8, the second paragraph of Amendment 9, nor Amendments 10, 11 and 24.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment 12, I can accept the widening of scope to include a wider definition of fishing effort for plaice and sole, though a more precise legal wording may be necessary. However, here again, I cannot support a proposal that effort limits be adapted only at three-yearly intervals.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment 13, a legislative text for a long-term plan must define clearly how efforts should be adjusted in order to achieve the targets of the plan. Parliament’s text does not seem clear enough from a legal and technical point of view. Advice from scientific committees indicates that significant amounts of cod are caught and are discarded.</p>
<p class="contents">As the plaice and sole fisheries exert mortality on cod, it is necessary to keep this mortality under review and to adjust relevant efforts if necessary. This is why I am not in a position to accept Amendment 14, because it would create a non-equitable situation in comparison with other fisheries sectors that also have an impact on cod and are subject to cod-recovery measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 15 asks for a change in the log-book tolerance from 8% to 10%. However, the 8% figure was adopted in the Council as a common value in other long-term plans after a long discussion. I believe this figure should be retained for plaice and sole as for the other long-term plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The practical implementation of Amendments 16 or 17 would require that fisheries inspectors be able to distinguish between plaice or sole caught in the North Sea and fish of these species caught in other areas, a task which does not seem possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept the principle and intentions behind Amendments 6, 19, 22 and 23, but I believe it should be implemented in a different way. The Commission is preparing an evaluation of technical measures and the regulation of fishing gears should be reviewed as soon as possible in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">If either plaice or sole enters into biologically very high-risk situations, the Council should be more cautious in setting fishing opportunities. This is consistent with the guiding principles of the common fisheries policy and will provide additional protection to stocks that are in their most vulnerable state. For this reason, I cannot accept Amendment 20.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I thank Parliament for its careful scrutiny of this document. Raising and addressing the issues I have just mentioned will, I am sure, improve the quality and efficiency of the regulation that is eventually agreed in order to achieve the objective of improving the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stocks of plaice and sole, as well as reducing discarding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I share his concern with regard to the development of the plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea, it is at the same time becoming clear that this is not related to the fishing effort, but may be attributable to climate changes that cannot always be fully explained. To make it absolutely clear, though, I do share his concern in this respect. I am pleased that he is nevertheless moving towards Parliament in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point of criticism that I made with regard to the Commission’s working method was that the proposal was tabled before the North Sea Regional Advisory Council had issued its recommendation. That does not strike me as going about things the right way. It appears to me essential that, if we want to retain a support base for fisheries, we should accord these Regional Advisory Councils a fully-fledged place in the debate and that we get them to make a contribution prior to the debate as well. I am saying this emphatically because those Regional Advisory Councils not only involve fisheries organisations, but also the Word Nature Fund and other nature organisations. That is precisely the sort of thing that injects stability and provides a support base for policy in a certain region.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the application of the objectives for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), I am pleased that the Commission has just now issued the communication on that subject which was still missing prior to the management plan for sole and plaice, although it had, in fact, already presented the MSY objectives. My criticism is mainly to do with the fact that that did happen for sole and plaice, but not for a number of other management plans, for example the Gulf of Biscay.</p>
<p class="contents">It also strikes me as the right way of doing things if we in this House have a fundamental discussion about the application of the MSY objectives before these are introduced for a certain fish species. I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is taking a few steps in the right direction, but there may need to be more consultation in a number of other areas. I also hope that the Council will as yet move a little closer in the direction of Parliament to ensure that we in any event end up with a balanced approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has stated that the establishment of three-year quotas is a problem for him after all, because they do not allow any <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> adjustments. I would question that, also because sole and plaice fisheries may well be the best controlled fisheries in Europe, and also on the basis of the way in which the fisheries organisations use these. I would draw your attention to, among others, the producer organisations in a number of ports that work closely together and where there is excellent cooperation between the Member States, the authorities, the inspectorates and the fisheries organisations themselves. It would, in fact, be appealing, also for the European Commission, in time, to switch to a three-year Total Allowable Catches (TAC) scheme after all.</p>
<p class="contents">I may be prejudging the discussion on the communication about the Commission’s MSY objectives, but the point that is essential in my view is that Regional Advisory Councils will be given a dominant role in Europe's decision-making, that they, every time the Commission tables a proposal, will be given a hearing beforehand, and that their opinion will be taken into consideration in the argumentation of the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, we will increasingly have discussions in Europe, also within fisheries, in which, seemingly, a large number of Member States take hardly any interest. Indeed, the number of Member States is no longer 6 or 15, but 25. And how could a Hungarian Fisheries Minister contribute to a discussion, say, about shrimps in the North Sea or a Dutch Fisheries Minister about fisheries around Cyprus?</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, general policy lines, but in order to keep a support base for fisheries, it is essential for these Regional Advisory Councils to be accorded an important role, also in future, also in the implementation of the plans. That is why this point receives a great deal of attention in my report too. It can provide a support base for the fisheries decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important, however, is the following. We are often in a fix with scientific recommendations for the establishment of quotas and subsequently – let us be honest about this – find out that the Council plays under one hat. That is why scientific recommendations are drafted conservatively to take the Council’s outcome into consideration. We must put a stop to this! We must ensure that the sector and scientific institutions cooperate much quicker and at a much earlier stage in order to weigh up the plans effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should once again like to express my thanks to the Commissioner for meeting us half-way on a number of issues. Parliament’s position will be apparent in tomorrow’s vote. I am firmly convinced that the Commissioner will place Parliament’s contribution at the heart of the Council’s discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that when we look at fisheries, especially at catching plaice and sole – and basically they are mixed fisheries because other species are being caught, cod included – we have to be much more radical than we are at the moment. The Commissioner knows that full well and I have raised the issue of discards in general with him several times. Let us land all the fish that are caught, instead of having so many species quotas with the result that a lot of healthy fish are discarded. Of all the problems with the common fisheries policy, throwing healthy fish overboard is the one that the general public in Europe see as particularly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think we must be sure that powers are devolved to the North Sea Advisory Council and that the Commission takes notice of it. Mr Maat made the point that it is no good the Commission coming up with a proposal before it has taken note of what the North Sea Advisory Council has said. That gives people the impression that the Commission is not listening. I also think that with the age-old problem of stocks in general there is always a conflict between the scientific advice and what the fishermen believe the stocks to be. It is not always easy to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is – and I stress the need to be more radical – that I think the way forward is to look at the total quotas of fish caught and see if we cannot change that into days at sea and fishing effort, so that we can land all the fish caught. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, Estonia, fishing is more than just an industry or a means of earning a living. Fishing is an integral part of our culture. In a country surrounded by water on three sides, it could not be otherwise. I know families that have been involved in fishing for many generations. For them, fishing is not a business project, but a way of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial fishing has brought the lives of coastal fishermen to the brink of disaster. According to the World Wildlife Foundation, the flounder and sole mentioned today are among the most endangered fish species. Half of the flounders caught using beam trawling prove to be undersized and must be thrown back. Most of these fish perish. Such waste is incomprehensible to fishermen whose families have been in the business for generations. It is clear that the use of wasteful fishing methods should be ended sooner rather than later. I hope that the European Commission will be able to conduct the relevant research as soon as possible and present proposals for the rapid replacement of existing fishing methods with naturally sustainable methods. I am well aware that the nature of fisheries does not permit as quick a response as would be possible in information technology management, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the report’s recommendation to establish three-year fishing quotas instead of one-year quotas. This will ensure continuity in the fisheries. In ensuring continuity and sustainability, close cooperation with organisations that are familiar with local conditions will be very important. Of these, the rapporteur emphasises the North Sea Regional Advisory Council. The attempts to restore fishing stocks in the Baltic Sea, which feeds fishermen from five Member States, would be much more successful if they were supported by regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Baltic Sea, I would like to emphasise here today that the Baltic Sea region deserves a separate entry in the European Union budget, as has long been the case in the Mediterranean region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When safe biological limits are being exceeded, we all expect action and I commend the action that is being taken. I also commend the attempt to move towards a policy of achieving maximum sustainable yields. I do not see how anyone can be opposed to that. It is like apple pie and motherhood.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty is how we move from the present disaster to future perfection, without disrupting the lives and occupations of fishermen to an impossible degree. That is my doubt about this particular policy. The purpose of the Regional Advisory Councils is to try and ensure that fishermen are integrated into the process. So when their advice seems to be being ignored, it may be the wrong advice. Perhaps that is the Commission’s fault for not communicating the message. It is the opportunity for greater long-term prosperity. Fishermen, as we all know, need to be included in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner when he says that we must go for only one-year quotas. The danger is that if we set a quota at the wrong level, in three years’ time there may be no more fish to set the next quota for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Mr Maat’s report is, for the most part, sound, but I would criticise precisely the same things as the Commissioner. Amendment 8 about having a three-year quota would have precisely those implications pointed out by Mr Davies. It could not be adapted in time and would be inappropriate. The same applies in the case of cod. There is a connection here, which means that Amendment 14 cannot be approved either. If the number of days at sea is to be limited for the reason stated, the restriction will have to apply to these vessels too, as there cannot be exceptions where this matter is concerned. When it comes to Amendment 15, involving a ten per cent, instead of eight per cent, margin of tolerance, I would point out that, with modern computer technology, there would be no complications in having an eight per cent margin. We could manage to calculate eight per cent instead of ten per cent. Increased flexibility would damage stocks. The same applies to Amendment 20. Increased flexibility for the Member States in determining when they need to take measures would not work. Attempts to obtain increased flexibility would actually lead to reduced flexibility, as, if fish stocks are depleted, there is no flexibility at all left. There would then be no fishing quotas, no days at sea and 100% unemployment among professional fishermen. That, presumably, is what no one wants to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They achieved a sustainable industry by care, not by chance. Then we joined the EC, and that all changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The wretched CFP, with its bureaucratic plans, crazy quotas and enforced discards has reduced stocks to their lowest level ever, closed fishing ports and reduced the UK fishing fleet to a quarter of its size. Many species are down to danger levels – plaice and sole today, something else tomorrow. And to think that the CFP was not even in the Treaty of Rome: it was invented overnight to let Edward Heath have something to give away in exchange for the right to sign!</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in answer to the desperate shortage of fish in the North Sea, all we hear about is too many boats chasing too few fish – I’ll say! They are mostly boats from Spain, which has a fleet as big as the rest of the EU put together. No wonder the Norwegians said no! They saw it coming, and with their fishing industry such a boost to their economy, they were right. Norwegian stocks remain in good order. Are there any lessons for the CFP there?</p>
<p class="contents">This report will do nothing. While the management plan acknowledges the North Sea Advisory Council, it ignores its findings. It is inconsistent in departing from similar decisions in areas like the Bay of Biscay, and it is based on a maximum sustainable yield before that is even defined.</p>

<p class="contents">On the one hand we have the Commission’s explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea. Then, on the other hand, in its document the Commission makes no further reference to the NSRAC’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could tell me who is or was responsible for drafting the Commission’s management plan. How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC? As has been stated and restated time and time again, forums such as the NSRAC were established in order to canvass and to utilise the wide body of expertise and opinion among people on the ground, people on the coalface, people who know the industry and to counteract the perception that Brussels or Strasbourg make policies which are often seen as ‘about you, without you’. Is it any wonder that people turn off Brussels or Strasbourg?</p>
<p class="contents">The NSRAC has provided a bridgehead for bringing fishing interests, biologists and environmentalists together, getting them to agree collectively on ways of conserving stocks of plaice and sole. The proposals, if adopted, would increase the level of plaice stocks to above the precautionary levels of three to five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the rapporteur has other reservations about the Commission’s approach, with which I agree, but time restraints do not permit me to elaborate on them, except to make a brief reference to the issue of MSY – maximum sustainable yields. The Commission’s proposal to launch a debate on MSY in advance of agreement by the Council and Parliament simply is not on.

<p class="contents">Let me start by trying to clear the air with regard to the North Sea Regional Advisory Council. The Commission has held a series of consultation meetings and exchanges of views since June 2004. I do not believe that any other fisheries issue has been the subject of such extensive dialogue with the RACs. After the North Sea RAC decided to reserve its position until the Commission had made a specific proposal concerning long-term management targets and reference points, the Commission stated that it would put forward a proposal and even inform the RAC of its technical content at a meeting in November 2005. A discussion has since proceeded in good order on the basis of the Commission’s proposal. I am pleased that the North Sea RAC has recognised that many elements of the Commission’s proposal are valuable and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding maximum sustainable yields, a number of stocks were brought into long-term management plans some years ago, which included low-target fishing mortalities, such as mackerel, herring and, more recently, haddock. These plans have proved valuable and helpful to the industries concerned. I believe similar benefits can be extended to the flatfish sector. Discussions concerning the maximum sustainable yield should also take place, but that is a wider-scale issue. The immediate concern is to provide the flatfish fishery with a sound economic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the point raised concerning TACs for three years, I must again underline that a three-year TAC would not help to recover the stock, simply because adjustments cannot be made in good time. How can one make adjustments mid-course if there is an urgent reason to reduce the TAC? The North Sea RAC has revised its position and it no longer advises such a measure. I can accept the argument that a three-year TAC will give greater security to fishermen, but not the argument that a three-year TAC would mean greater sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to discards, we are actively considering what can be done to solve this problem. It is one of the top priorities for the remainder of my mandate. I cannot agree more with Mr Davies that fishermen need to be integrated into the process. We are doing our utmost to meet with and consult all fishing representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
