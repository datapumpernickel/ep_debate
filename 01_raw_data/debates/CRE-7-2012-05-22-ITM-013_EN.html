<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marielle de Sarnez,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of my report, ‘EU and China: unbalanced Trade?’, accurately conveys the issue we are now facing, with China destined to become the leading world power before the turn of the next century.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between China and Europe are unbalanced. I would remind you that our trade deficit with China has more than tripled in 10 years. This is the challenge that faces us then, because with the European economy now apparently slowing down and setbacks in growth, there is reason to fear that it is no longer able to compete globally with its erstwhile confidence and drive. The framework that shapes our future has been turned on its head. It is up to us to redefine it, not by turning inward, which would only result in ruin, but by building a new partnership with China, the guidelines of which will ultimately be simple to define: reciprocal rules, balanced trade and transparent trade relations. I say this with all the more conviction because, in an open global economy, China needs Europe as much as Europe needs China. I say this with all the more certainty because I believe that now, during these times of crisis, is the time to forge deeper relations based on a more balanced partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks in particular to the work of the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for the opinions whom I commend, this report by the Committee on International Trade sets the framework and defines its requirements. These include encouraging China to open up its markets to European companies and accede to the multilateral Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). It also includes tempering the Chinese system of joint ventures and strategic technology transfers, promoting EU-China customs cooperation to combat counterfeiting. It includes encouraging the European Union to make use wherever necessary of trade defence instruments and more effectively defending the interests of European industry by reviewing the directive on intellectual property rights. It includes demanding strict compliance with European rules and standards for all Chinese goods in circulation on the internal market. It includes urging the Commission to negotiate a fair yet ambitious EU-China investment agreement, which guarantees transparency. It includes levelling out monetary competition with a coordinated system that identifies the holders of sovereign debt and encourages China to let the yuan set its own value. It also includes taking action to ultimately reform the World Trade Organisation to encompass compliance with social, health and environmental standards</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to stress one last important point. All this would be in vain, however, should the EU refuse to implement a concerted policy of production and reindustrialisation, as well as a policy of research and innovation that met the new global challenges. I would also like to add one more requirement, one that is absolutely vital, and that is better coordination between Member States so that bilateral relations between China and any one of them do not weaken the Union’s position. On this issue of relations with China, as in many others, but especially this one, Europe needs to speak with one voice, and to have and defend a single policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, by adopting this report, we are giving the Commission and the Council a coherent road map that can restore the balance in our relations with China and respond effectively to the deep concerns of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, this was indeed a very important presentation that Ms de Sarnez has given us and I know also that four Parliament committees have contributed to this important work – important because China is a very topical issue and essential for our foreign trade interests. Parliament’s views on these links are obviously a crucial part of our platform in the dialogue with China.</p>
<p class="contents">I can agree with many of the specific findings in the report. China is increasingly driving global growth at a difficult time for the international economy, and it is our fastest growing export market. But, at the same time, the list of issues we need to address with China grows longer, and the report is right in suggesting that there is a general feeling in Europe that economic openness in China is not improving enough. This highlights some of our concerns with China. Let me go through some of these.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for EU interests to have improved intellectual property rights’ enforcement in China. European companies excel in cutting-edge technologies and this is part of our competitive advantage. It is a fact that IPR infringements undermine not only European investment and engagement in China but just as much China’s ambition to develop its economy. We should therefore redouble our efforts on IPR and we will use this report as a useful guide in addressing this with China.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the report that we should aim for an ambitious and balanced investment agreement with China. Important sectors in China remain restricted for foreign investment and I believe that Europe’s open investment regime remains our strongest argument for others to grant us similar access. At the EU-China summit in February, we agreed to move towards bilateral investment negotiations. Market access in China will be part of this, as will the way our investments are treated in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also states that we need to strengthen transparency regarding foreign direct investment in Europe. I agree with this in principle, but also we need to be careful not to create new investment barriers at a time when Europe needs to remain attractive to maintain growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s view on access to the public procurement market in China underlines why the Commission is pushing for China to accede to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Limited and unbalanced access to many procurement markets globally is also why the Commission has proposed an external procurement instrument which aims at ensuring better reciprocity in the way our companies can get access to foreign markets, compared with the open access they enjoy in the EU. With such an instrument, we can have a better platform for addressing procurement concerns with China.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report rightly notes, it is crucial for European businesses that we vigilantly defend our interests whenever trade rules are not respected. We are doing this with anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruments and we have resorted to the WTO when that was necessary, for example, to address restrictions on access to raw materials and rare earths. On the question of whether China can obtain market economy status, I can only insist that this depends mainly on China itself, as it has to meet a number of objective criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is important that the report also points to a path forward. Even if our long-term vision for a strategic partnership with China can come under pressure from day-to-day issues, it is important that we keep in mind the vast potential for European businesses in China, and this raises the question of how we in Europe engage in China and with China. It is essential that the Commission, Parliament, the Member States, and the EU actors pass a coherent message to our respective Chinese counterparts. Only in this way will the EU be able to deal effectively with the different aspects of our trade relations with China and only in this way will we progress towards a stronger, deeper, and more balanced relationship with maximum mutual benefits for both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, China is often criticised in the European Parliament for its human rights situation, for what we call social and environmental dumping, and for breaches of the law, particularly in the area of intellectual property, and we criticise China where this is deserved, of course. In criticising China, however, we must ensure that we do not avoid correcting our own faults, as – and this has been heard more today than in previous debates – we can only have an equal relationship with China if we are a competitive European Union in which economic growth is also secured. That is the first issue, and we must also make an effort in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that China has long since ceased to be a developing country. It is a different country from the one of 10 years ago. It is an economic and political superpower with a highly attractive and competitive market, and we can also see major changes in the country’s social structure. Ultimately, China is, in its own way, an entire continent and not just another country, so we must treat it as an equal partner. In my opinion, we have much to gain from this equal partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China has an ever increasing impact on today’s global economy and thus also has an enormous responsibility when it comes to adhering to social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The respect of human and social rights as part of the cooperation between Europe and China is also essential. In this regard, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the efforts made by the Chinese central and local authorities. However, we would point out that sustainably funding a stable social security and health system that benefits all the country’s provinces to the same extent is one of the biggest challenges facing the Chinese Government in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Strict and effective monitoring of compliance with the legislation governing working conditions is also necessary, even in times of economic crisis. It is not our job to be constantly lecturing China, but we can help it establish new systems by exchanging experience and working methods. We would also point out the responsibility of Western companies that operate in China.</p>

However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Overall, it is a good report that draws attention to some significant problems: technical barriers to trade, non-technical barriers to trade, problems involving rare earth elements, and so on – circumstances that I myself pointed out in my capacity as rapporteur for this area in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that I nonetheless have some concerns regarding the report is due to its heavy emphasis on reciprocity. As a liberal and an advocate of free trade, I think this is the wrong road to go down. Reciprocity is an incredibly emotionally charged word that means something very different to different people, so to require reciprocity would be akin to throwing a grenade into the negotiations with China. It can only be interpreted as meaning that the EU wants to close its markets to the same extent as China, which would be tantamount to a trade war.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me state that I have nothing against imposing requirements on our trade partners and using the strength of the EU, but I feel that we have to be cautious about using the word reciprocity. For that reason, I would have preferred wording along the lines of creating equal and fair competitive conditions, or a level playing field as we call it – which is the term that I myself used in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her job was not easy because a wide range of views were incorporated into amendments and compromise amendments, but ultimately – and I speak on behalf of the PPE – we find most of our ideas in this report. The word ‘reciprocity’ was the key word used by everybody, and there is only one possible sense of that word: it refers to the fact that the European Union is open, and that China should be open and should reciprocate the openness of the European Union. That much is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Several controversial issues for us are addressed in the report, notably, the questions of the public procurement market, joint ventures and the possibility for foreign companies to have a presence on the Chinese market. Of course, the matter of intellectual property rights is one of the hot potatoes of the moment, but that is an evergreen in EU-China relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the crystal clear statement made here a few minutes ago by Commissioner Reding, who stated that EU recognition of market economy status depends on China itself. I think that is, or should be, the position of this House too, and the Commission should ensure that it is translated into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional framework for EU-China relations requires attention. We have a multiplicity of redundant institutional frameworks, so let us take care of that. Let us speak with one European Union voice in our relations with China, and also with the other BRICs.</p>

<p class="contents">The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.</p>

I fully support the initiative undertaken by the Commission to secure better investment rules and relations between the EU and China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my support depends on the following conditions: the securing of appropriate market access for EU investment in China – and we have heard about that from Mr Rinaldi – and the establishment of appropriate rules to attract support and Chinese investment into the European Union. I think it is important to note that, while caution felt towards China can be justified, we must stop seeing China purely as a threat to our growth and recognise the opportunities that a strong China-EU relationship can bring.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true when it comes to fostering new partnerships in the development of new-generation energy, technology, etc. I know, Commissioner, we have had our disagreements about Huawei, but it is a company which has invested tremendously in Europe, and I see that as a huge opportunity for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination in trade practices should not be tolerated, and should not give rise to a tit-for-tat mentality that simply leads to greater imbalances. A shift away from openness will hinder the development of any mutually beneficial relationships and, as you know, Commissioner, as a believer in the free market, I believe openness should underpin all trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that more open, transparent trade relations will develop, and that these will lead to a greater respect for the rule of law, especially in the field of international trade. Commissioner, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaty. It is in your power to propose regulations to stop or control dumping, to control standards and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Winkler mentioned something very important, a great problem for us: the situation of counterfeiting. We have a piece of legislation coming up, ACTA, which will help, and you have my full support in your position on that. I know it is difficult but let us hope that we can stop counterfeiting. It is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, that is not something that we should want in any case. China is our second largest trading partner, the second largest economy in the world and it has been seeing astonishingly strong growth for years. That provides unrivalled opportunities for European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have concerns, though, which I also see reflected in the solid report produced by Ms de Sarnez. European companies have to face a great many obstacles on the Chinese market, and China’s ambitions when it comes to lifting these barriers do not appear to be very high. I am thus issuing an urgent call to both partners to set to work on this. Reciprocity – and this has been mentioned quite often this evening already – needs to be the key word in the mutual relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission needs to continue pressing China to live up to its WTO obligations: allowing European companies a level playing field, protecting intellectual property rights and eliminating other trade barriers, such as restricted access to raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to wish Commissioner De Gucht a great deal of tenacity in his negotiations and in struggling for a level playing field with our Chinese trading partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms. However, all of this can only take place in the context of developing a common, agreed strategy for cooperation in a genuinely globalised world economy. To achieve this, we need intelligent, forward-looking initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the Chinese have defined renewable energies, and by no means just photovoltaics, as a strategic growth industry and are taking extensive measures to ensure that they have a technological advantage, to establish the industry in their own country and to become heavily involved in the industry by means of ownership and dumping issues. We are aware of the problem that, especially in the field of renewable energies, so-called European partners have only been allowed to own 20% of joint ventures. That figure has now been slightly increased, but nevertheless we are seeing competitive dumping on a massive scale, specifically in the wind energy industry. The photovoltaics sector has already been discussed. A total of 40 state-owned Chinese companies are being given what by international standards amounts to very one-sided preferential treatment, and we are aware of the complaints that have been made by the US, because China wants to establish pioneering businesses at a national level and is disregarding many of the principles of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic aspect of this situation is that the European Union is once again taking action too late in a growth market, a market of the future. Ultimately, this will come back to haunt us via the votes of our citizens, who do not understand what is happening. This is why I am making an urgent call for the European Union to focus on the industries of the future in its trade relations and to take much tougher measures in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am constantly shocked to discover that in one of the large Member States of the European Union, for example in Germany, which has a population of 80 million, many citizens are still not aware of how important it is for the European Union to speak with one voice on foreign policy and foreign trade policy. The 1.3 billion people in China are totally uninterested in what even 80 million German people think about a specific subject. Therefore, I am very, very grateful that foreign trade policy is an area which the European Union is responsible for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give Ms de Sarnez my strong support for her statements on a number of critical points. The degree of access which our businesses have to the Chinese market is totally unacceptable in some areas and has nothing at all to do with how open our European market is to Chinese businesses. However, we expect the Chinese to also open up their markets. This applies in general to all products, but also to public procurement. When it comes to investment, I am particularly concerned that we are still in a situation where investment in certain areas is totally regulated by the state, that obstacles are being placed in the path of European companies and that mandatory technology transfers have been taking place for some years. Mr De Gucht, in all the discussions that the European Union and you yourself have had in recent years with the Chinese, you have hardly made any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would be very grateful if we could at last begin to move forwards in the forthcoming dialogue on an investment protection agreement. We need fair rules and equality. In recent weeks, I have fortunately encountered on several occasions Chinese investors who are investing in Europe. They can do this because our market is open and because it is also open to Chinese investment. I would be very pleased if, in the next few weeks, we could make progress on the issue of how European companies can do business on the Chinese market, how they can invest there and how they can purchase goods and materials there without having to hand over their technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">China’s importance as a strategic partner for the European Union is well known, but as with all relationships, it has its issues. One of those is trade imbalance and this report deals with it well.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as Chinese investments benefit from easy penetration thanks to our opening up of the European market and our clear regulations, European companies often encounter difficulties in accessing the Chinese market, particularly, as we are all also aware, in public procurement, banking and telecommunications, among other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the report stresses the need to rebalance the relationship between the European Union and China. For that to occur, there is an acknowledged need for the Commission and the Member States to improve their coordination to strengthen our position with China in the most sensitive areas. Whilst there are Member States that relate freely with China, the work of the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht will be more difficult and our position will be weakened. We can only reset the balance of our relationships with China if we act together.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that China is a strategic partner for the European Union and can play a leading role in exiting the crisis suffered in Europe in recent years. However, it is also a fierce competitor and the object of disputes: the violation of World Trade Organisation rules, dumping, intellectual property rights, etc. For that reason, the report questions China automatically being awarded market economy status in 2016.</p>
<p class="contents">We need clarity on this issue to be able to do business with our Chinese business partners under the best conditions. I was going to ask the Commission for their opinion of China automatically being awarded market economy status, but as I have already heard – I am finishing, Mr President – Commissioner Reding already give her thoughts on it, I have nothing further to ask. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">China undoubtedly bears primary responsibility for the decline of European industrial policy. Suffocated by the invasion of cheap Asian products, our companies are cut out of the market. The result is that those that can, relocate, probably to China itself; those who cannot, close down.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop talking and start acting. We must combat this phenomenon, for the price of failure is too high in economic and, above all, social terms. China is growing, with a GDP of 8%, exploiting its workers and producing in an unregulated fashion; meanwhile, in Europe, as many as 23 million people are now out of work, and tens of thousands more can expect to lose their jobs. Where I come from, the Veneto region, in the first few months of 2012, companies like Safilo, Redi and Ditec decided to relocate, leaving thousands of employees without work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is very much in the interest of many Member States, driven by the dark forces of finance, to pretend not to understand the consequences of this unbalanced kind of trade for the European economy. Those of us who represent European citizens must put people first and safeguard jobs, through protected designations of origin, by fighting counterfeiting and relocation, and by imposing duty. That is the only way to give Europe’s market back to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China does not respect its international commitments, any more this year than it did last year. It exercises large-scale dumping in all areas, it makes a mockery of intellectual property as it does the concept of first dollar, it seizes raw materials from developing countries, it heavily subsidises its businesses and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Being weak in the face of such behaviour has resulted in the deindustrialisation of Europe, companies relocating, millions of jobs being lost and our markets being flooded with poor quality goods.</p>
<p class="contents">China should not have entered the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the European Commission seemed to be more concerned with implementing free-trade dogmas rather than ensuring the full employment of Europeans. We will never compete with a country where most workers earn less than EUR 70 per month. We will never win if years of effort to increase the competitiveness of our businesses are ruined in a matter of hours by the speculative rise of the Reichsmark, sorry, I mean the euro! I feel sorry for Ms de Sarnez, because everything that she is proposing – usually emergency and common sense measures – will only ever be a stopgap. For as long as we stay in a globalised, finance-driven, ultra-liberal system, we will only be able to reindustrialise our countries sheltered by the sensible and intelligent protection of our economies, by promoting and implementing a strong national and European preference that demands, for all our imports, the same respect for social and environmental standards that we impose on our own producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I do not think protectionism is a solution. Greater competitiveness in Europe – this is how to compete with the Chinese economy, and it does not have to mean competing on the basis of paying the lowest possible wages.</p>
<p class="contents">China is the European Union’s second most important economic partner, and we are the most important partner for China. China is a key source of our imports, and the fact that China and the EU are the two largest economies in the world testifies to the importance of the problem of which we are speaking here. Finally, I would like to make one more point: when we are considering questions of economic relations with China, which, without doubt, are of crucial importance for the future of the economy – ours and China’s – let us never forget that our trading relations must also include an element of protection for human rights, and the situation on this is a continual problem if we are talking about Chinese society and the Chinese State. When doing business, let us not forget that we should expect equal standards, and not just equal social and environmental standards, but also equal standards concerning respect for fundamental human rights, including in the great country of China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also consider it to be a good report. That does not mean to say that I would sign up to everything in it, but I do think it is a good report which has focused on what is important: and as everyone has said, the issue of reciprocity is extremely important, with fair competition and clear rules; there is also everything that has been said about intellectual property rights, counterfeiting and piracy – issues I would gladly sign up to –, including urging the Chinese to introduce international rules in their legislation and ensuring that they are implemented; one final significant matter is getting European companies that have managed to penetrate the Chinese market to lead by example in terms of social and environmental standards – all of which is important – and, then, asking the Commission to improve bilateral coordination of its policies with China.</p>
<p class="contents">What I like in this report, and I say this because we are going to meet the Chinese, is that it is a report based on respect. It is a report that is honest, that is direct, that is respectful, and I think it is written in a language that our Chinese friends can understand, and even demand. I would all the same remind you that this is a great country, in every sense of the word, with nearly a billion and a half people, which has managed to get a third of its population out of poverty in a very short time and which, now, must do its utmost – and I, like my fellow Members, stress this, but with the greatest of respect – to tackle both the issue of social standards and human rights. China knows this. It has included some of these matters in its five-year plan, and we will be ready to discuss all these issues without any taboo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope the Chinese are grateful. Well, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I suppose they are: 85% of all pirated goods seized in the EU in 2010 came from China. The West has inflicted much of the harm itself, as nearly all of China’s export trade has been supplied by companies established with Western technology and expertise to compete with our industries and throw our workers on the scrap heap. In the words of the Committee on Industry, there is a ‘temptation for European enterprises to relocate their operations to China in order to cut their costs and increase their profits, to the detriment of the EU workforce’.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of Europe must act to protect their manufacturing and the jobs of their peoples. The problem is that EU countries, individually and collectively, have embraced the economic ideology of globalism, while China is, quite understandably, pursuing a policy of economic nationalism. A policy of surrender at any cost will never be a match for a policy of victory at every cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the normal swansong which I think we are used to hearing when the EU talks about trade with China.</p>
<p class="contents">My father always used to say that anyone who stands in the way of progress will simply get run over. World trade and the world economy are very different now from when I was growing up. They will look even more different in 10, 15 or 20 years’ time. That is a fact and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that China now has such a strong presence in the international trade arena is ultimately a good thing, not just because of the human aspects and the eradication of poverty. It has also been of benefit to us, with increased exports, increased imports of cheap products and low inflation. Fundamentally, this depends on comparative advantages from China and the differences which promote trade. However, this does not mean that China always plays by the rules. On the contrary, China breaches many rules and, in these cases, we need to take particularly tough action. The Chinese have a lack of respect for intellectual property rights and we need to protest about this. Their policy on investment opportunities in China is poor, not to mention online protectionism in the form of the Great Firewall. We must combat all of these problems, but we must continue to accept Chinese exports. Despite everything, the EU is the world’s largest exporter to China and we benefit from trade with China. The most important thing for us to do to bring about a trade balance with China is to make use of our own competitiveness. If we want to change the trade balance, we should do our homework in Brussels and the other EU capitals, rather than visiting Beijing and the rest of China.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are opportunities for trade with China and, therefore, I am pleased that this report does more than simply highlight the problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, economic matters are not the only problem in EU-China relations. There is a huge imbalance in our relations – on the one hand, we have European firms operating in accordance with the principle of maximising profit, transferring their production to China or exporting to China or importing from China, and, on the other, we are dealing with a perfectly organised operation, directed in large measure for political purposes by a very strong Chinese State which has recently become much stronger and is operating on a worldwide scale. The Chinese are working extremely well, trading and investing in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Europe. The problem is that we have to answer a question which is not just about economics today, but also about politics: what are the consequences of this? It is clear to see – previous speakers have already made this point – that the Chinese do not always conform to the rules of international trade or to those standards which we would like to be universal. There is a great need for the European Union to concentrate its efforts and present a single position to China (and it does have the instruments to do this) so that the standards which are most important to us are respected by the Chinese, not just in relations with the European Union, but also in the context of investments in other parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is very timely given the economic crisis in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have to welcome the fact that China has lifted many of the barriers to trade and is more open to dialogue with the Western world. However, as the rapporteur said, there are definite problems. First of all, there is the huge imbalance between the manner in which the EU treats Chinese companies investing in Europe and the manner in which China treats EU companies investing in China. Not only is the situation bad, it is actually getting worse: 43% of the EU companies in Europe confirm that there is anti-EU discrimination; that should be set against a figure of 33% in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem areas have been outlined: first of all, public procurement. Secondly, EU investors are debarred, for example, from owning their own company. You must hand over at least half the ownership of your company if you establish in China. Thirdly, China accounts for 97% of the world production in commodities, and we know the problem in relation to rare earth exports. The WTO settlement body, for example, ruled against the Chinese practice in July 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">The sheer size, power and potential of China are absolutely phenomenal. Mr Sturdy put it very bluntly. He said we must focus on the positives. I have heard a lot of tough talk here. Let us be honest about it. We are not in a position to talk tough. We cannot bully the Chinese. At the end of the day, the name of the game has to be putting the hand out, freedom and rapprochement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to say that China is the world’s largest exporter of goods, the European Union’s second biggest trading partner and one of the most powerful economies in the world. It is also a country with a huge population. This all goes to show that in view of the problems brought on by the crisis, the EU must, if I may put it this way, reassess EU-China relations. Secondly, the Chinese make use of a number of measures, such as subsidies, price, monetary and social dumping, undervaluation of the yuan and tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. This therefore requires a reaction: attention should also be given to this very important matter, so that bilateral EU-China trade can be conducted under equal conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Union must be more active in its efforts to make the Chinese market more open to European businesses, in order to change the unfavourable imbalance and make the Chinese market a more friendly environment, particularly to European investment. Fourthly, there is an urgent need to eliminate all situations which involve violations of human rights in Chinese firms. Fifthly, it is also necessary to raise the question of corporate social responsibility as it applies to European businesses and their relations with China so that they put this idea into practice, because European firms which use facilities in the People’s Republic of China should apply EU standards of work and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the report ought to have also mentioned that EU agricultural policy has been entirely subject, ever since 1995, to the World Trade Organisation’s regulations, as well as that by decoupling this aid and allocating it to rural measures, the European Union has successfully transferred 88% of the aid granted to the WTO’s green box.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union manufacturers are obliged to comply with the highest quality, product hygiene and environmental standards. These factors must be taken into account whenever Parliament mentions our agricultural subsidies and the attitudes of our trade partners to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that it would have been useful to have had the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the subject of this report, which would have made important contributions to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several things emerge from it. First of all, if China respected the value of human life and took care of the environment, there would be a trade imbalance between China and the EU. Secondly, if China were a trusted partner, we should hope that negotiations and agreements would resolve this imbalance. Thirdly, even the Chinese communists have grasped the fact that investment without ideology in Africa is more effective than development assistance conditional on the adoption of the ideology of the donor. Fourthly, had we not lived in debt for years, maybe we could have done something, but since China provides us with credit, we can only talk about it, and then only quietly. And fifthly, this is the first official document that states directly that the Europe 2020 strategy is similar to the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the Chinese Communists.

I support this call. Striking a balance in mutual trade would lead to shared development as a result of mutual benefits. Despite clear progress, however, existing trade barriers still make it impossible to exploit the potential for economic cooperation. European companies still face a range of tariff and non-tariff barriers which hamper access to Chinese markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular lack the capacity to deal with the bureaucratic certification requirements or to take part in public tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">European consumers, on the other hand, are interested in the safety of the Chinese products flowing onto the common European market. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation with the Chinese authorities in the area of health protection. Let us therefore take the opportunity to convey our concerns to China regarding artificially created trade barriers and the general lack of transparency. Europe and China can move towards developing an equal and balanced partnership only through mutual cooperation and a coordinated approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to solar panels, we have already had contacts with the industry on this and when we receive a justified complaint – and we have not yet received one – we will consider appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, several Members of Parliament have raised the issue of a level playing field. We all agree that there should be a level playing field, but the question is how do you get there? Is it by taking action when appropriate but also keeping your own markets open, or is it by closing your own markets? And what would be the result of these differing strategies? I am very clearly in favour of having open markets, but also being tough when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That leads me to the market economy status. In fact, when you look at the conclusions of the latest EU-China summit, you will see there is a very clear link made between market economy status and export credits. What we are, in effect, saying is that we should make progress on both issues and China will have to move forward on export credits. They have promised that they will reach a multilateral agreement by 2014. I am greatly looking forward that. Qualifying for market economy status is a matter of meeting criteria, and if we want to be serious with this, we have to recognise they have not yet met these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Market economy status is not something that you can grant all of a sudden; this is a matter entailing a codecision procedure in which the European Parliament will also have its say if a conclusion is ever reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The investment agreement was also discussed at the latest summit, and we – China and ourselves – agreed to open negotiations. For the first time ever, China has recognised that negotiations should concern not only investment protection, but also market access. We at the European Commission are preparing negotiating directives, and we hope and expect that the Chinese will do the same when approaching their state council.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point on trade. Because people always focus on imports coming from China, I would like to make two remarks. First, there are also a lot of exports going to China; China is a very important market for us. Second, we should not forget that a large part of these imports are beneficial for our own economy because they concern products that we then re-export. We therefore have to import a lot to re-export afterwards, and a big part of these semi-finished products come from China.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary: a very interesting report; a very fruitful debate; a very complicated country but also with a lot of prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ultimately, they have allowed us to hear the concerns of European citizens. Europeans are concerned about China’s considerable influence in the global economy, its seemingly endless supply of low cost labour, the irresistible attraction it represents for investors and the risk it poses for the delocalisation of production, and rightly so. It is essential that we recognise this here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that we act, obviously not by closing borders but by showing what a heavyweight we really are, namely, the primary economic power in the world that is entering into dialogue with China as an equal, not reluctantly but with confidence and conviction, in order to find a balanced approach, means for reciprocity and conditions for fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new partnership with China that will facilitate a return to growth for Europe in the future and, in addition, economic development in China, with the view that this will help to advance freedoms in China.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore demand a great deal from China. We must speak with a single voice in our dealings with China in order to achieve balanced trade relations. Yet I think that we Europeans have our fair share of work to do. We must have a European strategy, particularly for production, for reindustrialisation and for research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has a strategy. They protect, Commissioner, entire swathes of their economy. China has a strategy. I am calling for the European Union to have a strategy too, not simply a defensive one but an offensive strategy aimed at moving forwards, one demanding fairer relations and, at the same time, working in our own territory on production, on wealth creation and protecting whole sectors for economic development, mirroring what giants such as the United States are doing.</p>

They rose by 39.5% between 2009 and 2010 alone. On the other hand, China is the EU’s number two trade partner. Furthermore, during the current sovereign debt crisis, China has played an important role through investments made in infrastructure programmes in Greece and its obvious readiness to provide financial support to Spain and Portugal. Therefore, we can no longer talk about an emerging economy, but about a global economic player.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I think that Europe’s strategy on China needs to be reviewed so that it incorporates both the opportunities provided by China’s rapid global ascent and the economic challenges which they entail. It is time to consolidate a partnership based on mutual benefit and, by extension, abandon the competitive mentality. At the same time, the Chinese economy is still failing to fulfil the criteria for a market economy, which makes it difficult for European operators to do business in the Chinese market. This is why I think that the World Trade Organisation is the institutional forum which can be used to redress this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over a 10-year span, it has more than tripled, jumping from EUR 50 billion to EUR 170 billion. This immense imbalance can only partly be explained by China being more competitive in terms of labour costs. As indicated in the report, this Asian country and the companies operating there engage in several forms of conduct contrary to international trade law and practices in order to gain further competitive advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since its accession to the WTO, China has been its greatest beneficiary and the true winner in globalisation. However, WTO membership entails not only benefits but also responsibilities. It is unacceptable that Beijing is supporting companies that produce for export by various means, such as through an export credit scheme. The US has recently adopted protective measures against Chinese dumping. The EU must protect European jobs, and should act with similar strictness against illegal imports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, for example, in the interest of the entire global economy that the Chinese Government stop keeping yuan exchange rates at artificially low levels in order to assist export companies. European enterprises that intend to export to China, including, in particular, distributors of agricultural products such as meat, are facing several technical and legal barriers that are unusual in international practice. China should create a predictable and transparent regulatory environment for third-country companies intending to export there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One source of this disparity is the way the Chinese State favours its own economy by creating certain difficulties for investors from the EU, such as by restricting the form in which it is possible to set up joint-venture businesses in China. This often serves as a protectionist measure because it debars foreign investors from becoming majority shareholders in Chinese companies and forces them to transfer technology, a practice which reduces the competitiveness of EU businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Another serious problem is the question of respect for intellectual property rights (IPRs). Until China introduces legislation which guarantees the protection of IPRs, the conditions for competition on an equal basis will not exist. Furthermore, I would like to point out that there are no substantive grounds for China to deplore the existence of supposed EU barriers in the form of agricultural subsidies for farmers or agricultural tariffs, bearing in mind that a whole range of analogous legal instruments exists on the Chinese side. We will support all changes intended to bring the Chinese economy closer to fulfilment of the criteria of a market economy as defined by the WTO and to eliminate mechanisms which give rise to an imbalance in bilateral trade with the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we must call on China to liberalise its trade even further and to open up its markets. The moves in this direction have been evaluated in the report as being inadequate because the investment conditions and the access to the Chinese market for European companies do not offer the same benefits that the EU gives to Chinese businesses. For this reason, we need to negotiate an ambitious and balanced investment agreement with China, in order to create a better environment for European investors there. It is important that the barriers which block access to the Chinese market are removed.

The key to bilateral relations between Europe and China should be partnership founded on reciprocity. On this basis, China could expect Europe to allow it equal and unrestricted access to its investment and public procurement markets, and this would benefit European consumers. However, the European Union must also demand the same rights for European investors and businesses operating in the Chinese market, and this means making it possible for them to receive the right training, orientation and support in looking for partners, and assistance in solving particular problems. In my opinion, these functions should be performed actively and without discrimination by appropriate units of the EU’s diplomatic service in China.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union will only have the opportunity to compete with China on an equal basis when it invests fully in scientific research and innovation, and so is able to develop the sectors whose products are most in demand on the Chinese market. The transfer of technology to China should always be compensated by the creation of innovations which will ensure permanent and sustainable demand for European industrial production. This should be given special consideration in the process of negotiating the financial allocations for particular sectors in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trade between the EU and China has shown three decades of continuous growth, giving both partners a high share of world trade. There is, however, one aspect of trade relations to which we should pay particular attention. For almost 15 years, there has been an imbalance in bilateral trade. This has been to the advantage of only one side, China, and it means that the trade deficit amounts to around EUR 170 billion in China’s favour.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should call the attention of the Commission to the need to apply the reciprocity principle in the EU’s common trade policy with China. Only in this way will we minimise the lack of full and fair competition caused by the fact that the Chinese economy does not fulfil the criteria of a market economy. Furthermore, the Union should require China to adopt international standards for products and services, which will foster transparency in bilateral trade and help improve the safety of products manufactured in China for European consumers. The growing imbalance in trade with China is a warning for the Union which demonstrates that without respect for the reciprocity principle in bilateral relations, Europe will become nothing more than an outlet for Chinese products and not a partner for the dynamically developing Chinese economy. This is why it is so important to restore the health of EU-China bilateral trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when global growth is slow, this dynamism should be a cause for celebration. However, on the contrary, it has given rise to concerns in Europe, as the Chinese miracle seems to be detrimental to our own economic development. While China is taking full advantage of the globalised economy by exporting its products and winning European public contracts, it is reluctant to allow the same to occur in its own territory. It reserves its public contracts for Chinese companies and prevents our key industries from agreeing to significant technological transfers in order to access Chinese private markets; we are therefore at risk of shooting ourselves in the foot! For this reason, the EU must put a stop to this naive trade relationship and act in a concerted fashion to impose the principle of reciprocity in its trade relations. If China wishes to continue to benefit from our market of 500 million consumers, it must adhere to international rules (open markets, intellectual property rights, free exchange rates), which it agreed to upon joining the WTO in 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
