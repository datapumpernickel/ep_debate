<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we are all aware of the fact that important decisions have to be taken at the coming European Council. These decisions will pave the way for a further enlarged European Union, as well as a further strengthening of policy areas that are of crucial importance for effective action by the European Union on the challenges facing the world of today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth round of enlargement did not end on 1 May this year. As reiterated by the European Council in June, Bulgaria and Romania are an integral part of it. In its regular reports in October, the Commission concluded that both countries should be ready to assume all membership obligations by 1 January 2007 and could sign the Accession Treaty early in 2005. The European Council is expected to agree on these conclusions. The accession negotiations with both countries were formally concluded at the accession conferences yesterday. At the same time, Bulgaria and Romania will be encouraged to maintain the pace of their reforms until the time of accession. Close monitoring by the Commission will assist them in their preparations for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the final steps for the fifth round of enlargement. The European Council will tackle the framework for future accession negotiations and the individual accession candidacies of Croatia and Turkey. In the future, specific frameworks for negotiations with each candidate country will take into account the experience of the past enlargement as well as the individual merits of the candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, the European Council is expected to welcome its progress in preparing for the opening of accession negotiations, but also to urge Croatia to take the necessary steps for full cooperation with ICTY. The remaining indictee must be located and transferred to The Hague as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, the European Council will assess whether it fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. On the basis of this assessment, the European Council is expected to take a decision as to whether to start accession negotiations with Turkey, while also providing for a framework for these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">1.1. </span><span class="bold">As we know only too well, terrorism is and remains one of the greatest threats to all our societies. That is why the Netherlands presidency has made security one of the main issues of its presidency. The June European Council agreed on a new EU Action Plan to combat terrorism. Now it will take stock of progress. There is no room for complacency, but overall we can be satisfied: considerable progress has been made, both inside the EU and in our external relations. This is shown by the updated EU Action Plan and several reports, dealing with specific issues of counter-terrorism measures.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council has agreed on setting up a border agency. Passports will be safer through the use of biometrics. National capacity of anti-terrorism services will be strengthened and stricter controls on cash entering and leaving the Union to combat the financing of terrorism have been agreed upon. In order to integrate intelligence capacity within the Council, the Situation Centre has been enlarged and a secure communications link with Europol has been established. Member States will exchange information from criminal records, Europol and Eurojust will be better informed by Member States concerning terrorist offences and there will be closer cooperation with selected third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also mention the Hague Programme on freedom, security and justice, adopted by the European Council on 5 November, which in the coming years will contribute substantially to the fight against terrorism. This does not mean, however, that we can sit back – on the contrary! The EU remains vulnerable and there is still much work to be done in implementing the EU Action Plan. In the next six months the EU will therefore continue its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Multiannual Strategic Programme 2004-2006 issued a clear mandate to the Netherlands presidency to take a decision on principles and guidelines in order to enable the EU to achieve political agreement on the financial perspectives by June 2005. Six months of intense discussions under the Netherlands presidency have resulted in clear principles and guidelines. They provide for a framework for the Council to reach a general political agreement. The principles and guidelines will be accompanied by an elaborate progress report, which constitutes an overview of the positions of Member States based on the legislative proposals, communications and further technical clarifications by the Commission. An important part of this report is the 'building blocks', which have provided a useful structure for the discussions and have contributed to the process of moving towards a consensus according to the established time frame. The result of this approach is an analysis and a clear picture of the positions of Member States in relation to policy content and financial implications. Considering the work done and results achieved under the Netherlands presidency, progress as scheduled should be within reach. We now pass the baton on to Luxembourg, which will continue the discussion in a spirit of mutual understanding directed at finding a consensus acceptable to every Member State. In this respect, let me also reiterate here that the important role of the European Parliament in reaching an agreement with the Council on the next multiannual financial framework is understood by all, and appropriate language will be included in the Council's conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council meeting the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 will be adopted. The strategy will be a key instrument to confront drug use and trafficking effectively with a view to ensuring a high level of health protection, wellbeing and social cohesion, as well as a high level of security for the general public. The strategy is based on a balanced approach towards supply and demand reduction. The Commission will be requested to present an action plan based on this strategy for 2005-2008 to the Council and the European Parliament as soon as possible. I look forward to close cooperation with Parliament in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will welcome the progress made under the Netherlands presidency in the field of immigration and integration. Common basic principles for immigrant integration policy within the European Union have been established. Moreover, the need for common basic principles on integration, clear goals and means of evaluation mechanisms, and greater coordination of national integration policies and EU initiatives in this field is also underlined in the Hague Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of external relations the European Council will discuss four issues. First, we will address the situation in Ukraine. I am glad that the parties concerned have reached an agreement on reform of the election laws and on a modification of the Constitution. We have seen that these changes have brought the Ukrainians a little closer to each other. We should now focus all our attention on the election process; because our goal remains free and fair elections, without external interference, where the Ukrainian people can be certain that the election results reflect their will. That is also the best way to guarantee the absence of violence and to maintain the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The second subject to be discussed is the Middle East peace process. Of course, in the short term attention will have to go primarily to the preparations for the Palestinian presidential elections. But we should also keep in mind the longer-term perspective. Therefore, we must ensure that the short-term actions fit into the framework of the road map, because both the Israelis and the Palestinians should return to the road map in order to be able to realise the long-term, final goal of a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European security strategy was adopted a year ago and the European Council will mark that. In the area of key threats and increasing the security in our common neighbourhood, the EU has achieved quite a lot. Examples include our efforts in the field of non-proliferation vis-à-vis Iran, and also the support package for Iraq that we were able to offer Prime Minister Allawi at the November European Council. Meanwhile, a number of challenges remain, for example the situation in Darfur. For the implementation of the security strategy, relations with the US remain of vital importance and therefore ministers will discuss how we can further strengthen our transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Council will also have a discussion with Kofi Annan, who will elaborate on a number of elements of the high-level panel's report. Government leaders will then have an exchange of views with him, especially about the threats and challenges of our time and the Millennium Development Goals, also in view of the major UN event in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will endorse a number of conclusions adopted by the ministers for development cooperation in November. In general the European Council will emphasise that the official development assistance of the European Community needs to contribute in a coherent way to poverty eradication in all developing countries. The European Council will also underline that the focus on the poorest should be increased, in particular in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will also discuss the UN high-level event in September 2005, when the world community will take stock of progress made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the main themes on the agenda of the European Council, other issues to be addressed are commonly shared values, consular cooperation, the EU Human Rights Agency and the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">On commonly shared values, the European Council will note with approval the series of public debates hosted by the Netherlands presidency, engaging participants with wide-ranging backgrounds and experience on the European identity and the concept of commonly shared values as the foundation of European integration and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On consular cooperation, the European Council will confirm the commitments of the European Union to intensify consular cooperation among Member States. Closer consular cooperation gives substance to the concept of European citizenship and helps Member States to deal more effectively with an ever-growing demand for consular services and to face new challenges, such as the consequences of an increasing number of terrorist activities, including bomb attacks and hostage-takings.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to enhancing the coherence and consistency of EU human rights policy, the European Council is expected to call for effective follow-up to the December 2003 decision to establish an EU Human Rights Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European External Action Service, the European Council will invite the Secretary-General/High Representative, together with the Commission, to prepare a progress report on this preparatory work and to take appropriate steps to keep the European Parliament informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands presidency has made it its duty to ensure smooth and efficient cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament to make it possible to deliver on the issues to be discussed at the European Council meeting. On 21 December Prime Minister Balkenende will brief you on the outcome of the meeting.</p>

It will be an important meeting, marking the next steps in the process of building a larger, more prosperous and safer European Union. It will be a sign of our ambition for a Union which is dynamic and on the move; a Union ready to share its destiny with the European family; a Union which is concerned about the security of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation. How else can we generate the trust in Europe’s institutions and politicians that is needed for a smooth ratification of the Constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard from the presidency about its expectations and the issues that the summit will address. Let me comment briefly on three issues: enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, our policy of enlargement of the Union has been the key in freeing us from our cold war past. The gravitational pull of the prospect of EU membership has transformed and modernised several post-communist societies. It has thus reshaped the European order. This was and remains an achievement of historic proportions that we should not underestimate. Your House has been instrumental in supporting this process, but our enlargement is still incomplete. This European Council will take the next steps for four countries, offering them the potential – through enlargement – to join the European mainstream.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October the Commission made it clear that it should be possible to conclude the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2004. Indeed, this negotiating process was closed yesterday, thanks to the increased efforts by the European Union and by these two countries. I congratulate the Netherlands presidency for its excellent work and close cooperation with the Commission on that particular subject. The Accession Treaty for both countries now needs to be finalised and we hope that it can be signed after receiving the assent of this House during the spring of next year. In the remaining period up to accession, the Commission will be watching closely to see that both countries deliver on the commitments made during the negotiations, and in some cases this will mean a further acceleration in their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the European Council, on 6 October the Commission adopted its report on Turkey and a clear recommendation. The main message in the Commission’s assessment is that Turkey has sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and that accession negotiations should now be opened. We consider this recommendation, which was very carefully prepared, to be well balanced and a good basis for a decision by the Council. I am looking forward to taking comfort from the position your House will take on this question later today.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks. It has adopted five of the six pieces of legislation signalled by the Commission in its report; the sixth law, on the execution of sentences, is pending before the Turkish Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time for the European Council to honour its commitment to Turkey and announce the opening of accession negotiations. A clear date should be indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that, apart from the matters I have just mentioned, no other conditions ought to be added. The European Council will no doubt wish to recall that political reforms will have to continue in the course of the negotiations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress closely.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also ask our Turkish friends in all honesty: if you want to become a member of a club, is it not normal that you recognise the other members of the club? I am convinced that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process, and preferably sooner than later.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of starting negotiations cannot be other than accession but we accept that the accession process is open-ended and its outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand. As in the past, transitional arrangements and certain specific safeguards may need to be considered. But let me state what our ultimate challenge will be: in the end, we need not only to overcome diplomatic obstacles, but also to conquer the hearts and minds of European citizens on this issue.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I should like to turn to one of the twenty-first century’s key challenges, and one which we will also discuss at this week’s Council summit, namely the threat of international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is the ugly face of globalisation. International terrorism exploits the advantages of pluralist societies to attack the very foundations of those societies – our freedoms. I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agreements on how terrorism can be fought.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show our unwavering determination, but we must never lose sight of the democratic and legal principles which are at the very basis of our society and our prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has played an active role in promoting and preparing an updated EU action plan on the fight against international terrorism, and I should like to make absolutely clear what we hope the outcome of the decisions to be taken at the end of the week will be. These decisions must help us to ensure that the EU will be better prepared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, as well as allowing us to block the sources of funding for terrorists to a greater extent than previously, improving our ability to manage the aftermath of an attack and, finally, ensuring better protection for our key infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force. We should also oppose its perverse logic, by tackling the ideological and social factors which lead individuals to commit such acts. Long-term commitment and a clear political determination will be necessary to overcome this scourge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> The discussions at the summit will also take stock of the situation regarding the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I still believe that the Commission’s proposals are sound, based as they are on a broad political consensus on what the EU must do. The truth is that the political project on which the Commission’s proposals are based was not actually at risk. The Commission’s proposals therefore constitute a valid working basis. The current ceiling for own resources remains in place despite new requests to the EU due to the enlargement and to the development of new policies. They are therefore reasonable proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want to offer, however, is actual added European value, on top of what is offered at national level. Of course, we must ensure discipline in the budgetary process, but this cannot be achieved by setting arbitrary limits, without reference to what the budget aims to achieve. I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1% of gross national revenue. I do not believe that the EU’s policy objectives are compatible with such a figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we prepared to abandon the challenges of social and economic cohesion, which are all the more pressing after enlargement? Are we really being serious as regards the policy of investing in the major trans-European transport networks? Are we really being serious as regards the need to foster the European research policy? How can we ensure a European contribution towards combating terrorism and towards safeguarding our citizens’ security? Let me state this to you clearly: we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ceases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">A 1% limit would force us to cut back on our political objectives and would force us to re-assess commitments already made. The Commission’s position is therefore clear: our starting point is the package submitted in February of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the Dutch Presidency’s very hard work, the negotiations have, thus far, yet to really begin. I sincerely hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will be able to drive this process forward and ensure that effective negotiations go ahead, because it is important that we respect the timetable established in the Council’s multiannual strategic programme. We must ensure that the programmes are fully up and running by 1 January 2007. This means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I can promise: as always, the Commission will not be the stumbling block to the outcome of negotiations. We shall help the Member States to reach agreements, but not at any price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pinheiro, João de Deus (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, as with all European Councils, the next one has some very interesting topics to discuss. I would go further and say that they are not just interesting; they are perhaps crucial to our Union’s collective future. Consequently, not only will the Heads of State or Government be taking part, but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission. At this time, we must ask for three indispensable qualities: ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at what this means with regard to each of those topics. Whilst the process of admitting Bulgaria and Romania appears to be going well and the result of genuine efforts on the part of the two countries, we are strongly aware, however, that Romania needs to sprint down the home straight. Whilst we too have no doubts about Croatia – you only need to have been to Zagreb or Dubrovnik to appreciate how embedded it is in European culture – Turkey is a special case, not only due to its geography, but also due to its peculiar cultural and economic characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Cyprus must not be swept under the carpet while we discuss negotiations. Nevertheless, the opening of negotiations will undoubtedly help to clarify for both sides many areas that are currently in doubt and it will eventually be possible to gauge more clearly what kind of Union would be preferable to both sides. After all, there are other types of union apart from marriage that could potentially be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, terrorism is certainly one of the Council’s most important portfolios and we must combat it globally and unstintingly. Rogue states that harbour international terrorism, with varying degrees of legality, must be sanctioned by the EU without delay. International cooperation at various levels – political, financial or operational – must also take place without delay. In this area, there must be no delay and no lack of resources. This brings me to the Financial Perspectives, a portfolio that, as far as we are concerned, will set the tone for Europe’s desire to deepen our Union. The resources must match the ambition. This is something that Jacques Delors said, and with good reason. It is not possible, moreover, to cheat the countries that recently joined our European Union, nor those looking hopefully to the EU as an engine to propel democracy and development forward in their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. To think that Europe, the new Europe, our Europe, can be built with the resources of the past is a fallacy and it is worth saying that if ambition and solidarity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the orientations and guidelines that are adopted, we should be ashamed of our current leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this brings me to external affairs. The Council services tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean Partnership and, I should add, probably the situation in Ukraine, Darfur, relations with China and Russia and even Transatlantic relations. What I am wondering is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few topics, with the desire for a joint, EU-level external service, what resources will we use to seek to influence the international scene? Will we continue to be a soft power, striving for multilateralism without being in any way active on the international scene? Or will we have at our disposal the resources – the appropriate resources – to finally stop being the political dwarf of the international scene?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by saying what I said at the beginning. It is crucial that we speak about the Lisbon Strategy, about combating drugs or AIDS, about the new neighbourhood policy and about sustainable development. If, however, we do not have the three elements of ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas, we will be speaking as though we were autistic.</p>

The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has frequently told us of his ‘blind dates’, which have attracted the particular interest of this House. This morning I have now heard from Mr Pinheiro that he prefers forms of cohabitation other than marriage. Interesting things are going on in Portugal. In this instance, Mr Pinheiro, we are no advocates of the common law marriage the EU is to enter into with Turkey. We wish relations between the EU and Turkey to be strong, resilient, and stable – in good Christian Democrat style.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause and laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also warn you against speaking of cultural differences, Mr Pinheiro. Zagreb may well look European, and so does Istanbul, but this is not the issue at stake; what is at stake, and this is a point I should like to repeat, is whether we are in a position to define what Mr Eurlings gave a precise description of in his report, namely that the European Union is a community of values – a political community of values – and that it is based on the Constitution with which we have endowed ourselves and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have enshrined in the Constitution. This community of values is open to everyone who shares these values, without any kind of cultural relativity, and this is a point I should like to reiterate once again. This is self-evident to our group, and, yesterday, we decided with what I think was almost 99% of votes within our group ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">in an open ballot, not a secret ballot, to give Mr Eurlings our support for his belief that, if this order of values can be enshrined in a Muslim society, it will be proof that this order of values is open to every person, of whatever religion, skin colour and cultural or ethnic background they may be. The reason why this is such an important issue, Mr Pinheiro, is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the preliminary debates. I believe that there is a direct connection between this issue and the question of whether we will manage to disprove the theory that the Islam of the most dangerous terrorists currently active, the Islamic fundamentalists, which they describe as the only Islam, and the order of values I referred to a moment ago are mutually exclusive. I believe that the mere opening of negotiations with Turkey, a step which also means that Turkey is prepared to submit to the Constitution and its rules, is evidence that the implementation of a secular social reality is not linked in any way to religion, but instead to the political will of a people. This is the crucial point, and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the debate on Turkey and the debate on the fight against terrorism are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">During yesterday’s preparations for today’s debate, we too discussed Romania and Bulgaria, and developments in both these countries. I will not deny that we regret that our friend, Mr Nastase, lost the presidential elections. It was a fair decision, and we should like to congratulate Mr Basescu. We only hope that Mr Basescu has a sufficient sense of responsibility, something which he did not demonstrate during the election campaign, not to enter into coalitions with parties in his country which are opposed to the European Union and which ride roughshod over our fundamental values. You may be sure, Mr Watson, that we will continue to observe Romania as closely as you have done to date, particularly with regard to the issue of whether the future Romanian President forms a coalition with the extreme right. This is something you can depend on, and something we will observe particularly closely.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause and heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the debate that is on the Council’s agenda ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">should consolidate what the European Union has achieved in its role as mediator in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council. On behalf of our group, I should like to say – and I also address these words to the Dutch Presidency – that the European Union has provided an enormous amount of support throughout what has been going on in Ukraine over recent weeks, which represents a fundamental shift in the internal political situation towards democracy, freedom and human rights. It was the EU that acted as mediator in the country, and I believe that the staunch support of all those concerned, including the Dutch Presidency, has made it possible to achieve progress which will result in a greater degree of democracy, and which has proven that a united European Union, combining its forces and deploying them jointly, can make a genuine contribution to international politics. For this we are grateful, and we would like to extend our renewed thanks to all those involved, including Mr Solana, Mr Kwaśniewski and also the Dutch Presidency. Mr Nicolaï, I would ask you to pass on our group’s thanks to the Council.</p>

A majority of the members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe believe that Turkey fulfils the political criteria and that you should open negotiations. It seems to us important that Europe should not define itself as a Christian club. And yet, by the same token, we must beware of an aggressive secularism, which could drive away many of those who belong in our community. I pay tribute to the work of Mr Eurlings in drawing up the report on Turkey for this House; a report which I think commands widespread support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, when it discusses Turkey, your Council will meet in secret. It is important that in this House, when we discuss and vote on Turkey, we do so openly and in public and not in secret.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also recommend to the Council that we have a discussion in our Union about the European Union's capacity to absorb new Member States, particularly countries beyond those which currently have candidate status. I recommend that we have a discussion on the nature of the European Union, because it is our vision of the European Union that will determine its borders, rather than our vision of countries wishing to join.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will also discuss Bulgaria and Romania. My Group has long believed that these two countries – and indeed others – should have separate accession treaties. Bulgaria closed all of its negotiating chapters earlier this year and has made good progress. In Romania, progress has been much less easy to see. For me, the election results this week give cause for hope. I believe that the concerns of many can now be set aside and that with resolve and goodwill, we can bring Romania into the European Union effectively in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Schulz)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I say to my friend Mr Schulz: for heaven's sake stop defending corrupt socialist regimes, whether in the Maldives, the Seychelles or in Romania. I thought Mr Basescu was actually a member of the Socialist International, but I may be wrong.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests from Mr Schulz)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You should not be defending regimes which are doing things that are not worthy of your party.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right and the centre)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we now have the chance to move ahead with Romania and we must do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, President-in-Office, I recommend that you hold open the door, but insist on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">High on your agenda, too, will be terrorism and I pay tribute to the work of the Council's anti-terrorism coordinator. You need promptly to put into practice measures that have been identified in the Hague Programme relevant to combating terrorism, in particular, measures relating to exchange of information between Member States. Efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Council must stress the importance of promoting respect based on universal values, tolerance, dialogue and democratic participation. Too often, our approach in this Union to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice has concentrated on security and justice at the expense of freedom. I hope that your presidency, Mr President-in-Office, will ensure that the balance is set right. We need to get our police forces and judiciary working together. We need to move the European Union from being simply an economic community into seeing itself as a community of values. But for that to have the support of our citizens, it means recognising the fundamental importance of the values outlined in our Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The appropriate financial framework will be discussed in a building aptly named after a Dutchman, Mr Justus Lipsius. My Group welcomes the methodical approach of your presidency to preparations for the Union's budget from 2007 to 2013, but we are not sure whether your building blocks are independent building blocks or a Rubik's Cube. Is any outcome possible other than the one per cent to which your country was a signatory in the letter to Mr Prodi? It seems to my Group that we need to give the European Union the resources it needs. It is better to spend 1.2 per cent well than to spend less than 1 per cent badly. While, as a Scot, I welcome the approach of my soulmates in the Netherlands to the financing of the Union, I believe that the Council must give the Union the resources it needs. You must also heed the report of the Court of Auditors and tackle the failure in our Member States to put adequate controls in place on the spending of European Union money.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Council will discuss ESDP. Operation 'Althea' is working successfully and three other ongoing missions are examples of solid progress. Let the Union's voice be heard in our neighbourhood policy and in our relations with China, the United States and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the headline of the forthcoming European Council may be Turkey – and we should expect no less for a pillar of European civilisation – beyond the headlines there is much important work to do in foreign and security policy.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our debate today is on culture, and on what is and what is not European culture. It is an issue on which I should like to make a few comments. I am always sceptical when anyone tells me that things are culturally incompatible, and this is perhaps due to family reasons. We are all aware of how often Jews have been persecuted for marrying non-Jews, and how often white people have been persecuted for marrying black people, and such persecution has always been carried out under the pretext of cultural incompatibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also astonished at the emotional fervour, or in some cases even political blindness, with which debates relating to Turkey are conducted. I am well aware that there are worthy people with worthy arguments who are opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU. It is entirely normal for worthy arguments to exist both for and against such an accession, and yet I am perplexed by the level of aggressiveness of those who are opposed to Turkey joining the EU. The basis for racism is always irrationality, and I cannot help but think that certain arguments against Turkey’s accession are not political, but purely cultural, or, in other words, racist. We cannot tolerate such a thing.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of an example are we setting to Turkey and to the world? Mr Poettering has told this House that this is the most important decision to be taken by the European Parliament and by Europe in recent years, and that, as it is so important, we should take the decision in utmost secrecy, so that everyone is left in the dark with regard to how we have reached our position on this important issue. This House is to hold a secret ballot.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Can you just be quiet? Afterwards, you may speak for three minutes, like Mr Schulz. I shall say what I wish to say, and you may say what you wish to say. You may speak after I have finished.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If Members of this House demand secrecy, it is because they do not want voters throughout Europe to know where we as individual Members stand on this key issue. It is a disgrace to democracy that the vote should be conducted in this way. It is a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You should give some consideration to what the people of Turkey will think. One can perfectly well be opposed to Turkey’s accession, but what will the men and women of Turkey think if they are told that this is an issue they are not allowed to know anything about? Do Europeans really want us to hold sittings in public and to provide public records of votes, as preached repeatedly and especially in Mr Poettering’s incessant sermons to the Council? This is something we wish to know, and this is something that is enshrined in the Constitution. This Parliament, a moral authority for good behaviour, has suddenly decided on the most incomprehensible and undemocratic course of action possible, and I find this impossible to understand.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one more remark on Romania. Cultural differences sometimes also exist between the EU and societies which will shortly be joining it, for example the pervasive corruption in Romania, something which is a simple fact. We therefore call on the Romanian Parliament to take us seriously. Romania should be accepted into the EU, but only after it has met the Copenhagen criteria. At present it does not yet meet them, which is a fact that must be stated, and we should not accept it until it does. Romania will be accepted ...</p>

Accession to the EU represents a major opportunity for Turkey, as there is still a need for the values it represents, such as the rule of law, democracy and human rights, to gain acceptance there. There is therefore an urgent need for the negotiations to be conducted transparently, and for the democratic changes necessary in Turkey to be spelled out.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true in the case of the violent clashes in the Kurdish regions, and I would call on the Kurds and the Turkish armed forces to reach a ceasefire and to seek a political solution. I am extremely concerned at the increase in human rights violations and homicides, for example the case of the 12-year-old Urud and his father, as well as the new proceedings which have been initiated with the aim of banning the Union of Education and Science Workers.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are to be accession negotiations, it would be up to Turkey to demonstrate, by means of a genuine implementation of its reform plans, that all Turkish citizens, regardless of their origin, are accorded the same rights, that there is equality of the sexes and that certain religions are no longer discriminated against in favour of others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial for the Ankara Government not only to adopt laws in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria, but also to implement them in practice. The 20 million Kurds in Turkey hope that, when accession negotiations are opened, their rights, too, will be secured, that they will be able to express their identity freely, that they will be acknowledged and that it will become possible for them to return to their villages. It is necessary for the village guard system to be abolished and for the 10% clause for elections to be reduced. Last weekend thousands of people demonstrated in Diyarbakir for the opening of accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a German MEP of Kurdish origin, I should like to join my group in calling for accession negotiations with Turkey to be opened, and we call on all Heads of Government to make known, on 17 December, their support for the opening of accession negotiations. The European Union should not fear Ankara, and Ankara should not fear Diyarbakir. Turkey can act as a bridge between the EU and Islamic countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This time I would like to look at the issue from a different angle, and to warn the Council against the decision it is going to take. It is my belief that this decision will have extremely serious consequences, not merely as a result of Turkey’s entry, but also in terms of the European Union’s image amongst the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the public is less and less sure of what we regard as our borders. If Turkey were allowed to join, the borders would be blurred, and the door would be open to a large number of Turkish-speaking countries, including the countries of the Caucasus such as Georgia. In short, we are currently slipping into a kind of world state, the foundation for which is merely a hazy catalogue of good intentions labelled ‘human rights’. This development is incomprehensible to many Europeans, all the more so because – and this is my second point – we are at the same time turning our back on what Europeans see as the essence of Europe, and what has been loosely, and perhaps clumsily, described as its Christian roots. In spite of everything, there is a very well-defined idea of the way of life and civilisations of which Europe is made up. We are moving ever further away from these, and we no doubt do not realise the extent to which we are insulting and shocking citizens, trapped as we are in the hustle and bustle of the globalised elite.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that the first consequences will not be long in coming. The forthcoming referendum has meant that the French people are beginning to see the link between Turkey and the Constitution, and they will vote accordingly. I would therefore like to remind the Council of their responsibility for the outcome of the decisions they take next Friday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is bound to create the kind of tensions and inflame the passions that we have seen not only here this morning, but also in our debate yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important issues that we have to look at as a Parliament and as a Union is: what message do we send if we refuse to open the door to negotiations with Turkey at the weekend? We set down certain rules and criteria which must be met by Turkey before negotiations can be allowed to begin. The Commission has laid out a very clear blueprint of how much has been achieved and what has yet to be done before we reach the final hurdle. But we have also demanded that Turkey should fulfil its responsibilities and duties. There is, for instance, the question of the recognition of Cyprus and the independence and integrity of Cyprus. Then there are certain human rights issues that were mentioned by Mr Coûteaux, the previous speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to hear a Kurd speaking about Turkey being part of the European Union. That is an important message that we should take acknowledge and follow. Our voice, our message, will determine whether or not the voice of moderate Muslims will be heard or whether we drive people back into a fundamentalist response and attitude. That is why, if we oppose Turkey coming into the European Union because we are fearful of its impact on our economies or its impact on the balance of power within the institutions, we should say so clearly. We should not try to hide behind some false pretence that it is going to change the way Europe operates forever.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union of today is a very different animal from its 1973 incarnation. Indeed, one of the things that is lacking in the European Union of today is the vision and inspiration of the founding fathers who made the phoenix of peace, prosperity and solidarity rise from the ashes. The responsibility of and onus on this generation to extend a hand to other countries is as great today as it was in the 1940s and 1950s. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, quite a few members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish to vote against the Eurlings report because they are squarely opposed to Turkey joining, but dare to do so only when the way they vote is concealed from the general public. For fear of possible criticism, though, and of all the consequences that this entails for their careers in their own countries, where their governments, haughtily laughing off popular opinion, want to give Ankara the go-ahead the day after tomorrow, they will not do so if the vote is public and not secret. The same may apply to quite a few Members of the Socialist Group. I would remind you of the valiant positions taken up in France on the Turkey issue by Robert Badinter, Hubert Védrine and the former Socialist Education Minister, Claude Allègre, all of whom have cautioned us about the disastrous consequences of Turkey’s possible accession. It is indicative of the lack of democratic openness with which this issue has been addressed for years now.</p>
<p class="contents">In Helsinki, only three minutes were taken to discuss the question as to whether Turkey should obtain candidate status. That is what is reported by the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr Bolkestein, who was the only person with the courage to tell Mr Prodi that he refused to approve the positive Commission recommendation of 6 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Three minutes to decide whether we move the hotbeds of conflict in the Caucasus and the Middle East to Europe’s boundaries. Three minutes to decide whether tomorrow, we will again offer millions of immigrants the opportunity to flood our continent. Three minutes to decide whether we allow a country, where human rights in general and women’s rights in particular are violated on a large scale, entry into our Union as a so-called model secular state and straight away give them the largest number of votes in the Council. Three minutes to give the go-ahead to a country that refuses to recognise another Member State and occupies part of that Member State with 30 000 troops after having committed untold crimes against humanity. Three minutes to give the go-ahead to a country where the state’s denial of the Armenian genocide is organised by the Ministry of Education, while nobody in Europe utters a word about this.

As rapporteur, I should like to say, as I have said before, that my visits there have left me in two minds. On the one hand, there is a great deal of progress, and impressive progress too; on the other, Turkey is still trailing behind quite a bit if we were to compare that country with a country that really wants to become a Member of the European Union. That is why reforms have to continue in the areas of human rights, women’s rights and religious freedom. I cannot emphasise enough that pressure in those areas must be simply unrelenting. Indeed, the Turkish media and Turkish journalists urge us to use the stick and carrot approach and keep up the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights have to be implemented more effectively. A switch in mentality is required in the area of religious minorities, so that people are proud of minority religions instead of trying to oppress them. In the field of, for example, the law on foundations, further legal amendments must be tabled in order to offer scope to minority religions and minority cultures. That is why, quite apart from the whole core discussion that has been going on for months in this House and elsewhere, I should like to press home the fact that it would be good if an important section of the report that is now before us for final vote were also to be included in the Council’s conclusions.

If we discuss political criteria, then I would like to say that if I compare Turkey to, for example, Romania, and I consider the poor treatment in prisons, the physical attacks on investigative journalists and corruption, I take the view that the Council should send out a message, and maximum pressure should be brought to bear in order to solve such matters. In my view, those practices are not in line with the political criteria which we uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark concerns terrorism. I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council has made this a key issue. I am also glad that the Netherlands – in the spirit of practising what you preach – will now finally start banning organisations that are on the European list of terrorists. I should like to ask the presidency to convey to the other Member States that we should stand united in this. Consequently, to name but one concrete example, ETA should be banned in all countries, and not only in Spain and France. Can the presidency guarantee now that with the exchange of information agreement, it will no longer be possible for one country to hold information about attacks in another country, without this information being automatically exchanged? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that my fellow Members are wrong in thinking that a secret ballot may favour a shift away from that position; on the contrary, I expect that Members in this Chamber will demonstrate that they are not subject to any pressures when freely carrying out their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the remainder of the foreign reports, I agree with much of what Mr Nicolaï said and I should like to express our agreement on all the measures that bring forward constitutional reforms. In the High Representative’s actions in Ukraine we have glimpsed a sign that the initiative in that direction is being strengthened. The initiative should, however, be supported by more substantial instruments, which are foreseen in the Constitution but which might perhaps be brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the neighbourhood policy, we encourage the Commission and the Council in their work. We point out the danger, however, that the measures to create a free-trade area may take precedence over the other policies. I would stress that we do not just want to create a free-trade area, and so we should be careful not to weaken the policy’s regional and subregional dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards human rights and democracy, I recommend that we negotiate a proper convention with our neighbouring countries. Such a convention should at last spell out the shared values that we so often refer to and define them carefully in formal terms, particularly for the sake of the Mediterranean countries. The convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Middle East, we must ensure that the presidential elections in Palestine give the road map a new boost and that the Israeli Government’s unilateral decisions, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, are included in the negotiations with the Quartet, so that the creation of the Palestinian state can be completed within the established time frame. To that end, this issue will have to be placed at the heart of the relationship between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Iraq, we consider that the hoped-for turnaround has failed to materialise even after the Sharm el-Sheikh conference and that the aim of holding elections may well be jeopardised by the violent situation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Council and the Commission to devote attention also to the situation in Cambodia, where there is a humanitarian emergency concerning children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place, I should like to assess the efforts it has made towards reducing regulation at European level. The aim was to end the Brussels bureaucracy and to cut the number of regulations it produced by at least 25%. Needless to say, we are far from reaching that percentage, but the tone has been set, and I regard that as a great bonus in itself. After all, if there are fewer rules and regulations, there is more room for entrepreneurship, because it is the entrepreneurs who have to save the European economy. I still think it desirable, though, to appoint a European Commissioner to focus solely on the elimination of superfluous and obsolete rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A second topic addressed during the Dutch Presidency was the so-called Hague decisions about terrorism and combating crime. The agreements reached in The Hague illustrate that the European Union and the Council too – at long last – consider the fight against terrorism and crime as one of their priorities. At the same time, a balance has been struck between an effective approach and extra legal scope on the one hand and the protection of personal data and fundamental freedoms on the other. After all, we are still being put through our paces on that score, and I think that the Council has done a reasonably good job.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic of human rights has not received a great deal of attention, but sound work has been done on it. I would particularly mention the protection of the defenders of human rights. Under the Dutch Presidency, the practical implementation of the EU directives concerning human rights defenders has moved one step closer. A manual will be compiled for the EU delegations across the world; it will provide for a prompt, flexible and consistent reaction from the EU when human rights defenders are in peril of death or are at risk of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Nicolaï on the inclusion in the agenda of the need for good communication about European integration. The public still considers Europe to be far removed from their own personal lives and are far too ready to turn their backs on it. It is only by frequent communication and a constant dialogue with the citizen, not only by the Members of this House, but also by the members of the Commission and the Council, that this gap can be bridged.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the debate about standards and values with which this presidency started. As a Liberal, I feel hesitant about such a debate, in general, and about the purely Christian nature that the Christian Democrats tend to lend it, in particular. I also find it objectionable that the Left have devalued the terms ‘standards’ and ‘values’. It is important that this debate should have made a start; after all, it is a debate about what Europe is, where it should be heading, where our boundaries are and what we are doing, or not, as the case may be. In short, it is a debate about where our foundations lie. Money is not, indeed, the EU’s only <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. I think that Mr Balkenende’s article in <span class="italic">de</span> <span class="italic">Volkskrant</span> of 7 December was excellent; one of his conclusions was that the Union is about dynamic values. I see these as including respect, responsibility and confidence. We have in any event made a start on the discussion and although the end is not in sight by a long way, this is still worth a compliment for this presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, the presidency has definitely brought the European Union closer to the Dutch people and even to members of the Dutch parliament. This, I know, is Mr Nicolaï’s crusade, and it has proved very successful; as a Dutch MEP, I too am pleased with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the summit, I hope that you will really take the time to discuss at length the kind of Europe that you have in mind, before you pass this subject back to the specialist ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States want a smaller budget than the present one, which is just above 1%. The Council prescribes that no cuts must be made in the agricultural budget, and it seems unlikely that any agreement will be reached on cuts in the structural funds. Where do you think cuts will be made? They will be made in research and development, human rights, the environment, external affairs, youth exchanges and culture – precisely those areas which are close to people’s hearts and which visibly add value at European level. A budget that is born of euroscepticism will only breed more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to terrorism, the draft conclusions of the forthcoming summit state that we, in our efforts to fight terrorism, must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. While agreeing with those conditions, I fear that this may be no more than an incantation. I would refer to the discussion about storing communications data of all telephone and Internet users or the biometric data on passports. The motto is: strict, stricter, strictest. It seems almost inappropriate to ask critical questions about the effectiveness or the legitimacy of measures against terrorism. Like all army generals, those fighting terrorism in Europe always want the top gear. At least in defence purchases, politicians always independently weigh up costs and benefits. Where measures to fight terrorism are concerned, though, almost nobody dares make this critical assessment. Nonetheless, I would invite you to do just that at the forthcoming summit, because at this rate, we will mess up our rule of law, and terrorists will have their way after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a brief comment about transparency. The Dutch Presidency has pledged to try to emphasise the implementation of the clause in the Constitution on the basis of which the Member States will have public meetings henceforth – after all, they were all agreed on this when the Constitution was signed – or at least hold more of them in public. I should like to ask Mr Nicolaï what he has achieved on that score. I hope that during the Luxembourg Presidency, the doors of the Council of Ministers will be truly open. We will then be able to see in all openness what is going on, and it will be possible for ministers to be held responsible for the decisions taken, as we today are keen to be held responsible for the decision we are taking on Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement, with the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey, requires decisions, the consequences of which will be decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clarify from the outset that we are not against Turkey's European prospects. We expect such prospects to bind any country pursuing such prospects within a minimum framework of obligations pertaining to basic issues which apply to the other Member States, such as fundamental freedoms, civil rights and workers' rights, without of course harbouring any illusions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these obligations must be laid down from the outset and be accepted by Turkey. How could it ever be possible for a candidate country to be allowed not to recognise the existence of another Member State and for this issue not to be clearly laid down at the summit? How will this question be answered if there is real equality between the Member States or if, ultimately, there are two sets of standards and two yardsticks?</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in my opinion, a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>not only for there to be mutual recognition but also for there to be normalisation of relations between Cyprus and Turkey, not only because the European Union and the principles which govern its operation so command, but also because the Cyprus problem needs to be resolved in order for right to prevail for the benefit of our people, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. No nation in the world wants the illegal occupation of and hatred and partition in their country and this cannot be perpetuated. The European Union must open a window for the safeguarding of the basic principles of its very existence and call for the application of this minimum framework of obligations and must also open a window for the simple citizens by showing that it does not take decisions using two sets of standards and two yardsticks.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I wish to condemn the arrogant conduct of the Turkish leadership and its government when, in the statements it makes, the impression is given that it is the European Union which is asking for Turkey to join and not Turkey which is asking to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the subject of Ukraine, after the way in which he pushed through the election of his criminals and Commissioners, let us stop pretending that we can in any way lecture Ukraine on democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey, we will not be supporting its membership application, just as we did not in the last Parliament, on the grounds of both cost and likely migration patterns. Had anybody in authority been here, I would have asked for confirmation that the cost could be in the order of GBP 19 billion or EUR 28 million. This means that Turkey is costing us as much as the ten countries that acceded to this Union this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Could we please know what the cost will be, because for the first time you are hearing from a nation that is actually paying for it. Although the Labour Party in Britain wants to put GBP 5 billion towards it, the Conservative Party believes that GBP 5 billion is a good price to pay and believes you can still have tax cuts. Presumably it also thinks that pigs can fly. Can we actually have confirmation of the cost of 19 billion? Also, will some EUR 700 million be spent on around 60 diverse training projects in Turkey? Is that the true cost, or is there a more up-to-date figure?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that Turkey's population growth rate remains phenomenal and that it has serious economic problems, including 70 per cent inflation. Seventy per cent inflation during the passage of the Maastricht Treaty would have caused some raising of eyebrows, but it is just a political project here, is it not? Especially for those who do not pay. We also know that human rights concerns are widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis I would say, on behalf of the UK Independence Party, that we will offer Turkey friendship and free trade, but we will not offer the country political union – especially with the corruption and fraud that are endemic in this place.</p>

<p class="contents">We have often said that Bulgaria and Romania ought to join the Union, though we are particularly concerned about the areas in which there is still a wide gap between the current situation in those two countries and the European average. In that respect we would point to their legislation on human rights, social protection for workers and economic development, which should reach significant levels by the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Although in principle we are in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey – which, I stress, is a very different thing from accession – we must not forget the need for its acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide and for a lasting solution to the Cyprus question. To somebody with any common sense, it is incomprehensible that a country that aspires to join the Union should be militarily occupying part of another country that is already a member.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not at all worried about the voting system that we should use. I believe in the freedom of all Members to make their own decisions, regardless of whether the vote is open or in secret. I think this is just a formality and certainly not a question of any substance.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over. I believe, however, that the Union should maintain an ever stronger presence through its policies and aid in those parts of the world that surround it and in which there are ongoing, sometimes tragic situations of conflict. By doing so it can exert a stabilising influence to support those sections of society that accept the values which characterise our democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barroso, who has already left, said that the December Council would be a great step towards the building of a more prosperous Europe. Judging from Mr Nicolaï’s comments, however, it is more likely to be a small and timid step, not a great one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not the only one who feels that the Council is working without any kind of serious vision and without any long-term strategy, that it lurches from one event to another, and that it merely reacts to problems without any long-term plan of how it should act to avoid them. This lack of strategy is a fundamental error, and it gives rise to a great many problems. Much is now being said by the Council on the subject of Ukraine, and many of its comments are entirely relevant. Yet if the Council had stated clearly a few months ago, as part of its future strategy, that Ukraine would join the European Union, not today, not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow, but maybe at the same time as Turkey, then the current situation in Ukraine would not have arisen, as the Ukrainian Government would not have been able to afford to rig the elections to such an extent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I should like to thank the absent Mr Barroso for, namely that he was in favour of a larger budget for the European Union.

There are very strongly held views on this issue across this Parliament and beyond. I acknowledge that. However, the policy of my party is clear: we believe that in the right circumstances Turkish membership of the Union could be good for Europe, good for Turkey and good for relations with the Islamic world and security in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that the negotiations with Turkey are likely to be lengthy and at times difficult, but this week the Council should take a first step in that process. Like any other applicant country, Turkey must satisfy all the criteria required in terms of human rights and economic and political reform. This might be very difficult, but by agreeing to the formal opening of negotiations the Council will send a clear message to the Turkish Government that we expect it to work assiduously to achieve the steps necessary for eventual membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Bulgarian and Romanian membership of the Union will also feature on the agenda and the objective there must be to affirm the accession of both countries whilst recognising that a great amount of work remains to be done – in particular in the case of Romania – to ensure they remain on track.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of economic reform in the Union was discussed at the last Council in November. However, I hope that the Netherlands presidency and the heads of government will reaffirm their commitment to kick-starting the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this week the Socialist Group expressed concern at the neo-liberal nature of the new Commission. I want to make it clear that we expect Mr Barroso and his team to be true to their earlier statements on the need to reinvigorate the economy in Europe and the crack-down on red tape and regulation. The outdated social model so beloved of the left is to be replaced with a vigorous, dynamic and radical reform programme. This is the only way to deal with the high unemployment and sluggish growth that has led to Europe lagging behind the United States and the burgeoning economies of China and India.

<p class="contents">I would like to point out once again that the financial perspectives are an instrument of budgetary discipline and not an accounting instrument, an instrument that fundamentally serves to provide stability and allows for reasonable medium-term planning of the Union’s policies. This instrument is so important that it appears as a law in the future Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission yesterday and its President, Mr Barroso, today, have confirmed that they fully accept the proposal of their predecessor. Mr Barroso said a moment ago that the Commission’s proposal is a starting point for negotiations of the financial perspectives. Nevertheless, I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective energetically. In that way, that starting point could also become a finishing point and the Commission would thereby respond to that expression that we mention so often: we cannot create more Europe with fewer resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and Parliament must also fulfil their respective responsibilities and face up to the challenges confronting us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, economic and social cohesion is not just a principle enshrined in the Treaties and enhanced in the future Constitution, but also a necessary condition for maintaining and protecting the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the enlargement we have just carried out, we must not spare any effort when it comes to the new citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, five years ago we set some very ambitious objectives. We are at the halfway point and we are very far from achieving, by 2010, a competitive knowledge-based society with full employment, as we proposed in Lisbon and Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we are in the middle of the process of ratifying the European Constitution and the citizens sometimes show even more enthusiasm than their representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these challenges, we cannot be miserly towards our citizens. We would be making a great mistake if we were to try to incorporate them into this project we call European integration – and everything it represents – while at the same time reducing the Union’s resources. We must continue to build a Europe with the necessary resources, with the resources laid down in the Treaty, and use them efficiently. That would undoubtedly be the best guarantee we can offer future generations of a future of peace, freedom and prosperity.</p>

These factors must have affected your ambitions and efforts when it came to security and combating terrorism. Action plans and programmes are fine, but little has happened so far. If the European Council can make progress at the Summit, all well and good. It must not be forgotten that security and the fight against terrorism must never push aside protection of individual privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have debated most of the issues on the agenda together in this House. You were here on Monday evening and listened to the debate on Turkey. In a few hours’ time, we are to vote on Mr Eurlings’ report. I believe that a solid majority of MEPs will vote in favour of giving Turkey a date. In that connection, I wish to say how deplorable it is that certain people in this House have pushed through a policy that makes the final vote secret. This Parliament is always at the forefront of openness and transparency, and the politician who does not dare to look his or her electorate in the eye on this issue has no place in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we expect you to have the courage to take this historic decision and, notwithstanding all the difficulties, to give Turkey a starting date with a view to its obtaining full membership. Only in that way can the democratic process continue. This will also give a clear signal to the tens of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakir who, at the weekend, demonstrated in favour of EU membership for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the European security policy, together with disarmament. I assume that you will be discussing the agreement concluded by Iran with three of the Member States. It is, of course, extremely positive that Teheran intends to suspend its extraction of uranium. There are still, however, considerable doubts about what really lies behind this decision. We should be very vigilant before making any concessions to the Iranian regime, which must prove that it is serious and that it is not only, as so often, playing a strategic game. The mullahs in Teheran govern with an iron hand a country in which human rights are completely neglected. There is no reason for rewarding such a country until we see practical improvements in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Democratic Government in my country maintains – although it may be mistaken, as it often is – that the issue of the embargo on arms sales to China will come up on Friday. If that is the case, I would remind you of the solid opposition in this House to lifting the embargo. This would send out completely the wrong signals to the Chinese regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After listening to certain Members of this House over the past weeks, one could be forgiven for thinking that the European Union took consistent steps to establish, support and guide the democracy movement in Ukraine. It would be a fine thing if this had been the case, yet in actual fact it appeared on occasion as though the EU’s high representatives were almost afraid of so much movement and so much lively and animated democracy, even during the mass demonstrations. I believe that lessons must be learnt from these experiences in Ukraine, and not only by the Members of this House, but also by the diplomats of the European Union and of the nation states.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s security is also dependent on the situation in its neighbouring countries. This is something I have heard very frequently in recent weeks, yet it is not only our security and our well-being that is always at stake. If we are serious about the European values that we often invoke, the authoritarian and dictatorial systems around us must not be tolerated or accepted, regardless of our own interests. At a time of so many changes for the better in Ukraine, which we may have helped a little towards the end, even though we did far too little, we must be aware how problematic is the situation of the Belarussian people and their freedom, and we must also discuss Russia. It must not be said that President Putin and Russia are the same thing, as Russia has the ‘Memorial’ movement and a very strong freedom movement, and this is something that must influence our diplomatic relations with Russia and our policy towards it.</p>

This sector has already shed more than 1 million jobs in the last ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the debate we requested on this extremely important issue has not taken place here in this House. It is crucial not only that we announce possible measures to prevent companies from closing and millions of workers from losing their jobs, and to dispel the threat of poverty and social exclusion that hangs over large areas in which these companies are heavily concentrated, as is the case in Portugal; it is also crucial that such measures be implemented. Hence the question that I ask once again: how will the impact of abolishing the quota system in those countries with the greatest concentration of the textiles and clothing industry be taken into account so that unemployment is prevented from getting any worse and so that this extremely important industry is defended? I ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that this question reaches the President of the Commission, who did not deign to hear our question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Common citizenship and votes according to population figures will destroy the EU and give rise to dominance by the big powers. I want to see a Europe in which large and populous nations are able to operate better in conjunction with small countries. I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put its name to a communications strategy that will take money from opponents of the Constitution and make it available for propaganda on the part of adherents of the Constitution. That is in conflict with the principle of equality and is thus illegal. It is scandalous. The money used for propaganda is there for the purpose of selling an undemocratic Constitution to the electorate. It would be easier to ensure that the democracy we are losing in the Member States were at least combined in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Constitution makes it incredibly difficult to amend the contents of laws. Any change to one of the numerous policies locked into the Constitution must first be proposed by unelectable Commissioners in Brussels and then be based upon a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers or, if appropriate, a unanimous amendment to the Constitution. That is not democracy. The undemocratic Constitution is, then, to be sold through an undemocratic distribution of funds for the purpose of providing information, so that people do not manage to discover that, crucially, they are losing what is at the very heart of democracy: the right to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and, subsequently, a new policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether the solution to the democratic deficit is a federal bicameral system or, alternatively, our vision of a Europe of democracies is something that people should discuss and should decide in free and fair referendums in all the Member States. We rightly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elections. Should that not also apply to ourselves? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barroso, you in particular have spoken a great deal about it before this House. It has to be said, however, that a European identity must be built first and foremost on common security and on the common economic area. There can be no question of a European identity if solidarity is lacking, and this lack manifests itself every time financial decisions are taken. I would remind you that you referred to Parliament’s key role in the drawing up of financial perspectives. I wonder what will become of financial solidarity and the foundation for the building of a European identity if Parliament’s proposal is cut from EUR 111 billion to EUR 106 billion? If we wish to build a European identity in the shape of a common area of security or a common economic area, we must be clear where the boundaries lie for EU enlargement. Given that Turkey’s accession has been proposed, and that someone might well shortly propose the accession of Morocco, whilst overlooking Ukraine, it is likely to become impossible to speak of a European identity, as there will be no such identity.</p>

I should, however, like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council that our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements, and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europe’s borders lie. We are of course in favour of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU, although these countries still need assisting in their efforts, and we are also in favour of Croatia’s accession, as it will send a strong signal to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the situation is entirely different with regard to Turkey, a country which does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30 years. Turkey punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide, and 97% of its territory is outside Europe, which means that it has no right to join the European Union. This is why we hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France. Turkey’s integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway, before it has even come into being, and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure. Would this be a sensible course of action?</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to another, equally important, issue, I welcomed Mr Barroso’s hard-hitting remarks on the EU’s Financial Perspective. Nevertheless, I remain concerned with regard to Europe’s future. Without the necessary resources, the EU cannot seek to strengthen social cohesion or to support competitiveness, employment, research and environmental policy, and it will also be unable to give due consideration to the ageing of the population – in other words to adhere to the Lisbon strategy – or to continue the fight against terrorism, drugs and crime. If we continue to operate with outmoded budgets, we will be unable to confront the challenges which await us, for example the explosive growth in Chinese competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should therefore abandon its calls for a European budget set at 1%, as otherwise Europe will no longer be able to guarantee the funding of its regional policy, which is close to the hearts of EU citizens. We expect the Council to take into account the priorities I mentioned previously, and then to allocate the resources necessary to achieve our goals. We should not forget that Europe cannot be built without the contribution of every individual and every European citizen. Europe should export its values to the rest of the world, but it should also respect the men and women who enable it to exist. Unfortunately, I fear that the decisions taken on 17 December will be incomprehensible to many of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to encourage you, when dealing with Croatia, to take a tough stance where cooperation with the International Criminal Court is concerned, because without that cooperation, it is irresponsible to make a serious start with Croatia. Persevere! With regard to Romania, can you guarantee that we keep the requirements for that country strict? That is to say: no accession as long as Romania does not meet the criteria in the areas of human rights and corruption, among others, even if that means that Romania joins the EU after Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to Turkey. Would I be quoting the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Balkenende, correctly if I said: no second-class status, such as a privileged partnership, and no end date? Is that still your position now? Are you also prepared to say: no membership at the end of the negotiations if the human rights violations persist? Will you apply zero tolerance? Incidentally, with regard to the secret ballot which we are threatening to hold today about Turkey, I am left with a feeling that this would be to deceive the public. I hope we will not need to resort to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, you have held a debate about standards and values. Should you not have made this concrete by applying it, for example, to an issue such as Romania or Turkey, in the spirit of the French philosopher who said: <span class="italic">cherchez la vérité dans la situation</span>? Why not?<span class="italic"> </span>Otherwise, it will remain a little theoretical. Does the arms embargo against China not fit perfectly in the framework of the debate about standards and values? This is not about Islam or Christianity, but about the communality of rule of law and democracy, and in this great diversity, it is about the values we have enshrined in our new Constitution. I hope that that will remain the common denominator in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said to you before that my impression so far of the Dutch Presidency is that its ambitions and goals are not as clear as they need to be. My question is whether that is a sign of insecurity or internal political contradictions within the Dutch Government, or are we still waiting for the big revelation? In that respect, the Council has quietly saddled us with very thorny issues on a few occasions. I will for a moment forget this meeting place, Strasbourg, but I would refer to the inefficient Treaty of Nice and the agreements surrounding agricultural spending which were too expensive and produced too little change.</p>
<p class="contents">Your ambitions concerning Lisbon, Kyoto in Europe and the world are wonderful and we support you in them, but the financial resources you are setting aside for them are pitiful. This contradiction will, of course, not escape the public. Terrorism is once again the subject of lively debates at very high level. Only last week, all European chiefs of police were gathered here, telling us that, due to diverse national practices, the factual exchange of information is still not getting off the ground as it should. There is still no person in charge at the heart of Europol, terrorists are still slipping through the net of the law and there is no harmonisation in the area of criminal investigation. The question remains: is Gijs de Vries to keep coasting along, or will you allow him to do his job properly?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish you much success with your position on Turkey. The line I would take would be: no second-class status and no alternatives; we are ready for real negotiations. I hope that with this, together with Mr Balkenende, you will provide Mr Poettering’s group with an adequate response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this purpose, certain conditions must without fail be met, one of the most important of which is the recognition of Turkey's internal plurality. Breaking the fundamental Kemalist taboo is of vital importance. Recognising the linguistic, cultural and political rights of Kurdistan and other stateless national communities is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically we Europeans want Turkey to comply with all of that, but we wonder whether we should not start by recognising our own intrinsic plurality. What about all the pluri-national states that keep denying their own diversity? In the particular case of Spain – a state that in theory acknowledges its own domestic plurality, but not always equality among all the different nations that make up that state – still more steps have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Government, Mr Miguel Angel Moratinos, presented a memorandum on 13 December on the official languages of the autonomous communities. Such a proposal does not imply, as we wanted, full recognition status for Catalan, Basque and Galician. It does not give any recognition to Asturian or Aragonese. This memorandum offers the chance of speaking in the European Parliament in Catalan, but always at 15 days' notice. How can I handle this if I do not know until the day before if I am to be given the chance to speak?</p>
<p class="contents">When your Member States' governments sincerely acknowledge their plurality, that will be the most powerful tool in working towards a more democratic Turkey, and in asking for a fundamental change to the way in which it is applying to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A great many legislative changes have occurred in Turkey, but it has to be realised that these are not matched by the reality on the ground and by changes in practice. Current Turkish legislation too is very deficient. I can point to the new criminal law that still in practice makes it a criminal offence to mention the Armenian genocide in Turkey. That is completely unacceptable, and to Turkey’s discredit that it continues to deny this historical fact. Recognition of the genocide would open the way to normalisation for the Armenians in Turkey and also to the normalisation of relations with Armenia – something that is necessary if Turkey is to become a member of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secret ballots are generally only held in this House on matters relating to Members, and it is entirely incomprehensible that such a ballot should be held on important political decisions on matters of principle. Who wants to hide, and from whom? Are they hiding from the people of the Member States, the majority of whom – on the basis of rational argument – are opposed to Turkey’s accession, or from the chairmen of their groups, out of fear of standing up for their convictions, whatever those convictions may be? This would mean that this House is merely imitating the Council’s behaviour, and ultimately we will fall hostage to those who say that it is too late to say no. It is by no means too late to do so. If Turkey were to join the EU, Europe would fall into chaos. This can be prevented if we are open and transparent in casting our ‘no’ votes today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was, of course, not the easiest of times to lead Europe, but we had no choice. It already had a late start, following the recess; then there was the handicap of a newly-elected Parliament that was starting to find its feet, and that was followed by the Commission which came about in fits and starts. Under this not terribly lucky star, the Netherlands still tried to set to work. That is why I think that the Netherlands should count its blessings, because despite the short period of time, an awful lot got done, for example, with regard to the Hague Programme for internal security, the security of our citizens. In that respect, Minister Donner, who is so often under fire in the Netherlands, has, together with his colleagues, done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Eurlings has already said a few things about Turkey; I do not propose to repeat them. Something I do have difficulty with and which I think merits a comment is the <span class="italic">de facto</span> acceptance of Romania and Bulgaria acceding. I think that we need to let the Council, the summit, know that the matter, particularly in relation to Romania, is certainly not done and dusted, because in that country, human rights, women’s rights and children’s rights are still being violated and corruption is still rampant. In any event, all things being equal, I do not think it is all that certain that Parliament will say ‘yes’ to it. With the same thing in mind, I should also like to make a remark about Croatia. It appears that there is much more reserve with regard to that country, and I would like to ask the Dutch Presidency whether that attitude would not stifle any initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the Lisbon agenda, the ambitions of which should, of course, be measured against the funding that is being set aside for this purpose. In my view, at the summit, the 1% club should in any event ensure that the requirements for Lisbon and the question as to how social cohesion can be best achieved with the ten new Member States are examined more effectively. Ambitions and funding should tally with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is imperative for the European Union’s anti-terrorist policy to allow cooperation to be stepped up effectively between Member States and with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we believe that Member States should enter into the necessary commitments with a view to implementing the action plan on the fight against terrorism, while sticking to the timetable for that action plan, and also enter into commitments with a view to eliminating the obstacles which certain national administrations are placing in the way of exchanges of information. We must also allow Europol and Eurojust to provide European added value in the fight against terrorism by placing them at the centre of cooperation and exchanges of information between Member States. We would however note that the fight against terrorism should maintain a balance between necessary security measures, on the one hand, and respect for fundamental rights, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">A political agreement on the EU’s anti-drugs strategy has already been reached within the Council, and merely needs to be adopted officially at the Council summit on 16-17 December. I believe it to be unacceptable that the Council has once again failed to wait for the European Parliament’s opinion, and that it refused to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of progress made in its own negotiations when the parliamentary committee was discussing the very same issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we hope that a fairer approach will be adopted to issues of asylum and immigration, above all in order to ensure that the rights of every individual are respected and that responsibilities are shared. Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that the Hague programme made no provision for measures to be taken in instances where Member States do not transpose legislation or instruments relating to justice and home affairs. This is one of the shortcomings of the most recent multiannual programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have here the final draft of the conclusions and I must say that you have done a very good job.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, I wish to start by highlighting positively the paragraphs of the conclusions relating to the imminent accession of Romania and Bulgaria and to emphasise that the accession of these two countries is creating a new geopolitical reality. Consequently, I consider it very important – as you mention in the conclusions – that the relevant agreements and treaties be signed early on in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the case of Turkey, a great deal has of course been said. I, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, will insist on keeping paragraph 20 of the draft conclusions which I have before me, because it deals with the question of the peaceful resolution of differences with neighbouring countries. I would ask you to examine very seriously the inclusion of a paragraph on Cyprus, by which I mean the withdrawal of the Turkish forces and, of course, recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a couple of positive remarks on what you have to say about the financial perspectives. It is very important that we resolve the problem of the financial perspectives because, as you say, the financial perspectives and how they are addressed will give an enlarged Europe the tool to deal with future challenges, and I welcome the fact that you are talking of the need for prudence.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism, but I wish to draw the Presidency's attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraphs. It is a complicated issue, a very serious issue. It is here to stay, we shall face new challenges every time and the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission will therefore need to cooperate closely in order to combat this phenomenon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It started for me with a letter bomb exploding in my office. Since then we have had the Madrid bombings. I would hope that at this time of the year our thoughts are with the victims and their families. Outside the European Union there was the tragedy of Beslan, and then today's bus siege in Greece. All this reinforces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolute priority for the EU but, as a number of colleagues have already pointed out, that needs real action. Far too often cooperation among our police, judicial and intelligence services is cooperation in name only. Even a short conversation with anybody who works for Europol would reinforce that. Member States have to deliver on their promises. We need action, not words.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the economic agenda. Member States have to be called to account by the presidency for the things they have promised to do. In particular, we have to get much more investment into people. We particularly need to deliver on the active labour market policies that Mr Wim Kok has reported on in the past. Too many people in the European Union are inactive. We are far too prepared to pay people to be on the scrap heap. We need much more proactive policies to make work pay, and that includes more childcare and more education and training. We cannot simply write people off as being unemployable.</p>
<p class="contents">Sound finances are the basis of a good economy and therefore we are right to review the budget. As my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said, it must not be some sort of mathematical exercise. We have to look at what we do. What is the added value in doing something at European level? What is the best way of getting value for money for our citizens? At the same time, we always have to remember that solidarity is the cornerstone of the European Union. You remove that cornerstone and you undermine the very foundations of the Union. That is why this debate on finances is vital to the future of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of Croatia, we have a well-prepared nation and country with European traditions working toward admission to the European Union. As Croatians lived under the same form of government as Hungarians for over 800 years, 400 years of which as part of the Habsburg Monarchy, their commitment to the legal system, and their social and economic organisation is very similar to those of Hungary. I went to Zagreb several times in the 1990s, I have also visited it lately, and concluded that based on their institutional preparation on the levels of government, economy and parliament, their hopes for negotiations are as justified as Hungary’s were at the beginning of negotiations in 1998. Croatia’s economic and social preparedness also makes it possible for the negotiations for accession not only to be opened in the spring of 2005, but also to be concluded, regardless of other factors and other countries, such as Turkey. This may also serve as a positive message to other nations and governments of the West Balkans who are headed towards Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania’s accession will be a major step in the evolution of Europe, as a European nation composed of various European peoples, including two million Hungarians, will join. It will be a win-win situation for both foreign policy and the internal market. Being accepted by Europe will hopefully help Romanians not only to discover the advantages of their diversity but also to preserve them, contrary to their current policies. The preservation of European solidarity also includes paying attention to the impact that the expansion has on those Member States that comprise the borders of the European Union, such as Austria was this year. A monitoring system operating on a more regular basis, that is biannually, needs to be established to ensure that commitments are followed through. In the case of Romania, the functioning of the community system is of key importance, and in order to prove this, it is enough to consider environmental protection, the policy of competition or areas made vulnerable by internal considerations such as animal health, customs, or excise tax. If screening, that involves the European Parliament, reveals deficits in these fields a few years before and after accession, then EU resources must be mobilised for the necessary institutional development even at the cost of other goals. Should this fail as well, then – let us face it – specific sanctions will have to be applied. As Bulgaria (which has shown promising progress) and Romania should be subject to individual consideration, I believe it is necessary to separate their accession processes and if necessary, to stipulate a flexible accession date to Romania, whose membership I very much look forward to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although it is a fact that every rapporteur treats the country for which he is responsible a little like his or her own child, I do believe that this is not merely a matter of taking a decision on Croatia, but of taking a decision on a whole region. Particularly given the stability and security concerns that have already been touched upon, it is vital that the Council’s decision on it should be favourable. This would be a sign that every country in the Balkans, if it makes the appropriate efforts and meets the criteria, has a chance of becoming a Member State of the European Union, something that was recently promised in Thessaloniki. I believe that both the former and the present Croatian Governments, with their differing political orientations, have done a great deal to prepare themselves and to move towards meeting the criteria to which we must pay close attention in every instance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is however an obstacle that is undoubtedly of great significance, namely cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. It is claimed that there is such cooperation, but it has been neither full nor adequate. Demands have been made, and rightly so, that close attention be paid to whether every country – both Croatia and the other countries, above all Serbia – cooperates with The Hague in this respect. Yet I believe that in principle, and as a matter of priority, the Council should acknowledge the positive steps undertaken by Croatia, and that this should also be reflected in the Council’s decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the Government will not merely issue declarations, but will genuinely take every possible measure to bring the indicted general Ante Gotovina before the Tribunal in The Hague. In addition to taking such measures, it should also destroy the networks that perhaps still exist and support him, and it should ensure that they are genuinely destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that Ante Gotovina, if he is the patriot he claims to be, should not take his country hostage. He must give himself up to the Tribunal in The Hague, as it would be a real shame if the fate of a country as important as Croatia were to depend on the decision of a single man not to surrender to justice. I therefore hope that, in view of all these circumstances, a positive sign will be given to The Hague. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Public opinion has not concerned itself to such an extent with any other candidacy. There were no such differences between the Member States or between the political parties, no such pressure was brought to bear by the United States, no such concerns or fears were expressed, no such variety of questions was raised so seriously at every discussion table. The European Parliament is having trouble finding its political direction on this issue, not because of any weakness on its part, but because of the complexity and seriousness of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Arguments have been expressed for and against the accession of Turkey to saturation point over recent days. We have one common denominator: we are calling on the European Council to defend the dignity of the European Union; to respect Turkey, but also to respect the values which unite the peoples of Europe. No <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> can be used as an alibi for setting aside our values or for adjusting them to Turkish demands, be it in connection with the spirit or the letter of the Copenhagen criteria or with the recognition of all 25 Member States of the European Union, by which you will understand that I mean the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. This is not only a moral choice, but also the best basis for a sustainable policy which will safeguard our cohesion and will inspire respect for and confidence in the Union in its citizens who, in all events, expect clear justification for the decisions of the European Council and a public dialogue which, unfortunately, has not yet taken place, with substance and depth on the future of euro-Turkish relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue I wanted to mention is that the Council should, at long last, draw up a long-term plan for our foreign relations with decisiveness, cohesion, properly coordinated objectives and reliable financing. In particular, I want to refer to our relations with the countries of the Balkans and our partner Mediterranean countries which make up our living space. This framework includes the role which we need to play in the resolution of the Middle East crisis, in this new era which is at long last now starting for the region; it would appear that the goal posts are shifting and that there are margins for intervention and change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They did so in the belief that after many lost decades Hungarian society could become a part of the common European social model, including strong social policies for everybody, real improvements in environmental matters, free movement of labour and solidarity for common standards among the 25 nations. That is the goal of this huge European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides a permanent and almost endless enlargement, we should not forget the original idea of deepening the existing Union by the approximation and harmonisation of our standards of living, infrastructure and labour market. If we are deeply concerned about the ageing population and the lack of labour forces, why do some Member States close their labour market even to the skilled workers of other EU Member States? The new financial framework does not seem to answer some of the basic questions – at least as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Is 1.24 per cent of the GNI of our Member States enough to establish a common social model for us? Is it enough to cover the expenses of the brave environmental initiative Natura 2000, designed to save our nature and biodiversity? If we are so proud of our cultural values, as has been mentioned in this debate, why do we spend only one per cent of our budget on culture, education, etc.? If 1.24 per cent of GNI is such a low amount to build up a common European social, environmental and cultural model, why are some Member States even considering reducing this amount?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, does the Council believe in a strong social and cultural union and is it ready to provide the basic financial sources to create it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate on how large the EU’s income should be should never conceal the importance of how we prioritise our expenditure. We must give greater priority to the expenditure supporting the development of the new knowledge-based society and dare to provide smaller subsidies to those parts of our economy that are too large and that belong to the economy of a different era.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process will of course be the most important element. What the Commission and the Council must do is not just talk about lofty goals but also propose practical measures that increase competition, especially within those sectors associated with the knowledge-based society. What is at issue is how we are to extend competition within the fields not only of education and health care but also of other areas of our society so that, in Europe, we might obtain the best businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue that makes the summit we are now facing especially historic, and that is the issue of Turkey. A ‘no’ decision, or a means of delaying the membership process, would of course have consequences of various kinds. We should in that case be leaving the field free for forces and ideals other than those for which the EU stands. The EU’s basic task is to create safety and security and to bridge differences instead of creating new lines of demarcation.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must ask ourselves the question: will we enjoy greater safety and security with Turkey rooted firmly in the fundamental values of the EU and of Europe, just as we are that much safer and more secure as a result of the enlargement that has taken place this year and just as we shall also be safer and more secure if the EU can be extended to the Balkans? That issue is ultimately about the respect we perceive for the work done by the EU. The reason why other countries want to join the EU is the EU’s success in increasing safety and security. This is an important reason why the Council must take the historic decision to agree to commencing negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been witnesses to an unprecedented historical enlargement with ten new countries. I myself come from one of the new countries and I think we can all agree that, after just the first seven months, we can say that enlargement has been a success. It has been a success for Europe, for the ‘old Member States’ and for the new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of the historic enlargement of Europe is not complete, however. We have talked in this House and we shall talk again this afternoon about Romania and about Bulgaria. I am convinced that both Bulgaria and Romania are well on the way to joining the European Union and I believe that, with the European Union’s help, they will be able to make a successful accession into our Community in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also going to talk about Croatia. Croatia definitely plays a key role in the Western Balkans. I should like the Council to give a clear signal to Croatia that accession talks should begin with that country, provided, of course, that the appropriate Copenhagen criteria and the requirements of the International Criminal Court in The Hague have been met. Croatia can, I believe, play a significant role in the Western Balkans and could be a future model for Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia and the other countries of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">We spoke here yesterday, and we shall again today, about Turkey. I should like the Council to remember its obligations, to remember Europe’s promises and to begin accession negotiations with Turkey. Given that we have awarded that country the status of candidate country, I feel that we owe it to Turkey to open negotiations. This will also support the process of reform there, which has been pursued successfully for the last two years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They were elected to represent, in a European context, the interests of their people, and thus of their nation states. They are only the first among equals, no more than that, and they bear a tremendous responsibility for our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">One would normally assume that these very Heads of State or Government represent the will of the people, but, right now, that clearly seems not to be the case where existential questions are concerned. Let us take my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, as an example. There has been a new survey on the issue of Turkey. Only 15% of Germans are in favour of Turkey gaining full membership of the European Union , 60% of Germans support that special form of cooperation that we call a privileged partnership, 22% are generally against cooperation between Turkey and the European Union and only 3% expressed no opinion. In spite of this, what our Chancellor put to the Council was his own party-political opinion. He is the strongest supporter of Turkey’s accession, of this great madness. Is that right? Is it responsible? No, it is not. We see exactly the same situation in other Member States. The Council must be aware that the decision now to be taken regarding the start of accession negotiations with Turkey is not just about the further enlargement of the EU. It is an existential question for the European Union, for the political Union which is of the utmost importance for us and for the preservation of peace in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, our history reflects the history of Europe, and shows how difficult it is to get along with all these small, headstrong European nations. History also shows us that if we expand too much now, as did so many other former empires which grew too fast, there is the danger of our overreaching ourselves and bringing about our own downfall and ruination. If our own Heads of State or Government now give Turkey a starting date for negotiations, even though the criteria have not been met, and even though we know that we cannot manage to integrate this enormous country, they will be gambling away our future. However harsh this might sound, Turkey is too big, too heterogeneous, too poor, and too populous. We must not take that step. We have expanded much in the past year and three more countries are yet to join us. We have to consolidate our position first. We have to get to grips with each other and it is the example of German reunification that shows us how difficult that task is. We have not managed it yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to our Heads of State or Government to be aware that they represent the will of the people, that they have to convey the will of the people to the outside world, and that the majority of the people of Europe, I am quite convinced, think: ‘Please be careful in making promises to Turkey. We cannot afford it!’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone presents surveys that serve their purpose. I know of surveys carried out in Germany which show that people have nothing against Turkey becoming a member of the EU. I can only say that I would warn people against over-dramatising and exaggerating the situation, as you have just done. It is completely mistaken and inappropriate to tie Europe’s existence and the survival of the European Union to Turkey’s accession. Let ten years pass and wait until the negotiations are over, and maybe then Turkey will become the thirtieth member of a great Union with 500 million inhabitants. So please let us remain calm; let us keep a cool head and let there be less drama and emotion in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too actually wanted to talk about an enlarged Europe. I wanted to congratulate you on holding a series of conferences on European identity. That was a very good and necessary thing to do. We have to ask ourselves what it is that holds 450 million Europeans together, what it is that unites us all, from Estonia to Portugal, from Scotland to Greece, and, as we all know, the answer is: European values. It is also the positive objectives the European Union has set itself: the commitment to peace, to freedom and to justice. These are the things that unite us in Europe. Over the next two years in particular, during the process of ratifying the Constitution, it is especially important to convey these things and not to lose ourselves in points of detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore especially glad that, at the summit on Friday, under Points 66 and 67 of the Conclusions, you asked the Commission to put these matters at the forefront of its communication strategy. I think that we can win the people over in this way – Commissioner Wallström is also doing good work in this regard – and so I would like to encourage you to decide in favour of this, as it is indeed necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I also think that Points 69 and 52, in which we affirm human rights, are very positive. As it has already been agreed that there should be a European Human Rights Agency, it must now be set up. Europe needs this instrument, and our values are important not only for our identity within the Union, but also for our authority in the world at large. I therefore wish not only to congratulate you, but also to encourage you to push forward with these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate all the Members of this House, myself included, on the wide-ranging nature of the debate, and to express the hope that every other important decision will be preceded by a debate of such calibre.</p>
<p class="contents">During this debate, no fewer than four model positions on Turkey’s accession to the European Union emerged. The first is the traditional position, namely that negotiations should be opened, in all likelihood as early as next year, with the possibility of suspending them if it became apparent that problems or obstacles were being created by the Turkish side. The second position is that of opening negotiations with the possibility of offering Turkey an alternative solution if such difficulties arose during these negotiations, namely a special, privileged partnership. The third position consists of waiting until Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria in full, which amounts to imposing additional conditions given that the Copenhagen criteria have not been fully met. Finally, the fourth position is that of a special, privileged partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that Parliament’s decision is to adopt the first model, or in other words to start negotiations next year without any other additional conditions, and I also understand that this is likely to be the Council’s decision too. It will be a decision of ground-breaking importance, and a decision imposing a great responsibility on the Member States, the EU and the Council. It will mean taking the first steps along a very demanding path. Conditions are set not only for the Turkish side, but also for the Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. These conditions are all the more challenging, and this responsibility is all the more difficult to bear, because we are, so to speak, dealing with a child. References have already been made to a marriage, but I prefer to use the example of a family with an adopted child. In a certain sense, Turkey is an adopted child, and we should not forget that the responsibilities of the family and of the parents are particularly challenging when adopting a child. I hope we are all fully aware of this, and that we will begin to put our European house in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Dutch Presidency’s evaluation of the action programme of June 2004 is proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this is a threat to all of us, the most appropriate strategy is one that leads us to act together, bypassing national level and even the areas of internal justice and security. Indeed, the way to deal with terrorism today is entirely different from the 1970s and 80s. The events of 11 September 2001 have ushered in a radical change in the area of security. European countries have new responsibilities and new challenges, the urgency and seriousness of which was confirmed by 11 March.</p>
<p class="contents">In a globalised world, politics, diplomacy, internal security and defence must be combined to address these new types of threat. Security has become a global, indivisible concept, which today encompasses internal and external security and the support of third countries in the fight against terrorism. The EU and its Member States must streamline their defence capacities and strengthen their channels of diplomatic cooperation, their information services and their legal and law enforcement coordination, in a genuine synergy of national and transnational policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Portuguese Member of this House, I wish to point out that my government – under the then Prime Minister, Mr Durão Barroso, who is now President of the Commission – transposed all Community legislation in the area of combating terrorism and took the operational measures needed to carry this out. On the same subject, I should like to highlight the introduction of biometric data in passports, a measure that was only recently adopted by Parliament. Provided it is accompanied by essential precautions, this measure will serve to strengthen crime prevention and, in turn, to reinforce the citizens’ security, which is our primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the European Council, the various speeches made in this House on this subject have shown that Parliament wishes to send out a clear message that this is the path that together we must relentlessly continue to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the same, it is important to treat each candidate country separately according to progress made, not as a package.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the principle that every EU enlargement must be balanced by a strengthening of our internal dynamics and unity is important. As my colleague Mr Pinheiro said, ‘Turkey is a special case in the enlargement’. The opening of negotiations may be sanctioned provided all the Copenhagen criteria are clearly met, just as in the case of accession countries in the final round of negotiations. This is not yet the case. A fundamental question for governments, however, is the inconceivability of opening negotiations with a candidate whose military forces occupy the territory of an EU Member State, and which does not even recognise the existence of that state. This position must be made unequivocally clear before the negotiations start. This is fundamental and cannot just be recommendatory; otherwise, the present ambiguity regarding the criteria will create a precedent whereby such accommodations in regard to large candidate countries may begin to repeat themselves. This, however, will undermine the sense of security of other, smaller countries in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call on the Commission to consider Ukraine’s prospects for the future, because it is in Ukraine that the question of the EU’s eastern border is being decided today. Yesterday a representative of the Ukrainian people was here – the Ukrainian Eurovision Song Contest winner Ruslana, who probably has a greater number of supporters than any Ukrainian politician. Her message was this: ‘Show me the room in this building where we could hand in Ukraine’s accession application’. Today there is no such room, but for those of us who support the democratic rebirth of Ukraine, it is our business to heed this message and to make sure that this room is found and made ready for use in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a good thing that this House should devote a lot of time to the issue of Turkey’s readiness to join the European Union. That is what the public expects of this Parliament. However, the people at home also expect us to base our debate and our decisions on a serious analysis of the facts, and it is in this regard that I have some doubts. What has been said here today about Turkey’s accession has little to do with the reality in that country. The Dutch Presidency has expressly stated in the introduction that Turkey has fulfilled the political accession criteria, and thus is a democratic state under the rule of law, where basic rights, and especially the rights of minorities, are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission has obviously read the most recent Commission Progress Report more closely. He speaks instead about the fact that Turkey <span class="italic">sufficiently</span> meets the political criteria. This apparently means, among other things, that torture is no longer systematically used in Turkish prisons, and that women can hope to one day have the same rights as men in Turkish society. It seems that a lot of my fellow-Members in this House are basing their opinions on this principle of hope – particularly all those who are to the left of centre and who, I suspect, will be in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, Mr Cohn-Bendit, and others, have told us that a Turkey that is secular and respects the rule of law would strengthen Europe’s community of values. That is true. A secular Turkey which respects the rule of law would indeed strengthen Europe’s community of values. The Turkey of today, though, is still a long way from these values. If we do not admit this to ourselves, we are not only being dishonest with the public, but are also endangering the stability and security that has hitherto been achieved in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not proceed further down the road of automatic acceptance of accession, or at least not where and when the facts do not really justify it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I am grateful for the remarks made by many and of which I have taken good note in preparation for the European Council that is due to be held on Thursday and Friday. Let me start with the fundamental debate raised by a number of Members of this House, that being the debate about what the European Union is, what Europe is. I am very much at one with a number of Members, of whom Mr Watson was the first and most outspoken, who state that the European Union is not a religious community. I am also in agreement with Mr Cohn-Bendit, who pointed out that Europe is not a cultural community either. As Mr Schulz and others stated, Europe, the European Union, is a community of values. European integration is a political project rather than a religious one. In that connection, Mrs Uca made the helpful remark that, with Turkey in mind, that conclusion can also be a bridge to Islam and indeed, we can use it to illustrate that Europe is a political and not a religious project. Conversely, Turkey can use it to demonstrate that a country that is Islamic for the most part can also be a democratic and functioning constitutional state.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you, including Mr Maaten and Mr Lehne, have spoken in explicit terms and with appreciation about the series of conferences on the nature of Europe and the essence of the values we share. One of the important lessons that we can draw from the discussion about European values and European identity is that we must, in fact, be careful about focusing on European identity. We all know, from the past century, what the adverse effects can be of an identity that has been imposed from above. We also realise that in terms of shared European values, many of those are, in fact, universal values, and we want them to be exactly that. Despite this, there are discernable European traits with regard to the way in which we apply those values, how we can invoke them and how we organise them. There are definitely specific European accents that are evident in those values, one important example being tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the enlargement debate, which attracted many speakers, starting with the debate about Turkey. We held that debate yesterday and concluded that, because of the concerns about it, we will, in time, need to clearly demonstrate the huge advantages of the possibility of Turkey joining. Mr Schulz mentioned security as one of the advantages. Mr Watson noted that Turkey sufficiently meets the criteria, and that is also, in agreement with the Commission’s conclusion, the presidency’s position following the entry into force of the six laws. Mr Eurlings and others pointed out once again that it is important to maintain pressure on Turkey in relation to the developments needed in that country in respect of human rights, religious freedom and other political criteria. That is precisely why the presidency has decided, based on the Commission proposals, to come up with a new framework for future negotiations about accession. That framework allows for more pressure to be brought to bear and offers more guarantees for smooth progress. This so-called ‘emergency stop option’, in other words an option of suspension, offers guarantees in relation to the sensitive political criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that a number of Members of this House should, once again, have raised the issue of Cyprus. Mr Barroso included it in his introduction, and Mr Adamou and Mr Dimitrakopoulos alluded to it too. I should like to reiterate the Dutch Presidency’s key position on this score in the preparations of the Council that will be held at the end of this week. We do indeed want Turkey to recognise the fact that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and is one of the Twenty-Five countries. We want to bring this about by getting Turkey to sign the protocol to the association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Berg has asked specifically whether the presidency can confirm that the intention is that no accession date be set. I can confirm very emphatically that that is indeed the presidency’s intention. Another question, related to the political criteria, was whether the presidency can confirm that Turkey will not join unless it is ready. Here too, I can definitely confirm that to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally in connection with Turkey, I should like to raise the sensitive issue which will be discussed presently in Parliament, namely the so-called open-endedness of the negotiations. Once again, Mr van den Berg asked specifically what the presidency’s intention is. Let me make it clear once more: the presidency’s intention is that these should be accession negotiations with accession in mind. That is my first point. My second is that, following on from the Commission’s comments, it is an open-ended process. There is no guarantee as to the outcome. The third element is that European cohesion must in any event remain sufficiently guaranteed, but the Dutch Presidency’s understanding for Thursday’s and Friday’s conclusions is that there is indeed no Plan B.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we will be discussing Romania and Bulgaria later on, I will now confine myself to a few fundamental remarks in response to questions in this respect. Mr Watson and Mr Becsey, among others, have insisted on a separate approach for Bulgaria on the one hand and Romania on the other. In that connection, it is useful to point out that, as you know, no distinction can be drawn in the agreement, but one can, if necessary, be drawn with regard to the date of accession, because the option has been introduced and agreed, if there is cause for this, to decide to suspend accession of the country in question for one year at most. That is also the response to the questions by Mr Eurlings, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Kirkhope, who are still deeply concerned about the situation in Romania and emphasise the importance of continuing to bring maximum pressure to bear on the developments there. I share that view, and that is why we in the Presidency have proposed that the Council should conclude that we want additional provisions in terms of monitoring and specific benchmarks for Romania, coupled with a potential sanction, if necessary, of one year’s suspension.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have made reference to Croatia, and, as it is not a separate item on the agenda, I think that, despite the uproar in the Chamber, it would be useful to give you a precise response to this. Mr Pinheiro and Mr Becsey have indicated that Croatia has made much progress in moving closer to Europe, and that it is a European country. I should like to emphatically endorse both of these statements. Much progress has been made and the country is located in the centre of Europe. In addition, Mr Watson, Mr van den Berg and Mr Swoboda were right to point out that full cooperation with the ICTY (International Criminal Tribune for the Former Yugoslavia) is of vital importance. I would say to Mr Swoboda and to Mr Becsey that it would, of course, be good if we could make that positive step, also bearing in mind the fulfilment of Croatia’s role as a model in the Balkans. I agree with Mr Swoboda that we must try to have a positive decision. That is the presidency’s commitment and that means that indeed, we can decide in favour of opening negotiations at the beginning of next year, provided that these are specifically linked to full cooperation with the ICTY.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point that many of you have raised is that of combating terrorism, the major significance of which has also been underlined by President Barroso and Mr Pinheiro, among others. In addition, Mr Watson, Mrs Malmström and Mrs Buitenweg were right, in my view, to point out the importance of striking a balance between fighting terrorism and fundamental rights. I agree with them, and I think that Mr Maarten was right to point out that we, in the Hague Programme, have demonstrated the Council’s desire to preserve that balance. Mr Eurlings specifically asked about ways of banning organisations. He will be aware that that is a responsibility, a competence, of the Member States, but we will definitely ensure that information about it is exchanged between them. Mr Eurlings, and others, see the exchange of information as crucial to the fight against terrorism. That is the cornerstone of this presidency, and is also included in the Council’s agenda for Thursday and Friday. Over these past six months, we have made concrete progress in making it easier to exchange criminal records, collating intelligence and in relation to situation centres and threat analyses that can be carried out in those centres. As you know, we will be asking the Commission to table a more detailed proposal for the exchange of information, as provided for in the Hague Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of a number of Members, I am happy to inform you specifically of the European Council’s intention, next Thursday and Friday, to decide whether, in principle, to appoint a European human rights ambassador.</p>
<p class="contents">Many in this House spoke about the financial perspective. In his introductory remarks, Mr Barroso mentioned the importance of added value where the multi-annual budget and budget discipline are concerned, and he had good reason to do so, but he also expressed his concern, which was subsequently given greater emphasis by others, about the 1% approach and the importance of sufficient funding for Europe’s priorities. It is therefore useful to indicate the Council’s position on this score. We subscribe to many of the priorities mentioned here, but it remains important in every financial discussion, in addition to the priorities, to determine the posteriorities, and not only count the priorities. That is exactly what we in the Presidency have done with what we call our ‘building blocks’ approach, in which we have tried to draft a summary and compile posteriorities rather than only priorities. I can reassure a number of Members who are worried about what is going to happen on Thursday and Friday. Mrs Grossetête feared that we would be taking a decision about 1% which would not be understood by the citizens. The Council has not adopted a position on the 1%, let that be very clear. Based on the Commission proposals, which are still the guiding principle – because, after all, the new Parliament quite rightly values them greatly – the Council has simply outlined the positions of the Member States, both priorities and posteriorities, and it is on those that we will be basing our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to concur with Mr Watson in his concerns about the financial accountability and his concern about the fact that, for the tenth time now, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about expenditure. During our presidency, we have taken steps to improve that situation by means of single audits, and we will discuss this in more detail in the spring.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EU’s external policy is concerned, I think we have experienced a historic moment, one that was mentioned by many. Mr Schulz was the first one to speak about it, and was very frank, as was Mrs Napoletano. That moment had to do with Ukraine. I think that the stance that we – the European Parliament, the Commission and Council – have taken has demonstrated our ability to speak with one voice where external policy is concerned. In my view, that is a very important step in the progress we managed to bring about in the democratisation process in Ukraine. It is also a very important step toward speaking with one voice in external policy. That is a first step and we intend to take more of them on the basis of the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I can be brief about the next subject, namely the Lisbon strategy, which was raised by a number of Members, including Mr Maaten, Mr Kirkhope and Mr Titley. You know that this subject is not on this Council’s agenda, as it will be raised in the spring. However, we will persevere, and it is true that the implementation of the Lisbon strategy is one of the key components. As Mr Maaten and Mr Kirkhope stated, it is also true that deregulation and the reduction of the administrative burden is crucial for our competitiveness in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn, finally, to the issue of public involvement and the importance of transparency and openness. What I should like to say to Mrs Buitenweg with regard to openness is that we have, during our presidency, tried to create more openness in the Council meetings wherever possible. In addition, a unique meeting took place in Amsterdam involving all European Affairs ministers. The whole of this meeting was public, as was an informal industrial meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end on an optimistic note. Mr Maaten congratulated the presidency on promoting the public’s involvement by means of good communication. I am not certain whether it has anything to do with that, but according to the latest Eurobarometer survey, there is an increase in the public’s positive involvement. The percentage of citizens who say that EU membership is a good thing has risen from 48% to 56%. That is not enough, but is nevertheless a big step forward and I should like to end on this happy note.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to thank you for your attention.</p>

The debate has also reflected the EU’s ambitious and demanding agenda over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only one single thing to add to what has already been said by President Barroso and the Presidency of the Council. This has to do with an aspect of the Commission’s proposal concerning Turkey. Parallel to the negotiations on which the Commission wishes to embark with Turkey, a cultural dialogue is also proposed. This will serve as a channel for the anxiety and prejudices that are to be found, as well as for the real differences that exist between the EU and Turkey, and will ensure that we can overcome all these by embarking upon a bilateral dialogue in civil society too.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something I believe is very important if we are also to investigate and resolve a number of the arguments put forward in this House. These often have to do with a fear of what is viewed as unknown or frightening. Remember that such fear is felt on both sides. I believe this to be an important instrument in the dialogue. The concerns in question are of course of ten years’ duration when it comes to the issue of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to ask ourselves some fundamental questions in the run-up to this important decision. What is it that can bring about the strongest forces in favour of a secular Turkey characterised by legal certainty? What would be the risks and the effects of signalling a change to the EU’s political direction when it comes to embarking upon negotiations with Turkey? I hope, indeed am convinced, that the debate that has been conducted in this House today will be a sound basis for the discussions that are to be conducted by the Council and that will continue to be conducted in the Commission too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
