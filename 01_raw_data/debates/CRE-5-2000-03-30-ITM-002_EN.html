<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gomes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the letter sent by this House to the Council and from the hearing of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs regarding data protection in the European Union, you have today invited the Council and Commission to comment on the possible existence of the Echelon system. This system is suspected of intercepting telecommunications beyond the bounds of any legal framework of justice and home affairs activities. I must thank you for having invited the Council to speak on this issue. This gives us the opportunity not only to clarify our position but also to inform you about all the measures taken by the Council on the lawful interception of telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must respect the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and which result from the common constitutional traditions of the Member States on general principles of Community law. The Council will do everything to safeguard these principles, particularly with regard to the right of every person to respect for their private and family life, their home or their correspondence, in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights which forms the cornerstone of our political work. It is common knowledge that work is in progress, in which this House is fully involved, and whose aim is to produce a Charter of Fundamental Rights which must apply within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Council presidency wants to firmly state its position on the possible existence of a system for intercepting telecommunications in the European Union, beyond the bounds of any legal framework. The Council cannot accept the creation or existence of such a system which does not respect the laws of the Member States and which violates the fundamental principles aimed at protecting human dignity. I must stress this very firmly.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the presidency considers that everything must be done to create an area of freedom, security and justice at European level. Our aim is to build a more open and secure Europe founded on an attachment to our common fundamental values. In this respect, it will sometimes be necessary to allow telecommunications to be intercepted when strictly essential to protect these values and in the interests of justice. This interception, which must be in proportion and have clearly defined limits, must pursue specific aims such as combating organised crime. When exercising this right which is fully enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, the presidency considers that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights must also be respected to ensure that the right balance is achieved between interference in private life and the public interest. In certain clearly specified and truly exceptional cases, the interception of telecommunications may be justified under these conditions. We want to act on this point with total transparency so that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of the progress of work within the Council on the lawful interception of telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also some other areas which we want to tackle. These were listed in the letter, which I have mentioned, as set out by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, and they were also contained in the letter, which your President has just sent to the Council. These areas are police cooperation, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Europol, Schengen and the initial discussions currently in progress on data protection within the Third Pillar. The Committee raised these matters and I have been asked to comment on them in the letter from your President.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of police cooperation, the Council adopted a resolution on 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications. This resolution, published in the Official Journal, contains a list of specifications for the Member States authorising them to lawfully intercept telecommunications with regard to network operators and service providers. This list allows each Member State to adapt its own national legislation so as to identify and overcome the difficulties in introducing technical specifications for interception in modern telecommunications systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 1995, a code of conduct containing this same list of specifications indicated in the resolution was established between the Fifteen and Norway. The governments of the United States of America, Canada and Australia informed the Council that they would not sign this code of conduct but that they would follow an identical policy. In 1999, the Council submitted an initiative on the lawful interception of telecommunications with regard to new technologies for assessment. Immediately after the start of this work, the Council consulted the European Parliament on this proposal on which this House issued an opinion in May 1999. The Council is continuing the work on this issue but has not yet adopted a final position. In its meeting on 28 May 1998, the Council adopted conclusions on encryption and law enforcement to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of digital communications which present considerable advantages for electronic commerce and the private lives of individuals and which can also help to prevent fraud and other crimes. However, we are aware of the concerns about the negative aspects, which the proliferation of encryption services for confidentiality purposes may have in the fight against certain forms of crime. This is why it was decided to closely monitor the degree of use of encryption technologies, particularly by and for organised crime. These measures must be proportional and carefully balanced with regard to other important interests, particularly bearing in mind the need to protect the fundamental rights specified in the European Convention on Human Rights and the operation of the internal market, with the aim of ensuring the development of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, particular attention should be paid to the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the Member States. Over four years of negotiations on this draft convention are nearly complete. The Justice and Home Affairs Council, in its meeting on 27 March, examined the most important remaining questions, including those on the interception of telecommunications. I am very pleased to announce that a full political agreement on measures for interception was achieved at this meeting. We therefore hope that the adoption of the act establishing the convention will take place during the Justice and Home Affairs Council in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures have also been specified on data protection in the Europol Convention. It must be stressed that Europol does not have powers of investigation and does not carry out work of an operational nature. Rather, Europol’s mission is to analyse the data supplied by the Member States or third parties. It cannot gather this data directly. I will clarify this for you. It is the responsibility of each Member State to send data to Europol. Therefore, any supervision of data protection is carried out in the Member State of origin with full respect for the Council of Europe Convention of January 1981 and the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe of September 1987. In this way the general rules on the protection of data sent to Europol by the Member States are respected. The convention therefore states that the latter must answer the question of whether the data has been properly gathered in the Member States. So it is the responsibility of each Member State to correct, delete or amend data sent to Europol where it becomes apparent that this data is incorrect or infringes the rules established in this respect. It must be stressed that Europol cannot, on its own, determine if the data sent by a Member State has been properly gathered. Each national supervisory authority has an essential role to play in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also speak briefly about the data protection rules within the Schengen Information System. This system provides for an authority responsible for protecting personal data. This common supervisory authority is composed of the supervisory authorities of the various Member States and ensures respect for the system’s principles on data protection, particularly those on the content of the data obtained and the use of this data. Full protection of the interests of individuals is therefore ensured in accordance with the instruments ratified by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must mention data protection within the Third Pillar. The Member States and the Commission are examining this issue in order to determine to what extent data protection should be provided in a horizontal perspective for the whole of the Third Pillar. Various aspects of this debate are being carefully considered, such as, for example, the questions of whether a common supervisory authority for all the instruments of the Third Pillar should be created or whether it would be sensible to create a common secretariat for these authorities. Furthermore, the Portuguese presidency intends to submit in due course, for the Council’s consideration, initial ideas on the possibility of developing general principles on data protection, which would apply to all the instruments of the Third Pillar. These ideas are still being developed. However, I can tell you that the Portuguese presidency, with full respect for the Community mechanisms, will duly inform the European Parliament about future developments in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">This, briefly, is the Council’s position on the work in progress or already concluded in the area of the lawful interception of telecommunications. To conclude, I must say that we fully understand the political concerns underlying this Parliament initiative. The presidency wishes to stress that it is ready to closely monitor Parliament’s work in this area as it considers that there is every reason not to compromise when principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms of individuals are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, the Commission has taken note of the recent debate with concern.</p>
<p class="contents">We received a letter by Madame Fontaine to Mr Prodi yesterday asking the Commission to focus its statement on certain questions. I will try to cover most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for human rights and the rule of law constitute the foundations of the European Union. The European Convention on Human Rights recognises the right to privacy as one of those rights. All Member States of the European Union are signatories of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific competencies attributed to the Community are defined in the Treaty. The Commission can only act within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaty. The Community has a clear competence in the field of data protection and in research and technological development. The Union has competencies under the so-called Third Pillar Framework with regard to law enforcement and the fight against crime. National security questions belong to the exclusive competence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Summit last week set out ambitious targets to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Exploiting the full potential of information technology and the Internet are key elements in achieving this goal. Electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life of European citizens. A well-functioning electronic communications infrastructure has become crucial for our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">A pre-condition for achieving the Lisbon targets is that citizens and enterprises can trust in electronic communications. A key tool to secure the confidentiality of electronic communications is encryption or cryptography. Encryption means the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a decryption key. When the European Parliament considered the issue of interception of telecommunications in 1998, its resolution underlined the importance of encryption.</p>
<p class="contents">The European research efforts and relatively open access to markets have created conditions that have enabled European enterprises to develop a world-class expertise and high-quality encryption products. It is worth noting that the United States government has recently taken steps to relax its export controls regime for encryption products.</p>
<p class="contents">The current rules for intra-community trade are laid down in the so-called dual-use regulation. For external trade, the Wassenaar arrangement imposes export controls on strong encryption products. The aim of export controls is to try to avoid undesired proliferation of these products to certain countries and to criminal organisations. The Commission recognises the need to balance availability of encryption products with concerns of public security and the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon European Council called on the Council and the Parliament to adopt – as rapidly as possible – still this year – the dual-use export control regime. The Commission hopes that the revision of dual-use regulation can be completed during the Portuguese presidency. Moreover, the budget for research for security and confidence-enhancing technologies has been increased in the 5th Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that enhancing the security of communications over the Internet by using encryption is a priority. The introduction of such products is not without complexities. Software whose source code is not open, leaves the user in uncertainty. The possibility of built-in circumvention of encryption cannot be excluded. Secondly, effective use of encryption requires a safe key management system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission’s own communications infrastructure is concerned, the Commission is working on introducing stronger European encryption products for its electronic communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to data protection. The Data Protection Directive of 24 October 1995 requires Member States to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data. In addition, Member States are under obligation to set up a Supervisory Authority responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions of this Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The data protection Directive is complemented by the Directive for data protection and privacy in the telecommunications sector. This Directive also concerns legal persons and requires providers of public telecommunications services to ensure the security and confidentiality of communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Both these directives exclude from their scope activities that fall outside Community competence. Article 1 of the telecommunications data protection directive reads: “<span class="italic">This Directive shall not apply to the activities which fall outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, and in any case to activities concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when activities relate to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law”.</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the titles V and VI referred to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to Justice and Home Affairs in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This wording of the directive reflects the wording of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When adopting these Directives, the Council and the Parliament sought to strike a balance between the right to privacy and the legitimate needs of law enforcement and public security. At the same time, activities outside Community competencies had to be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been entirely satisfied with the transposition of the data protection Directives. As regards the general data protection directive, the Commission has launched infringement procedures against six Member States. With regard to the telecom data protection directive, the Commission has also opened infringement proceedings against six Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the activities under the so-called Third Pillar, of which the President of the Council spoke with Mr Prodi today, a number of actions are under way with regard to law enforcement and the fight against crime, which include the issue of lawful interception of telecommunications for the purposes of criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned, the communications intelligence activities by intelligence agencies of Member States fall outside the scope of Community Law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been asked whether it can confirm the existence of the activities described in the report of Mr Campbell. It is the very nature of intelligence activities that those who are not involved in these activities are not able to confirm, nor deny their existence. However, it is clear that technological possibilities to intercept electronic communications exist. And there is no evidence to say that the available technologies are not used.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the recent allegations presented in the public debate, the Commission has sought clarification from the Member State that has been mentioned in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received a letter from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union. The letter states that the British intelligence agencies work within a legal framework laid down by the United Kingdom Parliament, and which sets out explicitly the purposes for which interception may be authorised, namely national security, safeguarding the nation’s economic well-being and the prevention and detection of serious crime. Further, the letter states that the European Commission of Human Rights has held that the system set out under British law is in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK legislation also foresees a special Parliamentary oversight committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also sought clarification from the United States government. We have yesterday received a letter from the United States Department of State, which states that the US intelligence community is not engaged in industrial espionage.

In the past, a great many parliamentary questions have been simply ignored. The present statement is therefore a step in the right direction, albeit only the first of what need to be quite a few such steps. We must now calmly consider what measures are to be taken in order to protect the European economy effectively. Less helpful in this regard are the hasty proposals tabled by the four smaller groups in this House. When I read in the proposal put forward by the Technical Group of Independent Members about fears of a “Super Echelon” which will apparently use surveillance techniques to gain control of the whole of the information society, then this shows with how little understanding of the facts the present state of affairs is being approached. What we have here is not Huxley’s “brave new world” taking shape, but merely industrial espionage. </p>
<p class="contents">With its proposal to establish a committee of inquiry, an alliance of Greens and of Members from the Left and Right of the political spectrum clearly want, however, to use Parliament as an arena for James Bond-style games. Who, I wonder, would call for a committee of inquiry? The American President or the head of the British secret service, who is not even known in Britain? What is this committee supposed to find out? The fact that Echelon exists and is also used for industrial espionage is something which we have known at least since the interview with former CIA Director Mr Woolsey on 7 March of this year. No, the time for investigations and debate is past. Now, we must act. In addition to frank words with our American and British friends, we need a European encryption system, independent of the United States, with which to protect our data. </p>
<p class="contents">We must put this subject on the agenda of the next session of the World Trade Conference. We must develop a code of conduct which guarantees compensation in the event of espionage systems’ being misused, and we must make it clearer to our businesses than we have done so far that they themselves are called upon to safeguard their own data through encryption. In contrast to a committee of inquiry, which in this case would serve no purpose, this would be a constructive initiative. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have issued this statement on behalf of Mr von Boetticher who, because of a bereavement, had to travel back to Germany yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just how difficult the situation is, you can see from two remarks made in the last three minutes. Mrs Klamt says that we all know that the United States of America engages in industrial espionage. The Commissioner has just explained to us that of course the United States does not engage in industrial espionage; they clarified this in writing only yesterday. So what is to be done, then? </p>
<p class="contents">After everything we have been told at the hearing in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the indication is, of course, that we should continue with the strategy which, as Social Democrats, we have believed to be correct. In the Committee, there were accusations against the Council and the Commission to the effect that individual EU citizens were insufficiently protected against the interception and monitoring of communications, that the competitive disadvantages to which the Echelon system is exposing the European economy are not being combated sufficiently in the context of the Community law governing the EU institutions and that no adequate counter-strategies are being developed. We then said that we wanted to hear what the Council and the Commission had to say before deciding how to proceed further. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that what I have heard this morning from both institutions gives rise to more questions than answers. The Social Democratic Group will therefore do what it already decided to do weeks ago in the light of present knowledge. Bearing in mind the statements by both institutions, we shall make decisions next week on the following issues. (In fact, there are no two ways about it, we shall have to make these decisions.) Do we want a committee of inquiry? Do we want a non-permanent committee? Do we want an own-initiative report? Do we want to take other measures in order to shed more light on the outstanding issues, to obtain more answers and, above all, to examine whether Community law has been broken? Precisely how we go about this, we shall decide next week, but one thing I would state clearly here is that, if we continue to adopt what, as I see it, is a dilatory approach to the problem, as I heard outlined by our partner institutions this morning, we shall not do justice to the political problem, or to the political drama, behind the questions raised here. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether we were well advised to say that we wanted a committee of inquiry because, if such a committee were to be set up, its legal basis would have to be impeccably clarified. In this regard, too, there are still questions to be answered. I was therefore of the opinion that it was too early for a committee of inquiry. I do not, however, want to exclude the possibility of our reaching conclusions in the course of the debate which will lead our Social Democrats to say, here in Parliament, that, even if there is the merest hint of suspicion that Community law has been broken and that citizens’ freedoms and the competitiveness of our industry and economy are not being adequately protected, then we shall act most decisively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot help saying, Madam President, that unfortunately I have not heard Minister Gomes of the Portuguese presidency say a word about the “Echelon” system. Not a single word. I would like to ask him, in fact to challenge him, to address this point before the end of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It was brought home to my group at the hearings that the “Echelon” system is actually an American espionage network. The question remains as to whether America will also use this military espionage network for industrial espionage, at the expense of European enterprises. Because if that was to be the case – and I agree with the Commissioner here – then of course this would be in flagrant contravention of the excellent alliance and trade relations that Europe has with America.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The examples cited in the investigations were not substantiated very well during the hearing of 23 February. Nevertheless, the ELDR Group believes that this matter must be taken seriously. Because if it is true, then citizens’ rights may be violated too. In any case, the ELDR Group wants to extend existing European legislation governing data protection to the sphere of judicial and police cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that the national parliaments in the European Union, as well as the United States Congress in Washington, should become involved in this matter. It is necessary for them to do so because this concerns an espionage network.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">After this debate the ELDR Group will consider if we think it is necessary to initiate a parliamentary inquiry. One of the deciding factors will be whether or not we receive a more detailed response from the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something, at least. Having said that, I was expecting the Council to give us some details about the problem we are trying to deal with today. I have to say I am disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">To use a sporting metaphor, the representatives of the Council and the Commission have been doing what I call the fencing side-step. It is very effective in fencing, but I dislike it in politics. I have no regrets whatsoever about having taken the initiative, with my group, in calling for a parliamentary committee of inquiry into this matter. I think the stature of the European Parliament will be enhanced by adopting such an initiative and I hope the whole of Parliament will support that position. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to point out that while speeches on the principle are of course interesting, we have to have the courage to talk about the facts. Eighteen months ago, during a debate in this same Parliament, when Mr Bangemann was the Commissioner responsible, he said, in answer to a number of questions from Members, that if the system existed it would represent a serious problem for human rights and the operation of the European Union. We have since discovered that this system does exist, but we do not know exactly how it works. There is good reason to believe that a European Union Member State – the United Kingdom, to make no bones about it – is collaborating in the system. I expected the Council Presidency to make a statement about that. Is the British Government being open about it? Is it collaborating in the system or not? I think we have a right to know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is responsible for ensuring that Community law is observed. We have good reason to believe that Community law is being flouted in this case. Directives are obviously fine if they are applied, but what use are they if there is clearly technology available for by-passing them? Especially when we know that certain Member States are probably collaborating in order to by-pass them. I am really very worried. If this Parliament seeks to represent the people of Europe, it really must clarify this situation. We will not be doing that if we routinely wait for initiatives from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to remind the House that we passed a resolution eighteen months ago calling for a proper open debate on this type of monitoring technology. In view of what I have just heard, there is no genuinely open debate. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we said effective economic protection systems and encryption must be adopted. Now we are told the same thing all over again, eighteen months later. Are we going to pass another resolution in Strasbourg repeating the 1998 resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">I honestly believe that it is now too late for that. Therefore, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must move into a higher gear and it is this Parliament’s duty, as the third institution of the Union, to spearhead the attack.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States now acknowledges the existence of the ‘Echelon’ system. Tongues are being loosened in certain Union governments. The press is crammed full of details about this all-pervasive electronic monitoring network.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, how embarrassed the Council and the Commission sounded! What tangled comments they made to avoid answering our questions. I did not hear the slightest explanation of why it was necessary to wait for Members of Parliament to discover this massive scandal nearly two years ago, and then recently for them to provide proof that their revelations were in fact true, before the Council would agree, in a very implicit and convoluted way, that there is indeed a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me restate the problem: by virtue of privileged and very special links, a strategic ally and a Member State are covertly joining forces to monitor private communications and spy on companies in other Union countries. Where is this taking us? With friends like that, who needs enemies? You will understand, Mr President, Commissioner, that with the truth now established, we feel entitled to ask you further regarding a number of questions that are on everyone’s mind today.</p>
<p class="contents">First, what do you know about the type of information this system intercepts, the ultimate recipients the information is sent to, and the reliability of the protection that exists in Europe for people’s privacy and firms’ strategic data? Secondly, apart from the formal exchange of correspondence the Commissioner mentioned, what serious action has it undertaken with regard to the United States Government on this matter and with what outcome? Thirdly, what can you tell us about the role played by the United Kingdom in this system, or at least the role it intends to play in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Whether people like it or not, the ‘Echelon’ file is now open and it will remain open. After the European Parliament, the matter has been taken up by other parliaments and indeed the United States Congress, which I have contacted, because what we are doing is not anti-American. Our fellow citizens have been alerted. So I want to warn Members who are still hesitant that trying to stop this movement now would be a rearguard action, and would probably be severely condemned by democratic opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and I have listened carefully to what has been said, particularly by the spokespersons for the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party – expectations would be fulfilled if we were to make progress together on truth, transparency and ethics in international relations. In tabling the call for a committee of inquiry, over a quarter of the Members of this Parliament have made that choice. I think Parliament will increase its stature by taking up this case by a majority.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will simply say that the revelation that the ‘Echelon’ electronic espionage network exists, and that it was set up by the United States national security agency, demonstrates utter disdain for the rights, freedoms and sovereignty of European countries. We would rather not believe this affair is indicative of a general attitude towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the circumstances we are stunned by the Council’s statement. The presidency began by stating an excellent principle – no communications interception system is admissible if it does not respect the principles of human dignity and the legislation of Member States – but the end of his statement was extremely muddled. It dealt with data transmission inside Europe, the Schengen Information System and Europol, none of which were really relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Actually, the question to the Council is extremely simple: are we going to demand the cessation of the ‘Echelon’ network’s activities, which violate human rights and freedoms? Or if this ‘Echelon’ network is really intended to combat international organised crime, Madam President, we must insist on being involved in it. We must shoulder our share of the burden and create an international organisation for that purpose. Otherwise the network should be closed down, and we are in favour of the parliamentary committee of inquiry called for by several groups in the European Parliament, including the Union for a Europe of Nations Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear from our discussion that this also has a downside. It appears to be very easy to intercept telephone conversations, including those between private individuals, using the worldwide espionage network ‘Echelon’. It seems unnecessary to me to bring the fact of Echelon’s existence up for discussion. Our main priority should be to take a close look at the consequences it will have in terms of policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is important to be aware that we cannot oppose the fact that these techniques are used. They are justified in the light of the fight against crime, arms supplies and international security. What is crucial in this respect is the legitimacy of usage. These techniques must not be used in the pursuit of profit. The right of individuals to privacy must not be contravened at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, we in Europe must search our own hearts too. We have some irregular espionage practices of our own. What is more, we are still lacking a definition of the legitimacy of espionage. We are going to have to tackle this issue in the course of the transatlantic debate, so that citizens in every corner of the globe can count on receiving the same level of protection of their privacy. As matters stand, America is protecting the right to privacy of its own citizens whilst Washington appears to think nothing of violating the rights of non-Americans via worldwide espionage networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is obviously a shock, not in terms of our technical knowledge of encryption, but in terms of our political beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have believed in the great market as if it were God, and competition and competitiveness, all under the governance of the WTO. With Mr Monti, and Mr Van Miert before him, we have done everything possible to keep competition pure and perfect, even against the interests of our own businesses, our banks, our airlines, our insurance companies, Crédit Lyonnais, Rhone-Poulenc. And now we find out that people are cheating and spying on this market, creating distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, which wanted to use OLAF to spy on Members for the sake of protecting Europe’s financial interests, is discovering that we are being spied on by the United States against our financial interests, even as regards the WTO negotiations. We thought Mr Haider’s Austria was endangering our freedom. But it is through Mr Tony Blair’s Britain, Glyn Ford’s Britain, that fifteen thousand agents, stationed in Gibraltar, Cyprus, and even on British territory, are spying on us. So, Madam President, are you still prepared to go to London? Will you ever go to Sydney again? Will you ever go to Ottawa or Wellington again?</p>
<p class="contents">And we thought there was solidarity in Europe. Now we find that Britain’s solidarity extends across the Atlantic and across the Pacific Ocean. We thought we were building Europe, making Europe stronger. But stronger than whom? Stronger in opposition to Iraq? In opposition to the Serbs? Stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism? But with ‘Echelon’, we find that Boeing belongs to a specific nation, Rayton belongs to a specific nation, and they are having people spy on Airbus or Thomson because those companies do not belong to the same nation. ‘Echelon’ brings us face to face with nationalism, but it is the ethnic nationalism of the Anglo-Saxon ethnic group, which includes Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. It is an ethnic group with a religious base, the holy alliance of Adam Smith and Calvin.</p>
<p class="contents">So is the Catholic Europe of Gasperi, Schuman and Adenauer going to apologise? Apologise to the people spied on, for all that evangelism? ‘Echelon’ is the French word for rung, and I am afraid this ‘Echelon’ is taking us down to the bottom rung and we will end up at dignity level zero. Poor old European Commission! Poor old European Council of Ministers! Poor old European Union! We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth. Something born of a Harvard University lecture theatre under the presidency of the American, General Marshall, is bound to end up obeying its creator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have several questions to put to the Council and the Commission and if they do not wish to answer them today, then I would ask them to do so in writing in the very near future. </p>
<p class="contents">It emerged during the hearing that two companies have reported missing out on orders on account of industrial espionage.

You know only too well what I am driving at.</p>

<p class="contents">My third question relates to Article 3. Mr Woolsey, the former Director of the CIA, writes in the Wall Street Journal of 22 March last that dual use technology is most definitely attracting increased attention from the United States. I would like to ask the Council how this additional security system relating to dual use technology and operating from the United States works? Can you give an insight into the kind of special role the American Security Services will have in this?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My fourth question to the Commission is as follows: there is a directive on data protection. This directive imposes obligations on those who offer services to networks, but software does not appear to have been considered. My first question is this: is the European Commission prepared to close this software loophole in the course of a review of this directive? My second question to the Commission is: will the European Commission examine the proportionality of measures taken by the Member States in respect of the permitted exceptions in the European data protection directive, as part of its task to oversee the correct transposition of European directives in national legislation? What have your findings been in this sphere? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mr Gomes for the Council and Mr Liikanen for the Commission this morning have both made very clear statements. As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members’ concerns. This morning, and in recent days in particular, we have read and heard a lot of allegations. Even today we have heard talk of James Bond, of American espionage and we have had the rantings of the madman to my left a few moments ago. But today, and in the Citizens’ Rights Committee, we have had few real facts because of the secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, after all, the nature of intelligence and military information work. If it was not secret and we all knew about it, it would not serve the purpose for which it would be intended and necessary. Members will therefore understand that it is the practice in the United Kingdom Government, like, I imagine, most or all other governments, not to comment on alleged interception whether the allegations are based on trivia or something perhaps more substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Liikanen has said, everything done in the United Kingdom is in line with a proper legal framework. Everything is subject to close parliamentary scrutiny in the House of Commons. We have very tight controls, both independent controls and control that emanates from the Secretary of State with the full consent of the United Kingdom Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally and importantly, I want to reiterate that everything that has been conducted, or will be conducted, is in complete conformity with United Kingdom law, with United States law and, most importantly, is done with complete respect for, and in complete conformity with, the European Convention on Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are not sure about is whether this system has been redirected, not at purely military and defence objectives, but at commercial, industrial and technological targets. We fear and suspect this, however.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">I therefore have three questions. The first is to the Council and the Commission. What does the term ‘fair trade’ mean when major American companies can gain unlawful advantages thanks to privileged information provided by this system?</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what do civil liberties, a principle on everyone’s lips, mean to us when the privacy of our Heads of State, our elected representatives and our people can be violated other than for reasons of combating crime and without a court order, as required by our laws? How do the Council and the Commission think the USA would react if it knew that Europe could intercept the communications of its president, elected representatives and people?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how can we defend ourselves against this threat? The Commissioner has spoken of work on cryptography, which was also mentioned in Parliament’s last recommendation. However, what specifically has been done to reinforce the cryptography system and to invest in European technology which is our best defence against this threat? What comments might the Council and the Commission have on France’s recent decision to remove commercial closed source code systems from its public computer systems, thus allowing open source code systems to be used, which is intended, as indicated by the French Defence Minister, to guarantee that no nation and no defence systems are at the mercy of a single person or a single company?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need tighter controls to guarantee the fundamental rights of the people and to protect European companies, and we need political initiatives which ensure that the Member States cooperate more closely and keep each other informed of agreements concluded with third countries on this matter. Legislation must be updated and harmonised and supervisory authorities simplified and consolidated and, of course, new technologies are needed to protect telecommunications from disproportionate and unjustified interference. This is a complex assembly of measures which have only been timidly, belatedly and in part announced by the Council and the Commission. Parliament must also support all the measures necessary to ascertain the truth, and be constantly, intensely vigilant even when all this has died down, for without transparent authorities and guaranteed individual rights, there can be no faith in democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is it true – and this is a matter for the Commission and the Council – that representatives of the Commission and the Council have been working, under the chairmanship of the Americans, on Echelon-compatible European telecommunications standards, including interception options, and this within the framework of ILETS, a so-called institute? This then provided us with the notorious Infopol documents. How great is the damage which has already been caused to the European economy? Are there companies in addition to Thomson and the Airbus consortium which have sustained damage? What will the Council and the Commission do, and how will they deal with those Member States of the European Union who are spying on their partners in the Union in order – as, in fact, has been admitted – to protect their economic well-being? How will the Commission and the Council respond to the answer from the Americans, which was read out today and which clearly contradicts what, for example, ex-CIA director Mr Woolsey has stated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to quickly make the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I did refer, more than once, specifically to the Echelon system. I unequivocally condemned this and stated that the Council cannot accept the creation or existence of a system for intercepting telecommunications which does not respect the laws of the Member States. Mr Wiebenga said that I did not clearly and specifically condemn Echelon. I did do so and I do so again. It is clearly apparent from this debate that the key issue is not whether or not a system for intercepting telecommunications exists but what use is made of this system.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I must add the following comment in response to Mr van Velzen. The Council has no information allowing it to conclude that any company, including the companies mentioned, has benefited or been damaged as a result of telecommunications being intercepted by this system. If we had any specific information on this, the Council would not hesitate to adopt a clear position. I can only answer the Member’s second question in writing, as I do not have precise information on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell this House that the concerns voiced here are of course shared by the presidency. Therefore, at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council on 29 to 30 May, the Portuguese presidency will ensure that the Council debates this issue so that we can adopt a position. We will keep Parliament constantly informed of developments in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there is one point which has been raised by a few Parliamentarians which is fundamentally important, namely to guarantee that there will be strong European encryption products. It is very important to increase the awareness of the European citizens and companies that electronic communications need to be encrypted to guarantee confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, there have been programmes for eighteen months. The European research programmes have been relatively successful and it is recognised also in the discussions in other countries that European competence in this area is confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to the question of Mr van Velzen on the software and data privacy in telecommunications. As Mr van Velzen knows, we are working now with the review of telecommunications legislation and this issue must be analysed in that context and I will reply to you very soon in writing where I will reply to the rest of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berger asked whether some companies have been losing contracts because of espionage. No companies have contacted the Commission on that issue. As to the question about the United States and the UK: the reason why we asked for clarification recently was the interviews which were given by a former official of the intelligence agency of the United States. For that reason we contacted the United States government and asked for clarification and what I said here was their reply to that very issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, these are very important and sensitive areas and we must be very firm that confidentiality and privacy in telephone and telecommunications can be guaranteed. The European Court of Human Rights took a decision some time ago when they said “tapping and other forms of interception of telephone conversations represent a serious interference with private life and correspondence and must accordingly be based on a law that is particularly precise. It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the subject especially as the technology available for users is continually becoming more sophisticated”.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this decision is very clear. The Commission will, in all its actions, respect these principles and we will not fail to act under the obligations of the Treaty if any Community law is breached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
