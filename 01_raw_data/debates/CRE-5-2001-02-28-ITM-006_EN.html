<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I am glad of this opportunity to update you on the most recent developments in relation to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom. You will be aware that the first outbreak was confirmed on 20 February in the evening. The Commission adopted a safeguard decision the following day, that is on 21 February, at a Commission meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure imposed a ban on the export from the UK of certain live animals, that is cattle, sheep and goats, and restrictions on the export of meat, meat products, milk, milk products and certain animal products. It also provided for a review of the decision of the Standing Veterinary Committee on 27 February. This very prompt action has been criticised in some quarters as a panic reaction. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is an essential and very necessary reaction to a highly infectious disease with potentially huge economic and trade consequences for the entire European Union, some of which you have heard about from Mrs Schreyer just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I am encouraged that the decision was strongly supported by the Agriculture Council last Monday. It is also supported by the farming community throughout the European Union including in the UK, as farmers are conscious of the grave threat to their livelihood from this particular disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the number of outbreaks has continued to increase and currently amounts to 22. There are a number of worrying aspects to this outbreak which I should enumerate for you.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it has been detected in several different counties in Britain with a widespread geographical distribution. Secondly, it has been found not only in farms but in abattoirs, dealers’ premises and collection points. Furthermore, there were exports of potentially infected susceptible animals, in particular sheep, to other Member States before confirmation of the outbreak took place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the UK for its very firm action to bring the outbreak under control. The UK imposed a complete restriction on the movement of livestock in Britain on 23 February in order to reduce the further spread of the disease. This ban has been prolonged for another fortnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the incubation period of this disease the impact of this measure is not yet fully apparent. The Commission is obviously keeping the situation under constant review and we are in continual contact with the veterinary authorities in the UK and in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation was reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee yesterday. In the light of the update on the current situation from the UK representative and the views of the Member States’ veterinary experts, the Commission services proposed the following. Firstly, the extension of the current ban until 9 March. That decision was taken at a Commission meeting this morning. Secondly, Member States shall take any precautionary measures including the isolation of susceptible animals and preventive killing of such animals exported from the UK between 1 and 21 February. The Standing Veterinary Committee gave a favourable opinion to this proposal and it will now be approved by the Commission with a view to entry into force before the expiry of the current decision at midnight on 1 March.</p>
<p class="contents">The new decision will expire at midnight on 9 March 2001 and will be reviewed at the Standing Veterinary Committee scheduled to take place on 6 and 7 March. Our current approach is focused on stamping out the disease. We would only turn to vaccination as a last resort, since it would call into question the disease status of the European Union and involve very significant future costs for the farming community and for exporters. Clearly we have to be very concerned with the present situation. The stakes are very high and the costs of failing to bring the outbreak under control are very high. In addition, the timing of the outbreak, as the BSE crisis continues to do its damage, could not be worse.</p>
<p class="contents">I will caution, however, against drawing any immediate conclusions. For example, the outbreak is already being attributed to poor controls on imports and the intensive nature of agricultural production in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we will be considering all these issues in the coming weeks and months in our investigations into the origins of this disease. However, we should not overlook the fact that the Community has been hugely successful in achieving its current status on foot-and-mouth disease, at least up to a couple of weeks ago. Vaccination ended in 1991, which has since saved European farmers over EUR 1 billion. It has also allowed Member States to export to countries which insist on imports only from countries which are recognised to be foot-and-mouth disease free and which do not follow the vaccination policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, there have been no cases other than in Italy in 1993 and a number of incursions of the disease in Greece next to the Turkish border. Prior to the implementation of the non-vaccination policy in 1991 hundreds of outbreaks were recorded each year. My firm intention is to maintain that success. I hope that I can count on your support for the present zero- tolerance approach towards this disease. I would now like to hear your views on the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express to the farming community in the United Kingdom our great sympathy and concern with this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to colleagues from the mainland continent of Europe that we sincerely hope that we have not exported the disease to mainland Europe.

The current precautions in connection with BSE have been eclipsed by the dangerous foot-and-mouth epidemic. I remember back in the 1950s, when whole villages were quarantined in order to prevent the epidemic from spreading. How are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced, Commissioner? What I mean is, anyone who still fails post-BSE to comply with regulations should be taught a serious lesson using other means. How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations? You said that culling and the travelling ban are currently the main objectives. How prepared are you to vaccinate animals which must surely be scattered throughout Europe on a strategic basis in order to help prevent the disease from spreading? Are you well prepared? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was my request in the Agriculture Committee that we had a debate on this and I much appreciate your coming. I also echo Mr Adam’s feelings. I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to those in Britain affected by it and my sorrow that we may have exported this disease. On that note, I would like to say how worried we are. However, it is vitally important that we use everything within our power to stop a future occurrence of this. I want to know whether or not you will be looking – and you did indicate this in your speech – at strengthening phytosanitary measures so that we can have healthy, safe food within the United Kingdom and within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commissioner answer two quick questions.

We are not considering it as an option except as a last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in those circumstances it would be necessary to seek the views of the Standing Veterinary Committee and, indeed, to bring the proposal before the Agriculture Council for its consideration. It would entail huge costs and potential loss of trade. It would be an enormous decision with many implications. Therefore the time scale would reflect the difficult nature of such a decision and the need for widespread consultation with the bodies that I have indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The next question relates to how the Commission and the European Union is prepared for the travelling ban. It is the function of the Commission and the legislative authorities in the European Union to put in place legislation at EU level and it is for the Member States on the ground to implement that legislation. Therefore to ban movements from the UK, legislation was first of all implemented at UK level. There is also EU legislation. This was considered at the meetings of the Standard Veterinary Committee and there are continuing contacts between the veterinary services of the UK, our own veterinary services at the Commission and, indeed, other veterinary services as necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Susceptible animals have been identified and are under active surveillance. Indeed, as you are probably aware, many animals have already been destroyed.</p>

Obviously, there is active surveillance of the situation. Authorities are keeping the farm under close surveillance and it has been closed. I will have clarification of that situation later in the day.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your own constituency of Wexford, Mrs Doyle, I do not have any reports of the rumours that you reported. Nothing has been brought to my attention in relation to that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to surveillance at borders, this is a matter for Member States themselves. I can assure you that, from my contacts with Member States and, indeed, from their own observation of the situation, they are perfectly well aware of the seriousness of the situation. Focus must be on the restriction of live animals and then also on animal products.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware, from reports that have been made available to me, that Member States are taking the kind of precautions that we would regard as being suitable to eliminate movement and to try to ensure the lowest level of risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf asked me about compensation. As you may have heard from Mrs Schreyer when she spoke earlier this afternoon, compensation is available. There is a budget line for this kind of situation but, as she indicated to you, there are budgetary limits. I understand that approximately EUR 50 million a year are available for this. I am not aware of the exact amount of money available for an issue such as this, but I believe it is somewhat less than EUR 50 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne asked me about the differentiation in designation between regions and countries. The situation is that any third country that has an outbreak of foot-and-mouth in any particular region is precluded from exporting products to the European Union. This is done as a result of legislation which requires that any product exported must be accompanied by a certificate stating that it is free of foot-and-mouth. If a region is incapable of providing that certification, then the product cannot be exported. That has been the situation in the past and continues to be the situation and it has applied in a situation quite recently.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question relating to the small abattoirs, I did touch on this earlier in my own statement. I would refer again to what I said in my statement and repeat that foot-and-mouth disease was a bigger problem in the past than it is now. I gave you instances of what outbreaks there have been in the more recent past, one in Italy and a small one in Greece on the Turkish border.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been remarkably free in the European Union from foot-and-mouth disease over that period of time. With regard to any application for or any authorisation of compensation to the UK, we are awaiting any application for compensation and it will obviously be given the appropriate consideration in the usual way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, in answer to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, you stated that everything connected to fraud was actually within the jurisdiction of the Member States. While that may be true, the Commission must still ensure that there are sufficient staff resources to monitor this work. In that respect, what progress has been made by your directorate and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate? However dedicated they are, do you have enough staff resources at the current time to adequately monitor all the urgent assignments they receive, this being the last problem in line following BSE and so many others? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: I feel you were rather quick to dismiss the fact that local abattoirs are not a solution to this type of problem, for small local abattoirs today are not what they were fifty years ago. Therefore, is the fact that they are local not a solution to the unfolding crises? This has been seen clearly in Great Britain, particularly with the problem of the long-distance transportation of animals, which apparently engenders and spreads the epidemic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the event that there is any evidence of fraud in Member States then there is an obligation to investigate this fully. The Member State in question will be required to do so, and the Commission will have a direct interest in ensuring that was done.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of small abattoirs: I can only repeat what I said earlier that the last case of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK was in the 1960s. The fact that we have had bigger abattoirs in the meantime over the last 20-year period tends to indicate that there is not necessarily a correlation between big or small abattoirs and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth. However, all issues are kept under review and this situation this will obviously be one of the issues that will be taken into account. We must be careful not to look for magic solutions and make knee-jerk reactions as to causes. That is one aspect that will be weighed in the balance in coming to a conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 30 million doses of vaccine in the European Union. On the question of whether foot-and-mouth disease can infect humans, the position here appears to be that if there is any infection, it is an extremely mild form causing very mild symptoms and very few cases. In other words, it is not understood to be a public health problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha then asked me about countries where exports had taken place. I am sure that information is available in my DG. I do not have the information at my finger tips, but I understand that in all probability the list will include Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The UK has kept my DG fully up-to-date on all developments. I personally receive faxes and I have had a number of conversations with the relevant minister, Mr Nick Brown, on these issues.

I fully agree with your assessment that the only panic that can come from this situation is by people irresponsibly drawing attention to what does not exist, which is a threat to human health. I am very happy that you raised that question and gave me an opportunity to emphasise that point yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the application for compensation, as you are probably aware this is an issue that falls within the competence of my colleague, Mr Fischler, but I understand that the UK authorities intend to make an application and it may very well be in the pipeline. I am aware that this constitutes an enormous impact on farming incomes, and this is something that has been fully taken into account in all deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Food and Veterinary Office, no FVO report is available yet, but I should say that no options will be ruled out with regard to vaccinations. As I said earlier, however, this would only be regarded as a last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">The question from Mr Maat concerns different levels of performance in different Member States. I strongly believe that Member States fully understand the seriousness of the situation. Member States are taking the appropriate action, given the level of exposure that they believe exists in their own Member State. I am satisfied, for instance, that one Member State alone has destroyed 47 000 sheep without any positive finding in any one of them. Other Member States have also destroyed large numbers of sheep, and markets and so on in a number of Member States have also been closed. Movements have been restricted. The Member States, particularly those at risk of having imported sheep from the UK, are taking the appropriate action. With regard to that, traceability has worked very well but there are limitations. We cannot ensure individual identification of sheep and pigs in all instances.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cushnahan then asked me about whether there should be criminal prosecution in the event of fraud. That is an issue that Member States are responsible for themselves. It is not the duty of the Commission to require Member States to initiate such criminal prosecutions. But in the event of any persistent failure of a Member State to implement the laws of the European Union, there is scope for the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings. That does not arise in this instance, but I am satisfied that in the event that there is evidence of criminal activity – and I am sure you are referring to the UK when you asked me this question Mr Cushnahan – that the UK authorities will be well aware of the fact that prosecutions of this type are appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the last part of your question as to whether I believe it is appropriate for the political party you identify to have restricted its <span class="italic">Árd Fheis</span>, firstly let me say that I do not follow the affairs of all small parties in the European Union. Another concern that might well have motivated him is: would anybody have turned up out of lack of interest?</p>

You say that it has to be licensed. I think there are problems with this licensing. When cases break out in these countries there is a time lag. All this needs to be tightened up. You need to be absolutely certain that meat from countries that have foot-and-mouth disease infection cannot enter the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to join with other colleagues and say how terrible it has been for the farming community in Britain. The farmers feel that the gods have deserted them entirely after BSE, and now foot-and-mouth. Can I also ask as regards compensation whether it is possible for the Commission to consider compensation, not only for those farmers that are directly hit by foot-and-mouth disease, but those that are also closed down by not being able to move their livestock? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But it is at a time like this that you realise how mobile animals are. You need only look at the map and see the distances they travel. Mrs Doyle referred to the scare in my home county in my constituency in Northern Ireland. We had hoped that we would get away with it unscathed but it shows just how dangerous and highly contagious this disease is, through the way animals move. At this time those animals have all been tested. I have been in touch with my local veterinary department. There is cooperation with the government of the Republic of Ireland and indeed a perimeter has been set which happens to straddle the border between the two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner one question. He referred to intensive farming. Would he not agree with me that the hype being put forward in the media about intensive farming/factory farming has nothing to do with all this? In fact in 1967 when the last outbreak occurred, the type of farming we have now did not exist. Would he not agree with me that this is the case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to compensation, the position here is that we can only compensate within the regulations, which does not include loss of production. On travel, I confirm that this particular disease can be wind-borne.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Nicholson I would repeat what I said earlier in relation to this issue about intensive and extensive farming. I do not believe that particular issue is a significantly relevant issue to this particular outbreak of the disease. I know that there is some speculation in the media in relation to this and obviously in all our deliberations about how this disease came about and how it has spread, this will be one of the issues that will be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
