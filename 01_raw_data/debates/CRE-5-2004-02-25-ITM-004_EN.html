It spells out the political priorities for 2005 and the initiatives necessary for their implementation. It also outlines the budgetary guidelines needed to ensure the priority initiatives are adequately funded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer will comment on this last point. I will focus on the first issue I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">As of two years ago, it has become our custom to engage in a structured dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council on an annual basis. Given the special issues pertaining to 2004, the structured dialogue will take the form of a meeting of the Commission and the Conference of Committee Presidents to be held in April. Subsequently, there will be the opportunity to take stock at a second meeting with the Conference of Presidents in September.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that this is a transition year and that our institutions are due to pass the baton on to their successors. This is what makes the dialogue so vitally important. We have the crucial job of ensuring continuity of operation for our institutions in the best possible manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The process in hand is special as it is directed not only at the budgetary authority but also at the incoming Commission. It is important to guarantee continuity and consistency of the Commission’s policies and the fulfilment of our institutional obligations. This is what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">These, therefore, are our objectives. The first is to guarantee continuity. We need to pass the baton on smoothly to the next Commission. When the latter starts work, it will have to confirm or amend the priorities we are presenting here today. Our second objective is to prepare the ground for the incoming Commission in order to preserve the margin of manoeuvre on political and budgetary issues. Our third is to guarantee consistency with previously established strategic guidelines, especially the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 will be the first full year with a Commission of 25 members, a Union of 25 Member States, a new Commission and a new Parliament. It will therefore be the duty of this new Commission to begin to apply a political agenda consistent with its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, 2005 will be a key year as regards concluding the negotiations on the adoption of the package for subsequent financial perspectives. This matter has to be resolved before the end of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Some very important issues will need to be borne in mind at the many meetings planned. These include the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, and reconsideration of the sustainable development strategy. I should point out that the aim is now long-lasting development and this calls for new measures to adjust and improve implementation. Other important issues will include defining the new social agenda, consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice<span class="bold"> </span>and concluding accession negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria. The report on Turkey will have to be presented before the end of the year. In the light of that report it should be possible to decide on the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">At international level, the focus in 2005 will largely remain on issues relating to international security and stability, the fight against terrorism and the rebuilding of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the priorities we propose. Allow me to emphasise once again that they will have to be ratified by the new Commission. The main objective is to see the enlargement process through appropriately, thus ensuring its success. This involves shaping the Europe of the future and moulding what already exists. It also involves ensuring correct operation of the enlarged Europe and full implementation of policies and standards in all Member States, new and old alike.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we have identified three priorities. The first is competitiveness and cohesion. The second is security and European citizenship. The third is external responsibility, association and neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When considering the first priority, it is necessary to keep the most recent economic results in mind. They cannot be classified as anything but mediocre for the European Union as a whole. The persistent stagnation of our productivity and employment levels should also be taken into account, together with our desire successfully to integrate the new Member States. Reactivating growth should be the main political objective. This should be achieved by working unceasingly to improve the competitiveness of the European model whilst maintaining prosperity and cohesion and without abandoning key elements such as sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is security and European citizenship. It is essential to remember that enlarging Europe both in terms of its territory and of its population will call for additional effort and greater coordination. This will be essential in responding to the challenges involved in dealing with the new common borders, the increased mobility of people within the area and the need to ensure security.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will have to manage a land border over 6 000 kilometres long and a maritime border totalling over 85 000 kilometres. There are already well over 15 million third-country nationals resident in the European Union and a further 1.5 million or so arrive every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement brings the question of the diversity of cultures and of the peoples of Europe into sharper focus. It presents us with the new challenge of European citizenship as an additional dimension of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the third priority is the role of the European Union in the world, that is, its external responsibilities. Issues of association and neighbouring countries are especially important. The new dimension of the European Union, the new post-enlargement external borders mean there must be a stable and comprehensive political framework encompassing our neighbours to the south and east. The Commission will therefore implement a new Union policy for neighbouring countries, aimed at those that do not wish to join the European Union. In addition, the Commission’s external action will be determined by the following objectives. Firstly, to contribute to the enlargement process presently under way. This entails preparing for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Further to the decisions taken in 2004, the Commission will also pursue the pre-accession strategy with Turkey. It may also be possible to begin active negotiations with Croatia, if suitable progress is made.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning of my speech, Mrs Schreyer will provide details concerning human and financial resources. I would, however, like to make it clear to you that the situation regarding these two issues is currently both critical and delicate, as she will explain in a few moments’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal represents the minimum action necessary to ensure this institution will be able to shoulder its institutional responsibilities taking account of enlargement, and above all, of the new policies envisaged by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that within the framework of the outstanding interinstitutional cooperation that has characterised the budgetary process, and in the knowledge of the support of this House, it will be possible to respond appropriately to these challenges.</p>

<p class="contents">The Financial Perspective, which, last year, we adjusted to take account of enlargement, lays down the financial framework for the coming financial year. The adjustment was made in accordance with the decisions taken in Copenhagen and in line with the amendments introduced by your House. The decisions taken in Copenhagen, as set down in the accession treaties, set out the financial commitments made to the new Member States. In addition, the Council has made decisions concerning the augmentation of pre-accession aid for Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, which means that enlargement has left its unmistakeable stamp on the changes in the 2005 Budget in comparison with this year’s. Whilst the enlargement of the EU is a great gain in political, economic and ecological terms, it also presents challenges to the new Member States, who must implement all the EU’s laws, and also to the Commission, which, as guardian of the treaties, must ensure that they do so, and that their integration over the coming years is successful.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, there will have to be changes in the Commission’s personnel. As long ago as 2002, the Commission presented the overall development plan, according to which a total of 3 900 new posts are necessary. It is planned that there will be 700 additional posts in 2005, and we will be asking the budgetary authority to approve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also take this opportunity to follow my fellow-Commissioner Mrs Loyola de Palacio in extending very warm thanks to the budgetary authority, and most especially to Parliament. You have been very supportive of the Commission over the past years, and we continue to count on your support, which will enable the new Commission, too, to cope with the demands made upon it, and the tasks it has to perform, as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2005, the Financial Perspective plans a framework of EUR 114 billion, with upper limits for the financial commitments that we are capable of taking on in internal and external policies, as well as in administrative expenditure, that are lower than provided for in the programmes; the reason for this is that prices have needed less adjustment because of exchange rate fluctuations. We will therefore have very little room for manoeuvre next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Secretaries-General of the institutions will, over the coming days, be presenting a report on how we are going to manage with this tight budget. Even though funds for new initiatives, in both the internal and external policy spheres, are very limited, the Commission is nevertheless proposing, for 2005, new initiatives and increased resources in line with our priorities, for example, in transport and energy, for the preparation of a European air traffic management system; in the area of industrial policy, for the establishment of agency for the testing of chemical substances; in justice and internal affairs, for the further development of the Schengen Information System, whilst, in the field of research, there is a need for more funding for the decontamination of nuclear research facilities. Those are just a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">In foreign policy, we need to do what we have undertaken to do in the various areas – our commitments to combat Aids, action measures in Kosovo, and cooperation with non-governmental organisations in strengthening democracy. We are at present reckoning on a financial commitment to Iraq still being needed in 2005, so we will again have to have recourse to the flexibility instrument if we are to be able to perform the tasks that the European Union has taken on.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Vice-President has already explained, the discussions on the 2005 Budget will relate to all institutions in the new framework or with changes in their composition. It will be a new experience for the Council to adopt a Budget for 25 Member States. Although there will be a newly-elected Parliament as early as first reading, it is a very good thing that, in the person of Mr Garriga Polledo, we have appointed a principal rapporteur who is very experienced and who will ensure continuity in the debates.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a change of Commission between the first and second readings of the 2005 Budget. In purely institutional terms, we will see many new faces in the 2005 Budget procedure. On 16 March, we will be having a trialogue to discuss the priorities for the 2005 Budget, and I am confident that we – having succeeded in doing so in earlier years – will be able without delay to come to an agreement about them, so that the European Budget for 2005 can, once more, be a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would like the Commission for its part to understand the problems the delay experienced has already caused Parliament. For the first time, Parliament is going to implement a budgetary year in the light of the evaluation report based on the annual policy strategy document. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioners if they undertake to keep to the schedule the Budget Commissioner just outlined. I would like confirmation of this. No further delay is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as Commissioner Schreyer is aware, Parliament has already reached its own positions on the financial perspective. It has reached positions on fundamental issues such as safeguarding our parliamentary rights and the length of financial perspectives. Parliament has already made its views known on the latter. A position was also reached on our priorities for the future. We would like the political priorities of what is to be financed to be absolutely clear before any ceilings are fixed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as regards further enlargements, you will be aware that this House is of the opinion that it is essential to ensure beforehand that the European Union has both the institutional and the financial capacity to absorb new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the categories, be assured that, as on other occasions, Parliament will support you on the new posts, as long as we engage in a rational dynamic process. In any case, we shall require a fuller definition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the financing of category 4, I think you should really approach the Council, Commissioner, notably the signatories of the so-called ‘One per cent letter’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we really have to stress the fact that enlarging by adding ten new Member States is no trifling matter, and the public expect the European institutions to apply the law even-handedly from the word go. Doing that also requires the necessary complement of personnel, not least, of course, where languages are involved, and we have to guarantee that those positions will be filled.</p>
<p class="contents">I will answer your last question as to what the 2005 Budget will be like by saying that we have of course not got as far as a draft Budget, but it is already plain that the Council has already decided on certain increases. What this means is that there are more or less external factors that we have to take on board, and our consequent decisions have to respond to this reality. I would see it as a very bad sign if, just before enlargement, we were to start questioning the decisions taken in Copenhagen. Nobody wants to do that, and we will of course take that into account in the preliminary draft Budget. I can assure the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 will be submitted in due time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do you not agree that we all share in responsibility for the fact that this Europe of ours has not, over recent years, seen sufficient growth and enough job creation, and that this is a very important task for the new Commission? Now that there has been talk at this tripartite summit of a super-Commissioner or Commission Vice-President with responsibilities for economic reform, do you not also think that, if there is to be such a person, he or she should primarily have responsibility for growth and employment, since we will find it difficult to advance the European ideal if we fail to prioritise these two things?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to something originally mentioned by Mrs Flemming: the Roma and Sinti. In the enlarged Europe, after Bulgaria and Romania have joined it, there will be 8 million Roma and Sinti, living in social conditions that are extremely difficult, and more difficult than in many Member States. Are you willing, at this early stage, to prepare the forthcoming Budget in such a way that there will be more financial support for the integration of Roma and Sinti in our society – even though it is more than just money that is needed? If not, we will face conflicts flagrantly contradicting the ideal of unifying Europe.</p>

As it is unfortunately impossible for Mr Prodi to be in two places at once, he is not in the House today.</p>
<p class="contents">I prefer not to comment on the absence of the Council. I can certainly say, however, that we all like to have the three institutions together in this House. We would have welcomed the Council’s presence.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the issue of employment and growth, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to discuss the question of the Super-Commissioner. It will be for the incoming Commission to decide on how to organise a Commission of 25 members. According to the Treaty of Nice, the new President will have extensive competence in that regard. I think it is possible for it to be very well organised and to function very well. A 25 member Commission does not necessarily spell trouble. The opposite is actually the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do fully agree with you on the need to find a way of strengthening industrial policies. Mr Liikanen has worked hard on this over the years. It stands to reason, however, that it is essential to make further progress on this in the light of the new phenomenon of globalisation. It is also essential to develop external trade, as the two are closely linked.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue, competitiveness and cohesion, involves both the aforementioned aspects. There is discussion of matters such as access to public markets and trans-European networks. There is discussion of the growth measures associated with the policy and strategy for growth. This relates to decisions taken at Lisbon and to the proposals made at the last European Council in Brussels. Issues such as moving forward with proposals concerning the interaction between industrial policy and other Community policies feature also. There are proposals to improve and simplify legislation relating to key industrial sectors. The aim is to strengthen competitiveness in sectors such as the automobile industry, construction, the cosmetics industry and the information society. As regards employment, there is also discussion of issues relating to the social aspects, amongst others. In short, I would like to say that many political measures are being considered with precisely this objective in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, Mr Swoboda is absolutely right. We need to restore growth. We need to achieve strong growth levels in order to move forward and absorb the new Member States. We need enlargement to be successful. We all hope and expect it will be.</p>

Of that, I too am convinced, and I think it highly important that this Commission should not merely be open to twenty-five members, but should also be credible, strong and capable of putting its policies into practice. The issues around the Stability and Growth Pact show just how important that is; this is where the Commission has already passed a test and has yet to pass another by backing stability and growth and safeguarding the policies and principles underlying them. That is in the interests of all of us, as ‘business and growth’ and ‘stability and growth’ are the two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">Something, though, that I regard as a very important area, and about which I would like to ask you a question, is security policy, involving judicial cooperation, security and freedom in an enlarged European Union. Resources are available for it, and it is a very important area. Where, in it, do you want the specific policy priorities to be – in securing borders or combating drugs? The citizens of the European Union expect enlargement to bring greater security rather than to diminish it, and for this the funding must be guaranteed, so that the external borders can be properly secured, and methodologies developed to effectively combat international crime and illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have examined this question with particular care, and it is quite clear that enlargement will greatly strengthen these minorities in their rights and, above all, protect them. In consequence, I believe that these minorities will themselves welcome the enlargement of the European Union. As far as the financial and social dimension is concerned, the new Member States will have access to the Social Funds, which share in funding special programmes vital to the integration of minorities. In 2005, the new Member States will be able to draw on a total of EUR 900 million from the European Social Fund, and I believe it important that we should ensure that some of this money is applied for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the security issues, this is an area in which the Council has taken more and more decisions; in no other area has the Council adopted so many new resolutions over recent years as in the area of justice and internal affairs, and it goes without saying that these must also be backed up by funding. In 2005, for example, it is planned that more funding should be made available for the Schengen Information System than had previously been planned, increasing the amount by an additional EUR 4 million. If I may mention just a couple of courses of action, proposals have been made for funding the conversion of the European Police College into a European institution for training senior police officers, and the network of national training institutes is to be built up. I would also point out that, over recent years, we have also greatly increased the number of staff working in this area. If I may quantify this, in 1999, there were 82 posts allocated to this area, whereas next year there will be over 300 of them, the object being to create the area of freedom, security and justice in Europe that we all need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Seriously, however, I would like to say the main concern within the competence of the European Union as regards pensioners relates to the sustainability of pensions systems in the different countries of the European Union. There are calls for this to be the first area to be tackled. In fact, the reports on the condition of the economy in the various Member States are systematically taking account of this issue in analysing the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is appropriate to consider the level of cover and the levels of balance and sustainability in pension systems, in addition to the debt, deficit or growth. As the honourable Member will be aware, a number of Member States of the Union are introducing changes to ensure pensions systems stand the test of time. That is what needs to be assured first of all.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the ageing of Europe’s population. Provision has been made for this in a range of policies. Ageing does not appear separately because when presenting priorities, one inevitably condenses the actions proposed into a few points. Ageing is certainly taken into account in connection with the quality of health care, means of transport, or facilities for those with impaired mobility. That stands to reason. These are just some examples of the types of policies involved. After all, quite apart from the debate on pensions, the aim has to be to ensure that older people are fully integrated into the wider society. They must never be sidelined or discriminated against. On the contrary, they must always be at the forefront of our minds, and we should strive to ensure they are fully integrated and included. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On external actions, I noted that the Commissioner mentioned Iraq but did not mention Afghanistan. The European Union has done a lot in Afghanistan; we have committed and spent money faster than ever before in keeping our promises. I am worried about the security situation in Afghanistan, however. The money might just as well have been thrown down the drain if the situation reverts to where it was a couple of years ago under the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">The same situation applies to Iraq. Unless the security situation is secured, we are putting money from the poorest people in the world into an area which is quite rich. I feel that there is some measure of caution that we need to exercise in whatever we do in Iraq, unless the security situation confirms that the funds we give for cooperation and development are secured and that we are not wasting the money because the situation becomes unstable and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point of the Lisbon Agenda, I should like to ask the Commissioner to look back at the record of the Conservative Party: in 1977 my country was considered the sick man of Europe; my party got into power under Margaret Thatcher and we are today one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.

Much remains to be done in that regard in the wider world, however. Hopefully, the gains made will be consolidated and built upon. That is what I am hoping for from the incoming Commission. Nonetheless, it is true that a glance at the ten new candidatures reveals a degree of imbalance. That is just too bad. What we need to do is work with the situation as it is, not simply talk of quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the concern expressed by the honourable Member. The fact that there is no specific mention of Afghanistan certainly does not mean that action in that country will not be maintained. Commitments were made to Afghanistan and will obviously be honoured. What is currently at issue is the Union’s contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq. The honourable Member is of course right to say that the situation in those two countries is completely different. The opportunities open to Iraq are not the same as those available to Afghanistan. The latter is a much poorer country. It has far less potential and natural resources of its own. Once Iraq’s infrastructure is back in place and the country’s potential can be released, its future should look more hopeful. I am sure we all hope this will very soon be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the Lisbon Agenda, you are quite right, ladies and gentlemen. There is no need to keep on reinventing the wheel. I fully agree with the honourable Member that what has to be done is implement the agreements reached at Lisbon. The Lisbon reforms must be carried through, implemented and developed in all Member States of the Union. That is the way to ensure the economy becomes more competitive. Next year’s mid-term review will of course reveal, amongst other things, whether activity at Community level has been in line with the objectives set.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of areas I am very familiar with, like transport and energy, I do believe everything that should have been done has been done. Only a few issues remain under negotiation between Parliament and the Council. I think the same is true of other areas too.</p>
<p class="contents">There certainly are some outstanding items. The main shortcoming, however, is the failure of Member States of the Union to implement structural measures. Progress has been very uneven in this regard. Some countries have forged ahead. Others are still experiencing problems. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the situation will soon improve, as all are aware of the need to act. A number of Prime Ministers, Heads of State and Presidents are on record as having made statements to that effect. The European Union sorely needs these reforms. I trust they will be given new impetus and implemented at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This takes neo-liberal, federal and military development yet another step further.</p>
<p class="contents">The main axes place competitiveness ahead of cohesion, security ahead of citizenship and ‘foreign responsibilities’ – both civil and military – ahead of cooperation. This at a time when the financial context is increasingly restrictive, when new reductions are envisaged in the size of the budget and when a policy of spending cuts and redistribution is pursued in order to fund these priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The first axis – the economic one – obliges us to comply with the objectives of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’, specifically with the (liberalisation of) services Directive, which proposes to use the financial services markets as a template for the ‘defence market’ and to create a ‘research’ space aimed at commercialising scientific and technical progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The second axis – security – suggests that we should put in place border management and create a police force, in order to control migratory flows, in line with the interests of employers, and in so doing strengthen the trend towards security in the name of combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The third axis – external affairs – is concerned with ‘defence’ and places emphasis on creating a free trade area in Europe and the Mediterranean, thus turning the EU into a regional power.</p>
<p class="contents">We oppose this project. A different Europe is possible and necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
