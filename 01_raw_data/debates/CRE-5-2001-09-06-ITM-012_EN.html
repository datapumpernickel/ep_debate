<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ebner (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming has arrived on the European Parliament's agenda in the run up to the International Year of Mountains in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Activities have therefore been planned over the coming year at international, national and local level to promote the sustainable development of mountain regions. The main objectives of the International Year of Mountains are to create awareness and increase knowledge about mountain ecosystems and their dynamics and operation, to promote and maintain the cultural heritage of mountain communities and the maintenance and sustainable development of resources in mountain regions to safeguard the quality of life of the population now and in the future. Finally, mountain regions account for about 30% of the land area and 20% of the utilised agricultural area in the European Union and 10% of the population of the EU live there.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the European Union should also use the coming International Year of Mountains as an opportunity to express the specific concerns of mountain regions and recognise mountain regions as indispensable habitats. At the same time, the quality of life in mountain regions must be maintained and protected and the constant threat of exodus must be stopped. This report is also, by definition, the European Parliament's position on the International Year of Mountains and should be seen by the Commission and the Council as our basic wish list.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically I call in this report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a comprehensive EU strategy for mountain regions. The report contains numerous new and, to my mind, practical proposals which I call on you to support during the coming vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is thus called on, first, to submit a communication this year setting out EU actions in connection with the International Year of Mountains. I think this communication should contain a comprehensive concept for the regions in question with regard to the period after 2006 and with regard to enlargement. This will, of necessity, include revising Directive 268/75 and subsequent amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like to clarify that the overall concept needed must take account of the principle of subsidiarity. Despite what are often similar problems and difficulties, it is a fact that even mountain regions differ in their individual characteristics, meaning that there is no universal patent solution. Common problems can be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach.</p>
<p class="contents">My report therefore advocates an approach which takes equal account of the following areas: farming and forestry, transport, tourism, energy and water, regional planning, nature conservation and the maintenance of the common cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a few words on individual demands set out in the report. Agriculture: basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy, the development of rural areas, to be extended, taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to find common problem-solving strategies in the form of regional conventions, set and update criteria and data on mountain areas and fund practical, mountain-related projects under the sixth framework programme, extend the basic infrastructure needed and provide training and further training so that the population keeps abreast of events and strengthen transport networks in mountain regions, taking account of the principle of sustainability, in order to safeguard these regions as habitats and economic areas and nature areas. This means, for example, that access roads to farms and alpine pastures must be guaranteed, while bigger roads must comply with criteria of strict eco-compatibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, last but not least, mountain regions need special treatment in the run up to enlargement. The forthcoming International Year of Mountains is an ideal time, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the specifics of tomorrow's proposal. You, ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my report, and more importantly you, Commissioner, and the Commission, by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start by thanking Mr Ebner for his own initiative report. This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support. Given that, as Mr Ebner has just said, mountain regions account for around 30% of the land area in the EU, while in many Member States, such as Austria, they account for as much as 50%, I welcome and support this own initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage. The maintenance and sustainable management of resources is very important in numerous regions of Europe. The protection of mountain regions, forests, water, the ecological balance and biodiversity needs to be set out in an overall European concept. Many mountains straddle frontiers. Many problems can only be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach and by joining forces. I must stress that farming and forestry have a multifunctional role in mountain regions and that this will be hugely important in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the people who live in the mountains and the tourists who visit every year looking for rest and relaxation value this unique natural and cultural landscape, which is why we must create appropriate incentives for people to live and work there. We must take precautions to prevent the ecological and socio-economic consequences of exodus and depopulation. Sustainable cultivation by mountain farmers not only provides quality food, it also renders a huge service to mankind as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations have rightly proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains. I think it is important for Europe to take a stance now and for the Commission to present a communication as quickly as possible, setting out a really clear definition, taking account of criteria such as altitude, gradient and the vegetation which has been cut down so that we can really address the various problems throughout Europe, and proposing appropriate concepts for strategies and development mechanisms.</p>

<p class="contents">However, amongst its many and, I believe, very valuable, proposals, I would like to draw your attention to certain issues which, on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming, should receive very special, and in some cases new, attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring, firstly, to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming. For them, a new approach is required today which is very different from their obsolete marginalisation within the traditional CAP. This proposal appears in section 19 of the Ebner report, but if we want to do it well, Mr Fischler, coordinated approach is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the new agriculture of the mountain regions, women currently play many important roles, both in relation to agriculture and in relation to tourism, rural development, rural tourism, new technologies and in relation to craft-industry, commercial and economic policies. I hope you understand, Commissioner, that their potential could be enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the proposal contained in section 22, which also relates to another of today’s pressing problems, that of migration policies. It is proposed that mountain regions where population is decreasing could serve as reception areas for absorbing immigrants, given suitable socio-economic planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that compensation measures should be taken to prevent mountain regions receiving less structural aid than they receive at the moment as a result of enlargement. This must be prevented, because enlargement must not under any circumstances have a negative impact on these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think that small and medium-sized farms should be promoted by means of a modulation of aid that stimulates employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that if you really want to provide new impetus and a new strategy for mountain farming, you will take these proposals into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report speaks for itself: it is complete and exhaustive and also has the merit of setting mountain farming in a wider and more general context of mountain problems. I think this approach is the right one for achieving a genuine European policy in 2002: International Year of Mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 does mention mountain farming, but everything gets more complicated at the implementation stage, for instance when Italian regions give notification of intervention laws for mountain areas, for example on animal husbandry or indeed on natural disasters which have already occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, your ‘Agriculture’ Directorate is turning into a worthy and legitimate control body. It is beginning a long correspondence made up of requests for minute details. It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in, frequently stamped on the closing date, sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Sooner or later, especially in the Alpine areas of the Union – lucky Switzerland takes care of its mountains without this network of controls – this could lead to an anti-European backlash. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, to publicise the principles of this report on agriculture and remember, not just occasionally, that the Union has signed the Agriculture Protocol of the Alpine Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good report. Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location. Your report also has a drawback, however. It only focuses on this aspect. It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it – although they do, after all, represent the majorities – can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings. It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity. However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it. We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, the trend is towards greater liberalisation of agricultural production and the concentration of land and production in the hands of fewer and fewer people, with the result that mountain regions are sinking faster and faster into economic and social stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">All that the proposal to offset the reduction in Community support for these regions by applying national and regional measures means in practice is that the European Union will completely abandon mountain regions and will attempt to shift even the miserable and ineffective support of the last 25 years on to its Member States. This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece, which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget, with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds. In addition, this sort of proposal recommends nationalising the financing for policies formulated by the European Union, meaning that the poorest countries will be forced to apply anti-farming Community policy without any compensation or support measures and pay for it out of their own pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal to reject the removal of the milk quota system in mountain regions on the grounds of reduced competitiveness and high production costs is proof of the total lack of any social criteria and the annoying hypocrisy of the European Union's environmentally-friendly pronouncements, given that the same restrictive measures are being applied to mountain and industrial livestock farming, while we all know the differences between them as regards both the environment and public health. What with grim neo-liberal criteria and the profit and competition argument, mountain regions are condemned to stagnation and abandonment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report, because we believe that the specific measures proposed, operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse, they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions, with huge economic, social and environmental consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep. It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission. You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life. Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins. Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities. It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas. It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush’s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter, more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect. We have to consider too that we will have a conflict. Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to.</p>
<p class="contents">In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars, two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances. All the utilities are over-utilised while in other areas we are closing down public services. Roads are under-utilised, we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made. We should not abandon vast areas of our countries, where human activity will fade away. These mountains will not be attractive if there are no villages, if there are no variable scenes of farms and livestock and people living there. They will not provide the tourist amenities we need in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we allow this to happen, it will be like what we did in my country 50 years ago when we closed down our railways. We will regret it in 40 or 50 years from now. If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed. I was in Scotland during the summer and I have seen the extent to which the Highlands have been denuded of their population. Britain is much the poorer for that. If we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a Europe that will be much poorer. We should return to this subject later and make firm proposals for the budgetary resources that we, as a Union, could use towards this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We represent only a little over 5% of the inhabitants of Europe, of European citizens, but, as documented in the annals of the European Parliament over fifty years of the European Union, this is only the third time that the word ‘mountain’ and a motion for a resolution about mountains have been heard in this Chamber. The first time was in 1983. The rapporteur then was Mr Colleselli, from Cadore, in the North of Italy. The second time, fifteen years later, I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House, with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions, approved on 23 October 1998. My report started from an overall view of the problems of mountain regions, in all their complexity, and concluded that mountain farming was and remains the key.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ebner report – and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it – takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon. I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are all aware, once again, that farming cannot do it alone. That is why there are also proposals in Mr Ebner’s report which involve the whole mountain world: transport, infrastructure, tourism, the eco-system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another factor we must protect and safeguard; the vital factor for the mountains, Commissioner, is and remains man. The average age of farmers in Europe – as you know –is about 50. Some mountain farmers are over 60. That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make mountain farming attractive again, give the farmers confidence, and give them resources. Above all we must have the courage to recognise, Commissioner, that a specific type of farming called mountain farming exists. Let us do so with conviction so that the mountains themselves can continue to exist! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission has always seen hill and mountain farming as a very important and highly interesting subject. I should like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, more importantly, the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for this own initiative report on 25 years’ application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with the 1998 Santini report on a new strategy for hill and mountain farming and with the International Year of Mountains coming up next year, the Ebner report highlights the importance of mountain regions to the European Union. In particular, it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots, produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage. It also points out that the viability of the countryside in mountain regions goes far beyond agriculture and depends on a multitude of factors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from this starting premise that the same questions preoccupy us. Multifunctionality is also the cornerstone of our new rural development policy. It aims to promote farming in which all functions and services are recognised, every function which farmers offer our society.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an integral part of the European farming model and I can assure you, in response to a number of concerns expressed in the report, that the Commission will stand squarely behind the need to take account of this aspect during trade negotiations at the World Trade Association.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement impending, the report calls on the Commission to create a global strategy for mountain regions and hill and mountain farming both in the Member States and in the candidate countries. On this point, I must say, the Commission approach differs from the approach taken in the report. May I remind you that the new rural development policy only started up last year. We placed subsidiarity right at the forefront of this new policy, so that the Member States could set their own priorities and include what they consider are the most suitable measures for making the best of their regions and dealing with local drawbacks or difficulties in their rural development plans or Structural Fund planning documents.</p>
<p class="contents">This decentralised approach, which also applies to the SAPARD programmes, means that the rural development programme can be properly tailored to mountain regions and can accommodate the differences between them. For example, the Pyrenees need different concepts from the Alps. This fosters sustainable development which takes account both of socio-economic problems and the environmental challenges facing each of these regions. Instead of laying down central guidelines, as was recently the case, we should be discussing how best to implement the mountain region policy in detail not just with all the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities but also with our economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and scientific circles.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out, <span class="italic">à propos</span>, that the Commission accepted the second report on economic and social cohesion on 31 January this year. This report raises the question of setting priorities for the balanced and sustained development of the regions in an enlarged Union and the question of covering increased cohesion requirements, to mention just two, and calls for discussion on the subject. This report offers numerous opportunities to develop regions lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the Commission's contribution to the International Year of Mountains, therefore, is to advertise our current development mechanisms more widely. The Commission will organise a seminar in the second half of the year at Commissioner Barnier's and my initiative, the purpose of which will be to present and advertise the opportunities which Community policy offers mountain regions. You and any other interested parties are also invited to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the report, I should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments, which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions, and through environmental measures, through aid for forestry, through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid, for example in the tourism sector. I should also like to remind you, Mrs Rojo, that the instructions for drawing up rural development programmes state that express reference must be made to programmes specifically for women and that each of the rural development programmes must contain a chapter describing specific help for women.</p>
<p class="contents">The same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market. These too take account of the specific nature of extensive farming, especially in mountain regions, either through specific, customised measures such as beef extensification premiums or premiums for sheepmeat or goatmeat production or by giving the Member States additional room to manoeuvre by allowing them to give special support to regions of their choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will address special treatment for farmers in mountain regions in relation to milk quotas, as proposed in the report, as part of its midterm review. Finally, we should not forget, with reference to the Structural Funds, that 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2. These mountain regions can all apply under current support rules and the Member States can tailor the measures needed to individual demands, be it in relation to transport or telecommunications networks, basic public services or support for economic activities. In principle, this can be complemented by national aid, as Mr Caveri mentioned. Here too, however, the golden rule is that we continue to require notification a) because this gives regions the security of knowing that their measures will be seen to be compatible with EU law and b) because we must not allow unfair competition between individual regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot address all the suggestions in the report, but I hope that the seminar organised by the Commission to coincide with the International Year of Mountains will give plenty of opportunity to come back to these suggestions. In the meantime, the Commission will exercise its powers and right of initiative in order to examine the conclusions of the report in greater detail and continue the dialogue started today. I am positive that this will allow us to successfully raise the profile of mountain regions and highlight their importance to Europe.</p>
