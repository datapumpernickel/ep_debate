<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am pleased to be here to set out the Commission’s intentions on the services proposal. I have taken note of the reports referring to a possible withdrawal of the proposal by the Commission. I can confirm to you that the Commission has no intention of withdrawing the proposal currently on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on my consultations and having listened carefully to all sides of the argument, I identified a number of areas where I believe changes would be required for the broad consensus I would like to see emerge. Many of you have urged me to clarify the Commission’s position on these points in the interest of facilitating Parliament’s own deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">Members may recall that during my hearing before the European Parliament, I promised to consult and listen carefully before making any pronouncements on the draft directive, which the previous Commission brought forward. Since then I have been meeting extensively with MEPs, social partners and ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I was heartened by the degree of support there is across the political spectrum for opening the services market. If we want to achieve the levels of growth necessary for sustainable development then a vibrant services sector is a prerequisite. Yet, the single market in services is often still a distant ambition, rather than a reality. If we are to let our economies develop and grow we must maintain a clear focus on the services market.</p>
<p class="contents">The services directive is a key element in our efforts to relaunch the Lisbon Agenda. Getting the full benefit that services can bring to the EU economy will boost growth and jobs. If we are serious about the Lisbon Agenda, we must be serious about the services market.</p>
<p class="contents">After my initial round of contacts, I went to President Barroso and said that I believed the current proposal would never be adopted unless we were prepared to accept modifications. That is why in presenting the Commission’s views on the Lisbon Strategy to you some weeks ago, President Barroso indicated that the Commission believed some changes would be necessary to ensure success.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up the services market is an ambitious project. The proposal to achieve this is innovative. To be successful we need a broad consensus. There are aspects of the current draft that are giving rise to serious concerns. The debate had become too polarised. Many of you have raised such concerns and it is clear that shortcomings have to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to outline my views briefly to the Conference of Presidents last week and I am happy to discuss this further with you today. Let me reiterate the areas I have identified. The directive will have to be clear that conditions and standards for workers will not be affected in any way. The text will have to be watertight on this point. There will be no change to the existing situation in this regard. I do not want to hear any more talk about so-called 'social dumping'. This is not what this proposal is about and we should put an end to this confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area I have identified is the exclusion from the scope of the directive of sectors such as health and publicly funded services of general interest: for obvious reasons, people regard these sectors as particularly sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">We should address concerns about the operation of the country of origin principle. We need to maintain this if we want to promote the cross-frontier provision of services. To do so we will need to address key issues such as giving greater confidence and certainty to businesses and consumers on what law will apply to cross-border transactions. We also need to build the trust and confidence between Member States necessary for it to operate effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The above points reflect the principal areas emerging from my own consultations. It is of course up to you in Parliament to make your own decisions. Clearly, it is your responsibility to decide on the amendments you want to bring forward. On behalf of the Commission, I am merely signalling our willingness to work openly and constructively with you.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday at the Council of Ministers for Competitiveness there was an exchange of views on the services proposal. The presidency welcomed the clear statement that no new proposal would be presented by the Commission. It endorsed the suggestion that health and social services of general interest be excluded from the proposal. It agreed that the current text needed to be modified if it was to be adopted. I hope we can now move the discussion in the European Parliament and Council onto the positive elements that this proposal can bring.</p>
<p class="contents">Many aspects of the proposal have met with broad support and we should build on these. Removing the red tape currently strangling efforts to establish or provide services on a cross-border basis will make a real contribution to entrepreneurship, growth and job creation. Ensuring that companies have easy access to information on requirements they have to comply with will contribute to this, as will the simplification of authorisation procedures. Service providers and their customers and consumers should not see their desire to benefit from the single market frustrated by being subjected to discriminatory and disproportionate requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Recipients of services should also have easy access to information on service providers and their services. It should be easier to choose a service provider from another Member State. Quality of services should be guaranteed and simple access to dispute settlement must be available. We need to develop the cooperation, confidence and assistance between Member State administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the single market in services is about. It will increase competition, stimulate entrepreneurship and provide new opportunities for service providers, which will give a much-needed boost to the EU economy. By ensuring that we deliver on this we will give the services economy the boost it requires. We will fulfil the commitment set out in the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I am prepared to be constructive and positive. From the meetings I have had with many of you, I have learned a great deal and very useful and constructive suggestions have been made. I remain open and available to all of you to discuss particular ideas, concerns or proposals you may have.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with this I have outlined the Commission’s position and our desire to work loyally within the codecision process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission is grateful for this opportunity to make a statement on the proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. I have already had the opportunity to discuss the proposal with the Committee on Legal Affairs on 2 February and with the Conference of Presidents on 3 March. On both occasions I took very careful note of Parliament’s views. I noted that Parliament considers, in general, that its views were not given sufficient weight at first reading. From the debate in the Legal Affairs Committee, I noted that there are differing views on the substance of the proposal, in particular its content and purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission gave careful consideration to Parliament’s request of 24 February, submitted under Article 55 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. But the Commission concluded that at that stage, regrettably, it could not submit a new proposal as Parliament requested. That was not because the Commission wished to persist stubbornly with the proposal, but because the Council was on the point of adopting a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">As I explained to the Conference of Presidents, the Council reached a political agreement in May 2004 at first reading. The Council has been on the verge of confirming the political agreement in the form of a common position since December 2004. The Commission had supported the political agreement of May 2004. The Commission could not, therefore, go back on its word when the Council was in the process of confirming its common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has now made up its mind and adopted its common position. It did so yesterday at the Competitiveness Council. Jeannot Krecké, Chair of the Competitiveness Council, has already explained to the Legal Affairs Committee the reasons behind the Council’s stance. It confirmed its common position, primarily for institutional reasons. The Council wanted to avoid the setting of a precedent, with Member States being seen to back away from a deal they had signed up to in May 2004. The Council confirmed its position to show that a deal is a deal and that it was not creating a logjam in a key area for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, when the Council took its decision, Jeannot Krecké noted that some Member States had concerns about the substance of the text and that these would be addressed at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The ball is now very clearly in the European Parliament’s court. It is for you to decide how you want to play it. I do not have to remind you of Parliament’s rights: we discussed this in the Conference of Presidents. You can, of course, reject or substantially amend the proposal. If Parliament decides to reject it, then the Commission will respect your wishes. I will not propose a new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Should you decide to propose amendments, the Commission will give them due consideration. No doubt improvements can be made. You will understand, of course, that I cannot speak on behalf of the Council and I would urge Parliament to engage constructively with the Council on this subject in the future. I am ready to help in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I would like to say a few words on the substance of the proposal, since Parliament will now need to turn its attention to this. The Commission proposed to clarify the legal rules on patentability for software-related inventions. This does not include computer programs or other software as such. It means inventions that make a technical contribution and that are truly novel. Such inventions are present in a number of everyday consumer goods such as cars, mobile telephones and domestic appliances. The Commission’s intention in making its proposal was to avoid the patenting of pure software and make a clear distinction between the European Union and the United States. Nothing that is not patentable now will be made patentable by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The current rules in the European Patent Convention leave patent examiners very wide decision-making powers. There can be different interpretations as to whether an invention can be patented. This leads to uncertainty for businesses. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are negatively affected by the lack of clarity in the existing rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Members that, in the absence of a directive, patents will continue to be granted. If patent offices decide to grant patents for pure software, then expensive procedures before the Courts will be the only option for those who wish to object.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of you who have been directly involved in working on this proposal know as well as I do that this is a very complex area. Any modifications will need to be carefully examined. The directive cannot be turned on its head. We need to maintain a proper balance between stimulating innovation and making sure competition is not stifled.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have not spoken for too long. The situation is now clear. The ball is in your court. I am sure you will exercise your rights and your judgement wisely. Whatever you decide, I would like to reassure you that the Commission is listening. I know there is a new wind blowing. That is reflected in the positions expressed in the Council and Parliament and the Commission will take account of this and respect it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, it clearly comes as no surprise to you that the Left is strongly opposed to this particular directive and would prefer you to withdraw it, or at least neuter it. However, please do not assume that is the wish of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">A matter of hours ago we voted on the Figueiredo report. That report on the social situation in Europe was scathing about the Services Directive, and this House voted to reject it. I suggest that the message here is clear, and you may be surprised at the strength of feeling in support of what you aim to do, surprised at the awareness that this directive could be good for consumers, good for taxpayers, good for growth and above all good for jobs. I would therefore urge you, Commissioner, to be bold in your proposals and to press ahead.</p>

I would go so far as to say that we all, of course, want to construct an internal market, but this directive contains many tricky points. I am therefore delighted, Commissioner, that you have understood the criticism not only from my group, but also from across the entire spectrum of this House. I should nevertheless like a few additional clarifications, for – as my fellow Members have already pointed out – it is not always as clear how far you are willing to go with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two points to make, Commissioner. First of all, you claim that this directive’s scope is probably too wide and in your speaking notes for the Conference of Presidents you mention<span class="italic"> </span>public funded services of general interest. A moment ago, you mentioned only social services. Could you explain exactly what you mean? After all, services of general interest are far more comprehensive than just social services.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is not at all clear in which direction you would like to take the country of origin principle. Do you share our view that the country of origin principle can work only if there is a sufficient level of harmonisation and mutual recognition – if, in other words, there is a real basis for trust? Let me say, Commissioner, that I believe constructive cooperation to be a real option only if you more clearly clarify, for our benefit, exactly what you mean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr McCreevy, in one minute, I can only say this. Software is a language. Patenting software is exactly like giving people the opportunity to become the exclusive owners of the words or grammatical rules of a language and therefore prevent other people from using them. For example, it allows a company to become the sole owner of the common procedure of closing a file by clicking on the top right-hand corner of the image on the screen of a computer. It is absurd, software should be protected by author’s rights like every language.

<p class="contents">My question concerns the Services Directive. It is presumably still the Commission’s role to be guardian of the Treaties. Yet, this very day - 8 March, International Women’s Day - the Commission is removing the whole of the health sphere - that is to say, an area dominated by women - from the Services Directive. We know that, if there is more than one employer to choose between, there is a much greater chance of higher wages. In view of this, you will, then, be attempting to restrict women’s opportunities for obtaining higher wages, their having only one or very few potential employers. Obtaining higher wages and being able to have more than one potential employer are important objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do about this? Will the Commission present a new proposal in the health area? It is, in actual fact, the Commission’s role to grant the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty to <span class="italic">all</span> Europeans – women as well as men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that I am extremely annoyed about finding out that, unknown to Parliament, negotiations are being held with certain Member States or that, in the case of software, Parliament’s view is simply being ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the content. There has been much talk about the Lisbon strategy and the need for innovation and promoting the European services market. I am one of the advocates of the services directive, and it goes without saying that we need clarification and improvement on a number of points, provided this is based on facts and not based on media reports which are full of false information, or <span class="italic">tête-à-têtes</span> with Chirac, Schröder and others. As for the software, the quality of legislation must not be made subordinate to the power struggle between the institutions. The innovation that we need must not be stifled by misguided legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr McCreevy, I would argue in favour of paying more than lip service to the Lisbon strategy and also of respect for the democratic process and for the elected representatives of Europe’s people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore think it important to state that it is the most significant individual reform we now have for European integration and for giving new impetus to the Lisbon process. It is not only a Services Directive that we need, but a directive that provides increased trade in services across European borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The services sector corresponds to 70% of the European economy. We shall never obtain the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world if we do not open up the services sector. It is against that background that there are reasons for being concerned about what the Commissioner has said, because large parts of the services sector are exempt. It is important to analyse the issue: how much will be left of the European services sector subsequent to the exemptions now being granted?</p>
<p class="contents">For 50 years, half of Europe has had the advantage of living in freedom and peace and has been able to develop a services sector with a high knowledge content. We have that competitive advantage. Another part of Europe has other competitive advantages. How will the Commissioner guarantee that all European countries have competitive advantages through the country of origin principle and through a free and open trade in services? These are crucial issues if we are to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does this position actually comprise? If it is the dry text of 18 May, then there will not be a majority to back it even in the Council, for, at the end of the day, eight states have announced or delivered statements with critical comments on the directive’s central points, and four national parliaments have expressed their opposition to its content. How, then, will you take account of the objections these states have raised? It can, of course, be done in this House, but the Council is, after all, responsible for getting the backing of a majority, and that is what the post-18 May text will not get in its present form. No attempt has as yet been made to take on board the Member States’ objections.

<p class="contents">I refer to both questions, services and software. With particular regard to software, the decision taken yesterday is a serious affront to the democratic wishes of European citizens.

<p class="contents">I believe the directive lacks a clear legal framework and runs the risk of allowing the large IT multinationals to patent not only the software used in industrial applications but also other types of computer program, thereby seriously restricting the use of technological innovations in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be clearly understood that this method of interinstitutional cooperation, which ignores the views of the European Parliament, the only institution elected democratically by universal suffrage, is not democratic and does not represent the wishes expressed by millions of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The criticism has been listened to. A few things are, however, unclear, for example concerning the labour market. Do you share my view that it is not enough to grant exemptions through the Directive on the posting of workers? Instead, the whole of the labour market should be exempted, in which case the host country principle should apply, should it not?</p>
<p class="contents">If, now, the labour market is exempted and the host country principle applies to environmental standards, consumer law and so on, then I wonder, secondly, how, in drafting a directive, it can be thought that the basic principle should be the country of origin principle. Perhaps it is the most important areas in which, instead, the host country principle should apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question I should like to put concerns services of general interest. I think it good that health and health care, together with social services, are to be exempt.

<p class="contents">First and foremost, clarification must be given as regards which services it applies to. You have just said that health services should remain outside it and I believe that there are health services that should be subject to market forces and that service providers from any of the Member States should compete for those services. Yet I also believe that if services of general interest were to remain outside, we would have to define what those services are. Is the Commission prepared to table a framework-law, in time, which could be taken into account when we look into the directive?</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect to mention is that of country of origin. This obviously must be changed. It can be applied to company constitutions and to the beginning of operations, but as a basic principle it must be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there are fundamental changes to be made, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, if it would not be better to withdraw this directive in its current form, and for the Commission, as the author of these initiatives, to table a more appropriate proposal to serve the Union’s interests effectively? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I indicated very early on that I wanted to speak; yet, with respect to my French colleagues, you took almost a dozen French contributions and none from Members from other countries. I think you should be more balanced and should observe the order that people indicate. I know I indicated that I wished to speak before other colleagues who spoke – good luck to them. But you should watch and be fair, Mr President. Fair play is all we ask.</p>

If Parliament wishes to reject it, then the Commission will respect that decision. I have heard what Members are saying on that matter. I said it in the committee meeting I attended. I repeated it at the Council presidency last week and I repeat it here today in my speech. It is up to the European Parliament to do its job on this particular matter and we will take on board your concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Some questions were asked about the matter at the Council of Ministers yesterday. The Council of Ministers issued a statement and it is now a matter for the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the services directive. One thing I have learned in my political life is that it is always easier to come up with reasons not to do something than it is to do something. Secondly, I believe that there is never a right time to take a new or brave initiative. There are always good reasons not do anything. May I also say that it is easier for ministers or Commissioners to sit in their offices and say that they will do absolutely nothing, because the only way to avoid making bad decisions is to make no decisions! But we in Europe do not have the option of sitting on our hands and praying and hoping that something will turn up, as in Beckett’s novel. We have to do something to galvanise the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I respect the views of people on the left and on the right. I respect the political philosophy of people who have looked at things differently from me over the years. I respect the different economic philosophies that can be pursued with legitimacy. I have my own particular ideas in that regard. But no matter where you stand on this particular problem regarding the European economy, you have to conclude that standing still is not an option.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And if 70% of the European Union’s economy comes from services, you do not need a higher degree in economics to realise that you must do something about services in Europe in order to galvanise the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of years, the European economy has been growing at a rate less than its full potential. That will not allow us to sustain the social model that we have built up, or to have sustainable development, unless we do something dramatic to galvanise economic activity in the Union. Whatever perspective you take, if we keep heading in the present direction we will not be able to do the things we have taken for granted for many decades. Nor will we be able to do things in the future, such as dealing with our ageing populations, unless we do something about the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The services directive, as proposed by the previous Commission, was a noble and very innovative attempt to do something dramatic in this vital area. I could take a pristine, pure view of this – as some Commission officials might want – and stand in my office on the ninth floor of the Berlaymont, open the window, get a trumpet and broadcast that ‘this is wonderful! I am going to stand on the barricades for ever and ever and defend this proposal from the last Commission! It is absolutely brilliant and I am going to defend it from now until death – and into the Valley of Death I would ride!’ However, I realise that the services directive as initiated has not a snowball’s chance in hell of getting through either the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament. I could be pristine and pure and say that I will make great speeches about it, get nothing through, offer no services directive at all and do nothing to address the problems facing us all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have taken the pragmatic view. I have listened to what parliamentarians have to say. I have been here on <span class="italic">many</span> occasions. I have met people individually and collectively and at committees and they have given me very good ideas as to what we should do. Some people strongly believe we should continue as we started, but that will not succeed either. Therefore, I have taken everybody’s views into account and have stated that the Commission is willing to listen and to accept changes to ensure that we will end up with a services directive that does something positive for the European economy. That is why I am here today, and that is what I set forth here this afternoon and last week.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very important point I must say that the members of any organisation – be it a local political party, a local sports club, a local trade union or a local employers’ organisation – all like certainty and do not like change. We always like change for the other person but not for ourselves. Politicians are the same. We would prefer not to have to face another election but just be elected time after time. That would be great for the politician, but very bad for democracy. Therefore, we do not want to create the impression that we are going to deny the new Member States that recently joined the Union the same opportunities that the existing 15 have had for a long time, including the country I know best.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I respect the views of people who look at this problem from a different perspective. However, we cannot be here just as the voice of the ‘ins’ and forget about the ‘outs’. That is not what social democracy, as I know it, is meant to be. We must guard against people who are lulled into defending the interests of the status quo. It is the easier political thing to do, because they are the people you are certain of and who probably voted for you before. However, remember that there are millions of people coming on to the job market who are waiting for the opportunity to have a decent standard of living and social inclusion. They must be given the same opportunity as the rest of us have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we come up with a services directive that makes a positive economic impact and takes on board genuine concerns. I am prepared to take those on board and to work with the European Parliament on getting a services directive through. It is now for the European Parliament to deal with the matter. I will be as constructive as possible. I hope to be able to come up with the best solution possible, based on the broadest consensus, because that is what we and Europe need.</p>
