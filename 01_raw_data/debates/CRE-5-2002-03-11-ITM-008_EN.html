Article 286 of the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated that this would happen as of 1999. We are behind schedule and we must therefore avoid further delays. I am glad to say that European Parliament and Council Regulation No 45/2001 was adopted at first reading following intense combined endeavours, and it set out the principles and rules, in line with those laid down by Community directives for the Member States, for the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation also set up an independent supervisory authority in the shape of the European Data Protection Supervisor, to be assisted by an Assistant Supervisor, who will oversee the implementation of the regulation. It established their roles and responsibilities – inquiries, advice and consultancy, regulation, settlement of disputes – and the procedures for their appointment. Only two points were not fixed by the regulation and are still to be settled: the remuneration to be paid to the Supervisor and his Assistant, and where the office will be located.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of remuneration, since the full independence of the Supervisor's office is to be guaranteed in respect of his function of monitoring all the Community institutions and bodies, it appears quite correct to propose that the Supervisor should receive the same remuneration as the Ombudsman or a judge at the European Court of Justice. In the case of the Assistant Supervisor, who will be appointed by the same procedure and for the same period as the Supervisor, and will have the additional responsibility of deputising for the Supervisor should the latter be absent or prevented from carrying out his duties, it is proposed that the remuneration payable should be the same as that of the Registrar of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the location of the office, as the majority of the personal data processing services of the Community institutions and bodies are located in Brussels, it is proposed that the Supervisor's office should also be located there.</p>
<p class="contents">After the debate in committee, a number of amendments were adopted which I do not endorse, such as those raising doubts about financial coverage, which have since become obsolete following the adoption of the budget. Other amendments, however, refer to the adoption of another major regulation, Regulation No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Since these amendments introduce recitals and not additional provisions, which would be unacceptable due to the lack of a legal base, I feel I can support them. The adoption during the course of the same year of these two major regulations confirms that, in Europe, the culture of personal data protection and the culture of the transparency of public activities are developing alongside each other rather than conflicting. Both are in opposition, however, to the authoritarian, bureaucratic culture which, on the one hand, fails to respect the privacy of individual citizens, and, on the other, has the gall to keep the administrative procedures and activities of public bodies confidential.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the adoption of this decision will fill a significant gap in the system protecting the European citizens’ fundamental right to the protection of personal data, which is now enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Officially, we are assessing the statute of the European data protection Supervisor here, and there are some observations to be made in this respect, which I will do in a moment. However, many of us actually want to discuss the brief and working method of the Supervisor but, as already stated, this decision has already been made, and I fear that we simply suffered from a collective lapse of concentration when that happened. We are now lumbered with a body which employs fifteen people and which is assisted by another twenty people who work internally in the different institutions. This is quite a significant number, considering that this body only supervises the EU’s data which the European Union has at its disposal for the first pillar. For precisely those sensitive areas which one would expect to generate a great deal of work, such as Europol and Schengen, do not fall within the remit of this Supervisor. I therefore seriously wonder what all these people, 35 in total, will be doing all day, whether creating this bureaucratic employment will promote employment, transparency and openness towards the citizens, and also how cooperation with the Ombudsman will work. In my view, there is a real risk that a kind of rivalry will exist between the Ombudsman and this Supervisor, because their tasks overlap. Furthermore, what is the purpose of using tax money to set up a new separate institution which caters for such a restricted set of tasks? However, as already stated, we can only talk about the statute of the Supervisor and his assistant today, a role which I also question. In my view, the fact that a Supervisor is accorded the same status as the Ombudsman is neither here nor there, but to give his assistant the same special status is both costly and difficult to justify. The assistant simply belongs in the organisational chart. The Commission has underlined the analogy with the Ombudsman at every opportunity, but the Ombudsman has no assistant and has no other official who will be paid as handsomely as the assistant to this Supervisor. Since, of course, the Ombudsman and Supervisor will subsequently need to be independent, the official positions will simply need to fall within the remit of the budgetary authorities and not be laid down in a statute. I hope that we can at least get this right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that it is rather disappointing that the two opinions from the committees have been largely ignored in the Committee of Citizens' Freedoms. It is important that we say here and now that the mere fact that we strongly approve of the principles of protecting data and that we want to move forward, and also the fact that this needs to be done quickly, does not absolve us from the job of scrutinising this proposal properly. Normally, as he knows, I am very supportive of what Mr Bolkestein does, but in this case I do not feel that the Commission has in any way justified to us the salary and status of the staff that it proposes to administer this work. I very much echo what Mrs Buitenweg has said.</p>
<p class="contents">If this goes through as proposed, to carry out the task that we have set down here, we will be appointing someone who is substantially higher graded and better paid than someone running a major Community institution such as the Trade Mark Protection Office in Alicante – a major autonomous institution. As Mrs Buitenweg said, we do not yet know how many staff will be engaged in this process. I asked the Commission to give me more details about the establishment, the organisation, and the responsibilities and particularly the role of the assistant. Yet the Commission is proposing that we should appoint an assistant on the basis of someone who manages 1 000 staff in the European Court of Justice – now that does not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I have to say to Mr Bolkestein, if this goes through tomorrow – and I hope that we will actually have the opportunity to discuss in more detail and look at some amendments that you will accept – the fact we have come in at the end of the process has made it very difficult for those of us who want change to put forward acceptable amendments. If this goes through, you will have got off pretty lightly and I hope you will give us assurances, firstly that you will properly justify this grade and position, and secondly, that we will be scrutinising every move you make when you put it in place, to make sure that it is done properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has spoken very clearly and I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein has listened carefully to what he had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this, however, from a slightly different tack. The position of the Data Protection Supervisor is of enormous importance. The Charter of Fundamental Rights which I helped to prepare states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her and the Amsterdam Treaty called for the establishment of an independent supervisor by 1 January, 1999. This deadline is, of course, well past and our main priority, therefore, is to create this post as soon as we possibly can. The urgency of the matter should not in itself be an excuse for us to rush it through without proper discussion. Indeed, the salary of both the Data Protection Supervisor and his assistant has resulted in numerous discussions within our committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people, myself included, were unhappy about the unreasonably high salary of the supervisor, which will of course be comparable to that of the Ombudsman. But I contrast this discussion with the kind which one might have in a national parliament where, frankly, the issue itself is of such dramatic importance to the establishment of this role that it ought perhaps to be dealt with not in this particular plenary but elsewhere. We are not as flexible as I would like. Most of the matters relating to the post have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and published in the Official Journal. I know that the Secretariat has also declared a number of the amendments to be out of order for various reasons and this has caused concern among many colleagues. Internal politics has also been a feature of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate, that there is no single data protection instrument for all the pillars. As a member of the Future of Europe Convention, I do hope, indeed I might even anticipate, that at the conclusion of the work that we shall be doing, it may well be that the protection of the private citizen and the interests of the private citizen, both in terms of the work of the Ombudsman – which I highly value and respect – and also in connection with data protection issues, will be spelled out very clearly as something in need of development in the future. I hope, therefore, that whatever we decide – and I do hope that we decide to proceed with this post when we vote on this week – we will return to the matter and at an appropriate moment, perhaps, during discussion of the next Treaty or before then, we will look at ways of endorsing the position of citizens and making sure their relationship with institutions in Europe is a properly balanced one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is he who creates public trust in the institutions of the European Union. He must work where the majority of the institutions are permanently based, that is, in Brussels – if that is the point at issue. If he works elsewhere, the impression is created that he is of only negligible significance. If the public get the impression that the Data Protection Supervisor is nothing more than a paper tiger, they will not trust the European Union. If they have no confidence in the way their data is protected, our internal affairs policy will never enjoy the public approval it needs for freedom, security and justice to be allowed to grow. That, though, is our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We want internal affairs policy to have a European added value, which will be achieved only if the citizens put their trust in us. It is for that reason that we, and, in particular, the Commission, must show them that we take data protection seriously and that it is not in a merely symbolic sense that we are putting it centre stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are surprised at how much in terms of resources it is proposed should be allocated to this area, compared with how much the Commission has invested in turning the regulation on transparency into a reality. It is the lack of balance that surprises us.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the way in which the Commission interprets the regulation on transparency also surprises us. Parliament and the Commission do of course disagree about the Bavarian Lager case and about the way in which the Commission interprets the concept of data protection in that instance. That is why this issue is so difficult. As a Scandinavian citizen, I am also very disappointed at the fact that the Commission never refers to the supplementary clause, incorporated into Directive 95/46/EC on Sweden’s initiative and stating that account must always be taken of the public when processing personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say to some of the participating MEPs here that there are forces in Sweden which believe that the law concerning personal data should be repealed. I myself have also had experience of not being able to obtain information from the Commission in terms specifically of the law on personal data when I wanted to know who had complained about my country to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also quote what our legal adviser said about why it may not perhaps be possible to publish the list of assistants, legal advisers and members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Net. The reason was as follows:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(the speaker continued in French)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is a Regulation No 45/2001 relating to the protection of personal data. It is doubtless possible to be called before the judge by the European Data Protection Supervisor who has very wide powers, greater even than those of the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(the speaker continued in Swedish)</span></p>
<p class="contents">These are the facts. I hope that we shall support transparency and that, here in Parliament, we shall at least be able to question those proposed for the office in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I still feel that we, as elected members of Parliament, should be the primary ombudsmen of the people of Europe. Why do we need a Data Protection Supervisor? My esteemed fellow MEP, Timothy Kirkhope, justified it on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and by reference to data protection's significance. I do not believe that one can argue in this way, as we would next need a family ombudsman, a women's ombudsman and a children's ombudsman as well. All these groups have an important place in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In Schleswig-Holstein, the province of the Federal Republic of Germany from which I come, we have developed a veritable abomination; we even have a bicycle ombudsman. Anyone, though, who believes that cyclists come off better out of this, even in the planning of the budget, is, as we say, barking up the wrong tree. No, data protection really is important, and the reason why it is so to us is that we parliamentarians find monitoring difficult – even the monitoring of the Commission, and especially of what goes on within it – and so, of course, we need an auxiliary person in this field. He or she, as Mr Ceyhun rightly said, must be based in Brussels, where he or she is to carry on the work of monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to remuneration. No matter how important the position may be, I really cannot see that an ombudsman, who is to monitor this data, should, in salary terms, be on the same footing as a judge at the European Court of Justice. Why that should be the case completely eludes me. A judge at the Court of Justice occupies a significantly superior and more important position. The judges are, in any case, the guardians of our treaties. Why, then, should we pay a data protection supervisor as much as a judge at the ECJ? I think that in this respect our yardsticks of value have shifted a bit over the years, and they need to be put back in order. We should rather think about bringing the Ombudsman back to the right pay level instead of going straight ahead with allocating too much to the next position. On this point, I appeal for a bit more of a sense of reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the idea of striking a balance between them on a case-by-case basis whenever a name is mentioned misrepresents the nature both of dealing with openness in the public sector and the right to privacy. The principle of openness means that public bodies should take decisions as openly as possible and is now defined in the public access regulation. That regulation provides for exceptions to access. The point of this exception is that a public body may, in carrying out its public duties, come into possession of information about the private and family life of individuals. However, there is nothing in Article 286 of the EC Treaty or in the Data Protection Directive to suggest that data protection rules should be applied as a general principle of confidentiality in public administrations so as to require a public balancing exercise whenever a document mentions a name. Such an over-interpretation would damage not only the right of public access to documents, but also the genuine purpose of data protection and the performance of the duties of the Data Protection Supervisor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is no effective, independent supervision of the ways in which legislation is formulated and applied, people are in danger of having their human rights infringed in terms of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – the right to respect for private and family life, as well as to the protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more people handle ever greater quantities of sensitive personal information. The amount of such information will expand further, especially when Schengen has been fully integrated into Community legislation. Other sensitive information, of a kind as yet unknown, may be anticipated in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The first EU country to introduce effective data protection was, interestingly enough, the country with the most far-reaching rules when it comes to openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is to be possible to introduce a strong and generally applicable principle of transparency, it must be understood that any such principle needs to be strong where both these aspects are concerned. The rights balance each other out. We have the basis for legislation on transparency in place. The legislation must also be respected and be designed in the way that is intended and not restricted through other methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Through data supervision, the EU also shows that it is serious about guaranteeing people their fundamental rights. The right of access to documentation and to information, together with the defence of fundamental rights are both legitimate. Neither takes precedence over the other. They also balance each other out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, supported by this House. Logically, this position must also be reflected in the status of the data protection supervisor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is intended to respond, as has already been said, to two fundamental issues: the performance of the duties of this European data protection supervisor, which have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001; in other words, the issue of the pay of the European supervisor and deputy supervisor and the issue of where they are to be based. With regard to the location, I agree with those who have said that it does not make sense to have it anywhere but Brussels, for the reasons that have already been stated and which I shall not repeat. There are, however, other issues which, perhaps due to the highly technical and abstract nature of the regulation, still remain open and which should be responded to. For example, provisions on procedural aspects and on the way in which the authority should exercise its powers of investigation should be included here.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is to be regretted that there is no instrument for data protection that could apply to all the Community pillars. The duties of this supervisor will be limited to the first pillar, but Europol and Schengen – for which data protection instruments are also planned, with the creation in 2000 of a joint secretariat – are currently excluded from the post’s scope. This means that very little data of a more sensitive nature will fall within the scope of this European supervisor’s mandate, which gives legitimacy to the criticism of those who say that the pay package is probably excessive for a post with such limited duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that in the near future, the current structure and organisation of this European Data Protection Supervisor can be adapted to also include, under the responsibility of a single European authority, supervisory authorities within the European organs created on the basis of Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty, in order to prevent the unnecessary duplication of functions and resources. At the same time, it would be good to alleviate the risk of a possible duplication of some functions between the Ombudsman and this European authority, with a view to optimising the use of Community resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before going any further may I stress that the regulation we are now debating was adopted by this Parliament in codecision in a single reading, so it is a little late for some Members of this Parliament to complain about the contents of this regulation, for example where it stipulates that there should be an assistant regulator in this area. It is a little late to start complaining about that, but today we are dealing with other issues and, therefore, I should like to continue my contribution to this debate by saying that it concerns the place of data protection in relation to the right of citizens to transparent administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members who have spoken tonight have expressed concern that this initiative might impede, or even reverse, the significant progress made towards achieving the greatest possible transparency in Community administration. I must assure these Members that the principle of transparency, and in particular the principle of public access to documents as enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is applicable to the Community institutions and bodies and in particular to the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand neither of these two principles – data protection on the one hand and public access to documents on the other – has absolute force or takes precedence over the other. The Human Rights Convention as interpreted in the case law of the Strasbourg courts and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union require that a balance should be struck in specific cases in order to reconcile the various interests at issue. Any attempt to change this by putting an artificially narrow interpretation on the field of application of the fundamental rights governing data protection by denying the representatives of the new body to be set up the institutional status they need to assert their independence, would be on shaky ground. The European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has built up a body of case law on the interpretation of the scope of protection of private and family life which cannot and should not be called into question by this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this case law the professional life of individuals – employees and employers alike – is not excluded from the field of application of data protection. Amendment No 1 would introduce an unacceptable ambiguity in this respect. The status of the European Data Protection Supervisor and his deputy, who together form a sort of mini-committee, must, above all, ensure their independence in the Community institutional context beyond the mere budgetary aspects. The Ombudsman is a good Community-level reference, given his role in monitoring administrative procedures. At national level – I should like to say in particular to Mr Harbour but also to others – a judge or even a chief justice is often taken as the reference. The draft decision takes account of the two references. Any reduction in the status of the deputy would mean loss of independence without any corresponding budgetary savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 10, 11, 13 and 14 are not sufficiently precise to determine the level of remuneration of the President and his deputy. Amendments Nos 12 and 16 contain excellent ideas but the present decision's legal base of Article 43, Regulation 45/2001, is not sufficiently large to carry them.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 9 and 15 refer to parts only of the evidence and need redrafting with a view to achieving more balance. Parliament and the other institutions concerned have a great responsibility towards the citizens of Europe to ensure that the data protection system, including the supervision provided for in the Treaty as long ago as 1999, is put in place as soon as possible. With that in mind the Commission intends to be very flexible with regard to the amendments accepted in the Civil Liberties Commission in the tripartite dialogue with a view to establishing a final text of the decision by agreement between the three institutions. It also hopes that the Council, which has already expressed its agreement with the Commission proposal, may be able to act likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The preamble to the Data Protection Convention and recitals to the Data Protection Directive also make clear that their purpose is to protect the fundamental right of privacy, not to restrict the information available to citizens about public activities.
