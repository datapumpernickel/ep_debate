<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of multilingualism, especially in an enlarged Europe, is more important now than it has ever been. It is vitally important for European citizens to possess the necessary knowledge and skills that allow effective communication and facilitate mutual understanding. Simply learning a 'lingua franca' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe's true identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal sent to us by the Commission follows on from the decision by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, at which the Heads of State or Government called for improvements to the learning of basic skills with the teaching, from a very early age, of at least two languages. They also called for a common linguistic proficiency indicator, in other words, a language test to measure objectively the proficiency of citizens in foreign languages. Three years later, the Commission is proposing to create a European Indicator of Language Competence, common to all the Member States and with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The purpose of the indicator is to measure the proficiency of European citizens in foreign languages in four linguistic skills: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing. The indicator will record linguistic proficiency at each of the six levels on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe. This Common European Framework of Reference is widely accepted and is already used in many of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission that, at an initial phase, linguistic proficiency should be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union. The addition of Polish as the sixth language, at the initial phase, is something that will be determined by the budget, if of course it is feasible. A Eurobarometer poll published this week shows that English with 38%, French with 14%, German also with 14%, Spanish with 6% and Italian with 3% are the five most popular languages in the European Union which European citizens choose to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I stress in the report that it is important at the next stage to extend this test to a larger number of European Union languages. I should like to point out here that non-Community languages, minority languages and regional dialects do not concern the indicator in question. However, they may be included within the framework of the strategy on multilingualism on which the European Parliament is preparing a report and with which they are more in keeping from the point of view of content. That is why I do not agree with Amendments 1 and 2, given that they do not refer to this specific report, do not improve the cohesion of the test and do not agree with the objectives of the indicator of linguistic competence. The indicator of linguistic competence is no more than a technical instrument that will be financed through an existing programme, namely the lifelong learning programme, the main purpose of which is to substantially strengthen the mobility of citizens, workers or students in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting that, according to recent statistics, while the percentage of primary school pupils being taught a foreign language is increasing, unfortunately the diversity of languages on offer is decreasing. In many countries foreign language learning tends to mean simply learning English. The indicator can also be used to extrapolate policy conclusions at European and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the Commission's involvement in the process, the Member States must participate actively in the implementation and development of the indicator, because they alone can provide information on various factors that affect linguistic proficiency, such as television, family environment, number of hours of teaching, experience of teachers and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly speaking, the European Indicator of Language Competence is considered to be an extremely valuable instrument for obtaining reliable information on the linguistic proficiency of Europeans, in particular young people, enabling comparisons to be drawn between Member State policies on linguistic matters and facilitating the identification and exchanges of best practices, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living, studying, working and generally circulating in the European Union. We must not forget that 2006 is the 'European Year of Workers' Mobility', in which case I feel that it offers us a very important opportunity to highlight the importance of the skills of European citizens and to offer young people an incentive to attach greater importance and attention to the learning of foreign languages.</p>
<p class="contents">We await the decisions of the Council on 18 May on the subject of the indicator of language competence with great interest. I am hoping for a positive response from the Council and an understanding of its obligation to take account of the parameters and an evaluation of the overall efforts of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot close without mentioning the living example of multilingualism and its importance which we find in this House. I refer to the interpreters, thanks to whom the European Parliament is the only institution working in 20 languages, bringing our work closer to the citizens and making our communication more effective and for that I thank them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure that diversity and unity is the best basis for our enlarged European Union in this 21st century and this diversity is strongly represented and built up further by multilingualism.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just come from the first conference within the EU on minority and regional languages at the Centre Borschette. We believe that it is this diversity that makes Europe and in terms of culture and languages it should be protected and promoted. A new framework strategy for multilingualism adopted in November 2005 is a first multilingualism policy. The European Indicator of Language Competence is a very important instrument for making real progress in the area of multilingualism, which means language teaching, language learning and communication between different language communities in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavrommatis called on the Commission to encourage early language learning. We are currently funding a study of best practice in early language learning and the communication invites Member States to review their arrangements for early language learning in the light of best practice across Europe. As you rightly pointed out, it is a Member State competence, so that is why we need the Member States to be even more active.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note the emphasis on awareness raising through initiatives such as the European Day of Languages or the European Language Label. We strongly support this type of grassroots activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Further steps ahead of us are, for example, the creation of a high-level working group on multilingualism to develop new ideas and initiatives in this area. This high-level group will start work before this summer. On the basis of Member States’ reports in response to the Commission’s November communication and on the basis of the advice of this high-level group, I will present a further communication to Parliament and to the Council proposing a comprehensive approach to multilingualism in the European Union next year. We also plan to hold a ministerial conference on multilingualism next year in order to share the progress Member States have made and to plan future work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indicator of Language Competence is a highly valuable contribution in this area. Since there is no existing standardised survey of language skills across the Union, it is necessary to collect accurate and up-to-date data on the effectiveness of foreign language teaching. This indicator will show us a general level of foreign language knowledge. With such an instrument we will be able to improve more significantly the teaching and learning of foreign languages and, of course, increase the mobility of students and workers in our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to repeat my gratitude to the rapporteur and also to the Committee on Culture and Education and its Chairman Mr Sifunakis for their very valuable and continuous support for our programmes and policies. This report on multilingualism clearly demonstrates how Parliament can help the Commission and Council in our common commitment to promote diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am convinced that a decisive element in terms of the success of the European integration process and also promoting European citizenship is the citizens’ knowledge of the different European languages, in addition to their mother tongue, and that this is also positive in terms of improving mobility within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we do not currently have data on the true linguistic and communication capacities of the Union’s citizens, though we know that they differ greatly amongst the Member States, I believe that the European Indicator of Language Competence may provide a good incentive for the improvement and convergence of foreign language learning policies on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as contributing to an improvement in communication and mutual understanding amongst the citizens of Europe, this system will also lead to a qualitative improvement in the teaching of foreign languages in European education and training systems, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. The indicator will stimulate the exchange and knowledge of the good practices of the various Member States and will be a reliable system for measuring progress, initially in the five languages most widely taught within the Union: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice of these five languages for the first stage should not prejudice the other European languages, but it should represent the beginning of a process, without ruling out the possibility of including other languages during subsequent stages, of course. Specifically, thanks to the introduction of certain amendments that we have worked on in conjunction with the rapporteur, his report leaves open the possibility of a future evaluation of a greater number of official European languages, without prejudicing the teaching of the other languages not evaluated by the indicator.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to make it clear that, although this report is not the right place to deal with the situation of the minority languages or of other non-European languages, but that it is intended to improve the language competency of the citizens, the quality of teaching and learning systems for the official European languages, it should not in any way prejudice the recognition and protection of those languages that are not official in the Union, but which are official in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that I am pleased with the text since it represents an important step forward towards a closer Union amongst the European citizens, as well as being very good news in terms of improving education within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, my country, Luxembourg, is in favour of multilingualism, and perhaps on more than one account. It is, in fact, a country that does not insist on using its own national language, Luxemburgish, and in which people do not hesitate to speak German, French and English. It is a country that is careful not to overemphasise the status of its own language in the context of its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, multilingualism is the best means of promoting the unity of Europe; it is the best means of promoting mutual understanding. Yet, multilingualism is also the sign of our diversity, and the disappearance of languages spoken in a limited area must be of concern to us. We must ensure that languages that are still spoken also have the means to survive, even if it means including them within a multilingual context, otherwise we will not be able to understand each other. The measures taken by the Commission, which aim to encourage the learning of languages of neighbouring countries, are very welcome. It is this move that must lead us not only to promote the languages spoken, but also to take measures to understand our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will not hide from you the fact that I have some anxieties about the future of our European schools. We know that our officials, who are growing in number, are often called upon to move; besides, we are in the Year of Workers' Mobility. We should therefore provide for the school system in all of the European countries, in general, and make multilingualism more accessible, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every language a person learns gives him or her access to a larger cultural dimension. It is enrichening to be able, as a Finn, to read the newspapers of the whole of Scandinavia, which is what we can now do thanks to the Swedish teaching we have in Finland. If we only had a knowledge of the major languages, we should still be unable to read these languages. In Finland, Swedish is both a native language and a neighbouring language.</p>
<p class="contents">The major languages are important, and will always remain so, and it is good that a lot of people know them. It must not, for all that, be the EU’s strategy to concentrate on, for example, the five biggest languages or only the official EU languages. In the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region, it is helpful to know, for example, Swedish, Russian or Finnish. A lack of knowledge of these languages both alienates people from each other and impairs basic economic conditions. At the moment, the Baltic Sea region is the region of the EU with the most rapid growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for those who speak a minority or regional language is also of fundamental importance to European stability. For those of us who live in multilingual societies, it is only natural that the EU’s multilingual strategy should not be limited to just a handful of languages. I therefore strongly support Mrs Resetarit’s proposal that neighbouring countries’ languages and regional and minority languages be included in the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also languages outside the EU that are important. Forty-six million inhabitants of the EU have as their mother tongue a language other than that spoken by the majority of people in their countries. That is a full ten per cent of the EU’s population. We also observe that, where more than one language is spoken, economies are often more successful. A sympathetic attitude to diversity also produces economic benefits. There are no short cuts. Europe is multicultural and multilingual. Solidarity is splendid but, in order to have this, we must be able to feel that we have equality, firstly between one country and another and, secondly, within countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditionally, linguistic and regional minorities have been strong advocates of Europe and been prepared to learn other languages. Many of them are now very hard pressed. It is neither cosmopolitan in spirit nor compatible with the EU’s interests to turn our backs on a large part of our population. It is also partly in order to increase and consolidate the population’s confidence in the European Union that it is important to respect and affirm national linguistic and regional minorities. Too often, the majority populations of the EU Member States now wish to ignore their regional and national linguistic minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being said, there are some comments I should like to make. The Commission explains that the Indicator will be obtained by written exams, ‘for practical reasons’. I understand this, but I cannot understand why those same practical reasons are behind the decision to assess, and I quote, ‘the five most widely-spoken languages in the EU’. The Indicator thus obtained would run counter to the Barcelona Summit objectives, because the choice of languages establishes working guidelines for Member States interested in obtaining results. The objective that we share, that every child should learn to speak at least two languages apart from their mother tongue, can be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">Please note, Mr Figel', the Indicator is obtained by sample and via written exams. There is no practical reason why people should not be able to learn any language in the EU area. If the tests are applied to the world of languages, the conclusions might be surprising. One might find, for example, that Turkish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian are important languages in the Union and that the children of immigrants are the closest to being able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. This is why we voted in favour of the Resetarits amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should briefly like to make a second comment. The Indicator should not be confused with the certificate of language knowledge. The harmonisation of language certificates is not a cultural measure and is not socially neutral. With populist policies and public opinion divided over immigration policy, such a measure could legitimise discriminatory policies of selecting immigrants, to the detriment of the poorest countries in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Communication is a necessary and powerful tool. However, despite what the EU and many other charlatans wish to pretend, Britain uniquely is a global trading nation of considerable status. Thus the languages that should be appearing on the national curriculum – let me emphasise ‘national’ curriculum – should be those of the large and rapidly expanding economies of the world, which, in the case of Brazil, is an EU language: Portuguese. But the teaching of Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Russian would serve European countries far better than the insular concentration simply on EU languages.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggested European Indicator of Competence has its focus only on EU languages. This ignores the real world and illustrates the typical short-sightedness of the EU. It cannot be denied that part of the motivation for the Commission’s interest in this is that many, Mr Chirac included, resent the fact that the lingua franca of business throughout the world, and indeed the European Union, is English. People are becoming defensive about the potential erosion of their languages. However, the principal reason why the Commission is championing linguistic diversity is not any deep-seated fear that languages and cultures are being eroded, but the knowledge that their ultimate objective, a European federal superstate, is not possible until people can move only to be employable where the jobs are available.</p>
<p class="contents">The content and organisation of national education systems is an area in which the EU, in theory, has no jurisdiction, and this report highlights why. Member States have different priorities, different trading links and traditions, despite the EU’s detrimental attempts to change these. It is for this very reason that any attempt at harmonisational convergence throughout the EU should be opposed. The proposed Indicator offers no tangible benefits to a global trading nation, simply one of the many tools to pursue the dreadful objective of a federal Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to cultural importance, every language has special significance in terms of nation-building and also in social and economic terms. Language is therefore important in dealings with the administration and for legal purposes in their broadest sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Research suggests that almost half of the several thousand languages currently used by the nations of the world will disappear over the next 100 years. A significant amount of the knowledge amassed over the centuries will disappear with them. Accordingly, individual countries and nations are implementing a range of measures to protect their languages. Some, like Germany, have provisions in their constitutions to this effect. In others such as France, Poland and Slovakia, the national parliaments have passed laws to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavrommatis’ report deals exclusively with the motion for a European Parliament resolution on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the European Union, together with establishing language competence. It enshrines a strong preference towards two or five languages. Not one of them is a Slavonic language, even though one in four of the Union’s citizens use a language of this type. By way of example, I could refer to Polish, a language used by more than 10% of the population of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of referring to multilingualism, therefore, we should refer to the culturally dominant nations restricting and displacing the culture of smaller ones. We should refer to the operation of European institutions and the competencies of their officials, including preparing them to carry out their duties in a multilingual Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The administrative dimension of language is quite different from its economic or cultural dimensions. Research and checks have revealed widespread infringement of provisions protecting national languages, especially in the new Member States. This can be verified simply by visiting a supermarket and looking at the goods on the shelves. It would be unusual to find that the information on consumption and use of these goods had been translated. Such systematic restriction of multilingualism benefits entrepreneurs at the expense of consumers. No thought is given to the fact that the European Union will only become strong and have a <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> if it becomes user-friendly and if it makes it possible for its citizens to demonstrate respect for each other and for their cultural differences, including linguistic ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course inconceivable that English should ever be banished from the world of business and science, but German, being the first or second language of some 125 million people, is one of the most important languages in the world, and with 90 million people having it as their mother tongue, it is also the most widely spoken language in the European Union, in contrast, for example, to French, which is now spoken by only 23% of Europeans, and of those, only 11% have it as their mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, then, no doubt about multilingualism being an overarching objective, but there has recently been a perceptible, increasing, and unacceptable tendency towards the imposition of a single language, and this I believe needs to be resisted. The fact is that there is no democratic basis whatever for the favoured position accorded to English and French within the EU, and, particularly given the greater importance of German as a consequence of the enlargement, it is not acceptable that the EU should disregard long-standing agreements and more or less ignore German as a working language.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate fact that this House is as yet the only institution that not only reaches its decision in full public view but also makes them accessible to the public in their own national languages. Of the official working languages – English, French and German – it is always the last of these that draws the short straw.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, however, give way to the pressure exerted by the German <span class="italic">Bundestag </span>and now have the progress report on the accession countries translated, so perhaps this gives rise to the hope that more use will be made of German under the Finnish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cultural image of Europe is enriched by linguistic diversity. And by learning foreign languages we also become acquainted with a nation’s culture, its history and its land and this also contributes to greater mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Learning foreign languages is a real struggle for adults but for children it is more often than not a game. It is therefore right and proper that we should introduce into schools the teaching of two foreign languages even in the earliest stages of education. Knowing other languages also makes it easier for us to establish friendly ties with other peoples, and this is especially important for the peoples of neighbouring countries, since it is with our neighbours that we usually have most in common and also the largest number of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason it is sometimes beyond comprehension that certain politicians should build their political power on the limiting of the rights of minorities to use their mother tongue, as is happening to the Slovenian minority in Austrian Carinthia and the minority in Italy. Austria and Slovenia cooperate closely in various fields, and I am certain therefore that Austria’s democratic public does not approve of Mr Haider’s anti-Slovenian actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency of the European Union has been exemplary. I would therefore call once again upon the government and democratic people of Austria to abide by the Austrian State Treaty, which lays down the rights of minorities. I would also call upon the Italian Government to begin to implement the law protecting the Slovenian minority.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union institutions should also play a more important role where there are infringements of minority rights, and should issue serious warnings to countries that guarantee minority rights on paper, but in practice violate their own laws and also the rules of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">In my homeland of Estonia, widespread literacy has been considered to be elementary since the times of the Hanseatic League. Every merchant’s apprentice was expected to be fluent in the four local languages. This meant that in addition to one’s own language, one had to be able to speak the languages of the three main trading partners. The report rightly claims that language proficiency is an important precondition for citizens of the European Union to be able to enjoy the fundamental freedoms of the Union. Because services make up 70% of the volume of our economy, communication skills are of great importance in economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not likely, however, that the Barcelona objective will be achieved at the present level of effort, because the acquisition of two languages in addition to one’s mother tongue is very time-consuming and difficult. Only a very few people do so without a definite goal. The Member States should effectively motivate their citizens, and also each other’s citizens, for instance by fully implementing free movement of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The European language proficiency indicator is, however, primarily important for motivating the Member States’ own citizens in creating a certain comparative and competitive advantage. It would be dangerous for both Europe, and for language itself, to be limited to only one universal language. This would cause language to be torn out of the ground without its roots. For instance, language professors from Cambridge have difficulty understanding supposedly English-language texts that come from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would particularly like to emphasise that not only language proficiency, but also the cultures connected with those languages should be promoted on the European level.

<p class="contents">How well do young Europeans know foreign languages? Which languages are most spoken? Is multilingualism on the increase? That is what a Language Indicator is intended, in future, to find out, but considerations of efficiency and lack of funding mean that this Language Indicator is going to examine only five selected foreign languages, those being the ones that are allegedly the most widely taught within the EU. If they are going to get good marks, fifteen-year olds in every Member State will have to have knowledge of English, French, German, Spanish or Italian.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the fact that other statistics, for example the latest Eurobarometer, show that the fifth place is held by Russian rather than Italian, I think this language policy will have the fatal consequence of making English, French, German, Spanish and Italian the languages that schools will be more likely to offer in future, for no country wants to risk the stigma of being shown by the Language Indicator – any more than by the Pisa study – as bringing up the rear where language skills are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Even now, many students are more likely to want to take part in exchange programmes in France, Italy and Spain rather than in – for example – Prague, Warsaw or Budapest. Is that really what we want? Ought we not to have a rethink and promote a policy that encourages us to learn the languages of countries bordering on our own, not only for the sake of better communication, but also with business considerations in mind? Even today, an Austrian has far better chances in the labour market if he speaks an Eastern European language, no matter which one, yet, as a consequence of a misguided education policy, this skill has hitherto not been encouraged in my country’s schools.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does the language indicator provide any kind of incentive for an early change in this policy, and ‘later’ may well mean ‘too late’. We live in a very fast-moving world. What matters is not the number of people in Europe who speak one language or another, but the social and economic relations between states. I would even go further and say that, if we think not only in a European way, but also globally, it will be a very good thing if our children and grandchildren are open to all the languages of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we are now living in a global village, and that is no longer something that is capable of being changed. It is a village in which the people who get what they want will be the ones who can make themselves understood. It is counter-productive for a language indicator not to be sensitive to these future needs or flexible enough to address them, and so I again urge you all, today, to support the amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Berlin Wall would have fallen sooner if we had learnt Western languages back in the 1960s or 1980s. Although there was no ban on learning French or English in the region, there was certainly lack of motivation. Hence the great significance of the European Union’s language policy, which requires citizens in the Member States to start learning a first foreign language between the ages of 6 to 12, for example, and to begin a second after the age of 12. The principle of learning two foreign languages is excellent. It will broaden our intellectual scope, particularly in the case of representatives of popular languages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Indicator of Language Competence is very appropriate, because assessment, examinations and diplomas are a source of motivation. They constitute a reward for work and encourage further development. I cannot, however, agree to including only the five most commonly used or taught languages in the first phase. We must not handicap ourselves from the outset. For instance, Polish is not a very popular language at present, but Poland is a large country, and it could soon generate significant interest in our language too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These areas include the adoption of norms for Europass, the European City of Culture, the report on key skills for life-long learning, the European Qualifications Framework, digital libraries and many other areas. Mr Manolis Maurommatis’s report on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the EU Union – the European Indicator of Language Competence – is another such example, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The report focuses on a common goal set out in the Lisbon Strategy, namely the goal of a knowledge-based society. I consider linguistic knowledge to be an integral part of life-long learning for EU citizens, and the report submitted by Mr Maurommatis adds another tile to the mosaic of European education, rightly complementing existing plans and programmes in the area of education. The theme of language learning is important not only in terms of simplifying communication and mobility for students and employees in the European Union, but also for evaluating the skills gained during the life-long learning of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education dealing with drafting the European Qualifications Framework, which is primarily designed to set up a reference structure to transfer and recognise qualifications, I find it important to establish reliable systems for measuring progress and verifying language proficiency. As there is not enough information at present to evaluate the language skills of EU citizens properly, I am convinced that the proposed European Indicator of Language Competence should provide a key yardstick to be used by EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is undeniable that in a Union of 25, soon to be 27 different nations, having almost half a billion inhabitants and more than 20 official languages, it is imperative for individual citizens to be able to command the use of more than merely their mother tongue. To this end, measures to promote multilingualism and language learning through the introduction of a European Indicator of Language Competence seem essential and reports like the one before us this morning deserve our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, is this really the answer to achieving the best communication possible between European citizens? Would this level of communication be achieved in the most efficient and most economic way? My answer to both of these questions is no. To substantiate my position, let me use the example of our Parliament, which represents a much-scaled-down model of the multilingual EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House, representing 25 Member States, we communicate using 20 different languages. In fact it is laid down in the Treaties establishing this Union that we have the right to use our mother tongue to communicate in the organs of the EU. This is all very well, but what does it mean in practice? It means that at any given part-session there can be up to 400 cross-interpretations in this room.</p>
<p class="contents">If I were to speak in my mother tongue, Greek, to my Estonian colleague, then what I say in Greek has to be translated first into most probably English or French and then translated for the second time from English or French into Estonian. For my Estonian colleague to answer to me, then the reverse translation route has to be followed. This is not a 21st-century way of conducting communication in Europe. Not to mention the enormous amount of paperwork that is translated into 20 different languages and not to mention that approximately half the European Parliament’s budget for running costs is spent on interpretation and translation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the real answer to better communication in a united Europe is for all of us to use only one working language of communication. Yes, we have to be seen to protect and preserve our national pride and culture, but we must also progress with the times and strive for a betterment of the unity and efficiency of our European family. After all, how united can a family be if every member speaks a different language? The true unity of Europe will be achieved when we have a common working language of communication. This is in fact going to happen in the future whether we like it or not. It is inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at statistics today we see that approximately 38% of EU citizens can use English as a language of communication with French coming second at approximately 14% only. Therefore, why can we not be brave enough to take the common-sense step and at the same time as supporting multilingualism start laying down the foundations for deciding which second language will be the common language for Europe? Yes, let us face the facts, let us be practical and honest and let us say that this second language has to be English. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this instance, however, I would like to point out that the Indicator of Language Competence is an instrument for learning languages rather than for assessing their specific use in a social, economic or other context. Admittedly, it is necessary to improve, accelerate and enhance language teaching so that languages become a bridge rather than a barrier. I would like to emphasise that language and linguistic skills represent a bridge. We would be isolated islands without bridges, and bridges help us form communities.</p>
<p class="contents">A single language does not suffice – ‘English only is not enough’ – as Europe is defined by diversity. Diversity within unity is the best description of our community, but I am convinced that unity has never been and will never be defined by a single language. A family, a company, a small community or a city might communicate using a single language, but they often fail to function well, as unity is determined not by language but by the values, beliefs and principles underpinning human relations. Language plays a specific role in this process, of course, but it is not the deciding factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm that as a policy of the European Commission multilingualism envisages support for minority, regional and neighbouring languages. A specific question has been asked as to why only five languages will be used at the beginning of the test period. This is only the start of a test that will pave the way for all the official languages of the European Union. The Member States have been discussing this topic and will take a decision on it at the Council of Ministers meeting on 19 May. It is clear that the Dutch spoken in Belgium and the Swedish used in Finland will be added to these languages later, as they are both widely taught. The main criterion has been to ensure access to an adequate statistical sample in order to explore this indicator. There is no ulterior motive; our intention is purely professional, namely to develop a high-quality European indicator. In conclusion, I would again like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Committee. Mr Manolis Mavrommatis has indeed incorporated into his report everything we need to have in the EU’s policy on multilingualism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this advantage often turns into a disadvantage, because it creates communication difficulties between Member States. This is why I support the report of Mr Manolis Mavrommatis, which actively recommends early language learning.</p>
<p class="contents">In Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen that young people who speak several languages, who have the possibility of learning one or two languages in their childhood, at school, are at an advantage. Language competence is a factor that creates a social advantage. Therefore we must use all available methods to ensure that early language learning forms part of public education.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must support the efforts of the European Commission to introduce the single European Indicator of Language Competence, facilitating the comparability of language competence and the mutual recognition of certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the spirit of equal opportunities, I would like to call attention to the fact that language learning opportunities must also be provided for those who live in isolated, underdeveloped areas, with the employment of additional measures, if required.</p>
