They are old friends. Indeed, those of us who regularly attend late-night sittings here in Brussels or in Strasbourg have all become old friends. Both rapporteurs have an interest in issues relating to transport policy. In particular, they are concerned with safety standards. In this case, they deal with safety standards as they apply to passenger transport ships, and also with stability requirements for ships used for the transport of passengers by sea. These requirements also have an impact on safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs have done splendid work. In fact, all the rapporteurs for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have consistently produced splendid work on the various initiatives I have been privileged to present over the years on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Following past accidents involving ro-ro passenger ships, it emerged that if a collision takes place, the chances of survival depend largely on the stability of the ships. Even in the worst scenario, the longer a ship remains afloat, the more successful evacuation by the rescue services can be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal therefore deals specifically with this critical aspect of the safety of ro-ro ferries.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed by the Commission were developed by researchers in response to the tragic accidents involving ro-ro ferries over the past decade. The new standards amount to a significant improvement on current international standards under the SOLAS Convention. These new standards are already being implemented in northern European waters within the framework of the Stockholm Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives we are debating today will make the specific stability requirements in the Stockholm Agreement compulsory for all ro-ro ferries operating to and from Community ports. In other words, what already applies in the Baltic Sea area will in future apply in all European ports. The standards will apply not only to ships providing international services but also to those operating the main domestic routes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to highlight one other feature of the package, namely the introduction of the requirement concerning safety and accessibility for persons with reduced mobility. The European Union needs to be in line with other developed countries in this regard. Member States must ensure that the provision is applied effectively, so as to improve the safety and well-being of their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear to both rapporteurs that the Commission accepts all the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. This is because the vast majority of the amendments help to improve and clarify our original text.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the amendments deserve special mention. I am referring to Amendment No 13 by Mr Poignant and Amendment No 8 by Mr Ripoll. The Commission would have preferred to retain the original text in these two cases. Nonetheless, in view of the work already under way in the Council and since the latter shares Parliament’s view, the Commission has decided to accept both amendments in the interests of reaching a political compromise and to ensure that these standards are approved quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, I should like to highlight the excellent cooperation that has once again been much in evidence over this dossier on transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, and my thanks too to both rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this directive is to improve safety and, as is unfortunately traditional, is seeking to do so following a series of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very simple: when ships sustain damage, they must remain accessible to search-and-rescue teams for as long as possible so that the greatest possible number of human lives can be saved. Studies and experience have shown that, to this end, the quantity of water on deck must be limited as much as possible. The IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, naturally became involved very early on in these issues and concluded what is known as the ‘SOLAS’ agreement in 1990 for a certain height of water to be allowed – but I shall not go into the technical details – stipulating that all ships should comply with this agreement and its standards by 1 October 2010 at the latest. As you may remember, however, In September 1994, the Estonia disaster occurred in the north of Europe, causing 800 deaths. Following this disaster, eight Northern European countries, seven EU countries and Norway, worked together to adopt stricter standards than those in the 1990 agreement in order to prevent ships from capsizing. The question, for the Commission and for us, was knowing what needed to be done once these new standards were introduced, whether they needed to be extended to the whole of the Union or whether a distinction could be made between the north and south of the Union. Once the technical and financial studies had been carried out, the Commission rightly proposed extending these standards to the whole of the Union under the conditions the Commissioner has just explained. That is therefore what will happen. It is considered possible and reasonable and the cost to companies is deemed acceptable. There will thus be no difference between passengers travelling by ship in the north and those travelling by ship in the south.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, a number of ships have only recently been subject to these ‘SOLAS’ standards, so requiring them to adopt such a directive means asking them to start again. We must therefore consider the matter of the timing and date of the final deadline. In a spirit of compromise that everybody will understand, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have reached an agreement to conclude all of this in the year 2015. That is the essence of the fundamental amendment tabled. A few other amendments have also been tabled, which allow for adoption at first reading. I would therefore advise the House, and I believe Mr Ripoll will do likewise, to resolve this matter as soon as possible, as it does not pose any major political problems, and all ships and companies operating in waters governed by EU law should comply with the standards as soon as possible. In this way, the risk of accidents and loss of human life will be kept to a minimum, even if there is no such thing as zero risk in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also hard to find anything further to say on a report like this one. The report was adopted unanimously in the parliamentary committee. The Vice-President has accepted the amendments tabled on behalf of the Commission. There is clear determination in the Council to ensure that the package is approved at first reading. In the light of such unanimity it is hard to find anything new to say on the report. Indeed, both the Vice-President and Mr Poignant have already given an overview of the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the European Commission’s officials and the Secretariat’s officials for their cooperation. I would also like to thank the members of my team who helped me work through this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am grateful to the Commission for accepting the amendments tabled by the parliamentary committee concerning Class C and D ships. I am also delighted that the amendments affecting persons with reduced mobility have been accepted. I believe particular sensitivity has been shown in both cases. The will to ensure that things work has been demonstrated too. In addition, there is an obvious desire to ensure that the standards are neither rigid nor strict, but that they are properly complied with and help to improve relations between human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to raise another issue with you. I believe the two reports on maritime safety we are debating today and are due to approve tomorrow are important. Nonetheless, as Mr Poignant rightly said, accidents will unfortunately continue to happen. The Commission has given abundant proof of its readiness to provide swift and effective responses to all kinds of situations. Parliament has also demonstrated that it is capable of rising to challenges when immediate solutions and responses are called for.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue I have in mind is unrelated to these two reports, but it is currently giving rise to concern amongst many European citizens. I refer to the safety of pleasure craft at sea. You will recall that the matter has been raised with you in the past. I trust that in the wake of the success of the two reports debated today, you will in the near future present us with measures aimed at resolving this problem. It is a problem causing a great deal of damage and harm around the beaches of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I could not miss the opportunity offered by a day like today, when Parliament unanimously approved two reports, and you accepted all the amendments tabled. I realise this is not the most opportune moment to do so, but I hope you will allow me the liberty of throwing this particular gauntlet down before you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Poignant for all their hard work on these sister (or in this case brother) reports and in drawing up sensible conclusions for improved safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries servicing European ports and domestic voyages within Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is clearly right to bring forward these directives, stability requirements and technical updates for these ships. Key to these directives is that the requirements we are now laying down are stricter than those laid down by the SOLAS 90 Convention, thereby ensuring that accidents of the magnitude we have experienced in the European Community will be much less likely to happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also endeavour to ensure full implementation of the directives. Alongside the proposed technical improvements, I particularly welcome measures to improve the safety of persons with reduced mobility. I support Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya's proposal for a narrower definition of the term 'reduced mobility'. I also welcome the proposed improvement and accessibility of signs aboard ship and the provision of alarm systems which are not only accessible to all passengers but which can be seen and heard by all passengers. Furthermore, I believe we must ensure that the crew manning these vessels are highly trained and able to brief passengers on safety procedures in more than one language so that unnecessary loss of life is prevented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also opposed to making the specific stability requirements for ro-ro ships less stringent. Instead, we would argue in favour of maintaining the standards in question as adopted under international agreements and conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we would like to draw particular attention to our support for the Commission’s proposal for an improved definition of the concept of persons with reduced mobility. We must fight against social discrimination wherever and however it manifests itself. In this connection, it is worth drawing attention to the obstacles many groups of people encounter, and the discrimination they suffer as a result. I have in mind people with sensory or intellectual impairments, wheelchair users, people with limb impairments, elderly people, pregnant women, small children, those accompanying them, and people transporting heavy luggage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth remembering that the success of the policy on so-called seamlessness, aimed at promoting the use of public transport, depends on transfer from one form of transport to another not turning into an obstacle race. Furthermore, if the needs of persons with reduced mobility are taken into account when designing vessels, the vessels themselves will be safer and more user-friendly for all passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
