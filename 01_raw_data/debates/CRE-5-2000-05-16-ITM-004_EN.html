The fact is, I think that tolerance can only be taken so far, and that it is no longer acceptable for a parliamentary committee to set itself up as a public welfare committee, going into anything and everything with every report, setting forth considerations which are far removed from the subject under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Some 80% of this report entitled “report on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities’ financial interests”, on the legal basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, refers to OLAF, the White Paper, the reform, all sort of subjects covered by other reports, and even other committees, but has nothing to do with what Mr Bösch was supposed to be dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">According to my rights under the Rules of Procedure, I should like my preliminary question, which is a question of principle, to be put to the vote. The Committee on Budgetary Control must stop meddling wholesale, as has been the case recently, with the subject areas of other committees. We have seen rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Theato, obstructing documents outside their own area of competence for weeks at a time. Some of us are starting to become annoyed. In this specific instance, I move that this report be deemed inadmissible and that we move on to the report which is the next item on the agenda. I request that this be put to the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, allow me to start with a few comments on the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 2 May on the rights and duties of the members of this House vis-à-vis OLAF. I welcome this judgement. It clarifies that, as elected representatives of the people, we may rightly claim a special status and that, in the event of doubt, protecting our independence takes precedence. That was my position from the outset, incidentally. That was why, during negotiations with the Commission and the Council, we made all the sensitive passages in the OLAF regulation subject to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. That was why we suggested last autumn in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the provisions for members should be kept separate from the provisions for officials. Unfortunately, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not subscribe to this view. I said from the outset that members’ offices were off limits for OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Commission’s legal service took a different view. Now it has been taught a lesson by the Court. However, the court judgement has put us in a position of inequality, because only the plaintiff can cite this judgement. This state of affairs may last for a ridiculous amount of time, perhaps until a judgement is returned on the main issue, which may not be for two years. I have therefore taken recourse to Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure and proposed an amendment to the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The text which I have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control. It keeps to the letter of the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission and the Council and takes full account of the stipulations of the Court of First Instance. I urge you to support this initiative to amend the Rules of Procedure. It would allow the matter to be clarified as quickly as possible and, I think, would even allow the members who took recourse to the Court to withdraw their action. If the proposed amendment to the Rules of Procedure is implemented, their action would, as a matter of course, be pointless anyway. This too is perfectly clear from the Court’s judgement. Parliament’s internal decision was out of order, but the Parliament and Council regulation of 25 May 1999 on the work of OLAF is here to stay and is not open to question.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I fail to comprehend why a number of proposed amendments to my report claim that the Court’s judgement has strengthened the position of the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank in their opposition to the regulation. It is true that both banks maintain that the Parliament and Council regulation cannot under any circumstances be applied to them because this would encroach upon their independence. I totally fail to understand that; we have no intention of interfering in the banks’ work. What we do want is to guarantee that they have a minimum degree of protection against fraud, or do they want us to end up using private detectives to carry out this work?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors have duly implemented the provisions of the OLAF regulation in corresponding internal decisions. They certainly would not have done so if they had felt that their independence was being jeopardised. Neither bank has a plausible explanation as to why they do not accept what the independent judges of the European Court of Justice have accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Three points on the content of my report. Point number 1 concerns OLAF as an investigation unit which identifies and investigates suspicious cases quickly and efficiently. The legal basis for this is in place. Together with the Council, we have done everything within our power. The development of OLAF is well under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Point number 2 concerns the European financial public prosecutor who, in the initial stage, has the right to support the national courts in prosecuting criminal offences committed by officials or employees of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Point number 3 concerns really effective disciplinary procedures. The Staff Regulations and Financial Regulation have long made provision for the competent decision-makers to pay for damage for which they are responsible out of their own pocket in cases of gross negligence or intent. This provision has never been applied. The Commission is planning even now to delete it from the Financial Regulation. That would be precisely the wrong signal. We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">What is wrong with the present disciplinary procedures is that, of necessity, they lead to huge conflicts of interest. In the case of senior officials, the College of Commissioners decides whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted and it is the Commission which passes the final judgement, at the proposal of a disciplinary board on which senior officials have to advise on the fate of senior officials, i.e. colleagues sit in judgement on colleagues. That cannot work and it does not work. As long as this system is maintained, the accusation will be made time and again, rightly or wrongly, that proceedings are open to manipulation. Nor will this change once the disciplinary board becomes an interinstitutional board, i.e. a board of officials from various institutions. It will only change if the Commission takes up the proposal of real externalisation, as agreed by the House in the vote on the Hulten report on 19 January, in which Parliament called for disciplinary proceedings in the case of infringements of the Financial Regulation to be referred to an external chamber of the Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors so that proceedings are objective and fair beyond doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">We even stipulated in this report that the Chamber should form part of the Court of Auditors, with the Court of Justice sitting in appeal. The report also includes a number of points from the White Paper on the reform of the Commission in connection with OLAF. And yet I have just heard from some quarters that we should postpone a decision on these points and not take a stand on them just yet. Except that the Commission wants to implement all the points addressed here before the summer recess. If we do not take a stand on them now, then we can spare ourselves the trouble altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word to Mrs Schreyer: I know from conversations last week with the members of the OLAF Supervisory Committee that the recruitment and appointment procedures for OLAF are proceeding too slowly. Clearly one reason for this is that the Commission is obviously proving to be too inflexible, despite the fact that, on paper, it has transferred full powers to the director of OLAF in a decision in due and proper form. I can only urge you to stand by your own decisions and not create difficulties where none exists.</p>

(FI) </span>– Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I am standing in for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, my colleague Mr MacCormick, who is unable to be here today. In our Community, there is hardly anything worse than fraud to undermine public confidence in the activities of the Union, and so the views of the rapporteur deserve our full support. Fraud, of course, affects only a small fraction – i.e. just over 1 % – of the EU’s total budget, but it is a very serious problem which seems to extend to almost all political sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget, however, is largely administered within the Member States, and this is where huge potential for fraud exists. We must also remember that applicant countries, i.e. the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, should be involved in this fraud prevention process for the very reason that such a large share of the Community budget is administered within the Member States. So far, fewer than half of the Member States have ratified the protocol on protecting the Union’s financial interests. This process should therefore be speeded up considerably. Furthermore, some Member States are particularly unwilling to undertake the mutual exchange of information concerning fraud. Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud, for example, to the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">It is quite appropriate to examine the possibilities of creating the post of public prosecutor, expressly from the point of view of the fight against fraud, and this should be done, but even that will be to no avail, if the Member States lack the political will to protect the Communities’ financial interests. As far as OLAF’s position is concerned, it is important to protect its independence and equally important for the European Parliament to come to an agreement with OLAF with regard to the conditions on which Parliament can obtain information about its operations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First was the issue of definition. It is the case that the Commission have come under a significant amount of attention in recent years from Parliament and from the European public at large who want the Commission to deal with allegations of fraud, but it is also important that we should know what we are talking about when we define fraud. The annual report itself indicates that for the first time there has been an attempt made to try to assess what amounts to fraud and what is general irregularity, and I am of the view that it does not help the reputation of our European institutions if we are lax with definition. It is important that the work being undertaken by the Commission should be expanded because, in a situation in which 20% of irregularity amounts to fraud, the fact of the matter is that by referring to it as fraud and irregularity, European citizens can often be left with an impression that all of the claims are fraudulent ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I want to make is about the commitment of Member States to deal with fraud. The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here. They are responsible for administering some 80% of the EU's budget and they must recognise that they are, at the very least, partners if not prime movers in attempting to address this important issue, and the report indicates that the performance of Member States has been mixed to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the accession countries. We must demand that the accession countries also endeavour to work in conjunction with the European Union and to the highest standards.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past – as we are now all aware – there have been irregularities within the Commission. Each report by the Court of Auditors also highlights the decisive role of the Member States in distributing Community funds. A number of errors for which the Member States are to blame occur during the distribution of funds, which makes us apprehensive, especially as a considerable percentage is the result of fraud. Consequently, it is not just within the Commission that we need to wield an instrument to fight fraud, which we call OLAF. OLAF is the outcome of the modus operandi of the Member States and the Commission and should take on an objective role precisely so as to get to the bottom of these errors and prevent them from arising.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must use European measures such as the introduction of the euro to prove its European competence to the outside world, because the accompanying counterfeiting industry, to name but one example, is an external matter. Nevertheless, deeper causes for error rates clearly lie in the different handling systems in the Member States. Right from the outset, legislative texts are often worded differently and allow perfectly legal but differing definitions of fraud. This opens the door to fraud. Just think of the example of the collection of value added tax. Under no circumstances should OLAF become nothing more than a help desk. OLAF is not one of your broadcasts for DIY enthusiasts, along the lines of “How can we build a model railway?”</p>
<p class="contents">The issue should not be taken lightly. Protecting the financial interests of the Union and fighting fraud are a necessity, pure and simple, which call for a uniform instrument which can act independently, preventively, efficiently and as a deterrent, and which depend upon transparent regulations both internally and externally, so that everyone knows where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like this financial instrument to have an additional name such as prosecutor, a broad-shouldered European financial prosecutor. This prosecutor must be accepted by the Member States, take on an active role and, at the same time, be integrated into the national jurisdiction of the Member States. I would remind you at this point that Parliament called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline in its resolution of 19 January. In my view this is a good idea and is not only worth considering, it is indispensable if we are to create a comprehensive area of justice and law. A neutral, objective judgement will serve the cause and the individual concerned, condemnation of colleagues by colleagues will not. OLAF is no Big Brother à la Orson Welles, but is limited in its remit by the rule of law. The immunity of members, for example, will of course continue to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Intergovernmental Conference to take our concerns on board. We are fighting here for technical measures which, hopefully, will not turn into a long-running saga. We must concentrate once again on European values so that, for example, our money is not misappropriated for the drawing up of military measures. I know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person. But that is where our efforts should be concentrated. Because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It needs to be pointed out here that this is a decisive step in protecting the financial interests of the Union, the impetus for which came from this House and, in particular, from the Committee on Budgetary Control and from the present rapporteur, our colleague, Herbert Bösch. With an increase in staff, with a new structure and independence, all the conditions are now in place for OLAF to concentrate on fighting fraud in an area where the objective and verifiable figures point to a more serious situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fraud and other irregularities in the traditional own resources reported by Member States reached a total of EUR 538 million in 1998, an amount unparalleled in any other area of Community expenditure, either in absolute or relative terms. Special report No 9 of the Court of Auditors on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests in the area of VAT on intra-Community trade points to an even more serious situation. According to the Court of Auditors, the gap between actual receipts and their theoretical amount is EUR 70 thousand million. Unlike the main areas of expenditure, which the Commission monitors and on which it imposes a system of sanctions, there is nothing comparable in these two vital areas of the Community’s own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, specifically in its recent reports on administrative cooperation and on procedures for collection and taxation, describes a situation which is characterised by the maintenance of a system for VAT collection, which was only intended to be used on a temporary basis but is being used permanently. This system is also characterised by the increasing complexity of the system and by the widespread shortage of human resources and monitoring materials compared to the volume of transactions. Despite the fact that there is widespread agreement on the need to overcome the problems of fighting fraud which result from restrictions imposed by national legislation, or to the lack of a legal basis in Community legislation, the Commission’s proposals have not, until today, met with any response and the anti-fraud sub-committee in the area of indirect taxation has found it impossible, in the words of the Commission “to achieve meaningful progress and cannot take the necessary decisions to improve the fight against fraud”. What is more serious than this is the fact that the Commission’s reports on VAT collection have been scandalously disregarded by the other institutions and have not been followed up to any degree by the Member States. Compliance with Article 280 of the Treaty, specifically where it requires the effective and equivalent protection of the Community’s financial interests will be dead letter unless we overcome the situation of there being a loophole in the law in the area of traditional own resources and VAT. The protection of the Community’s financial interests, and particularly those of the taxpayers, who comply, cannot continue to be disregarded when it comes to indirect taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many points in the present resolution which the Liberal Group can endorse. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and this cannot be repeated enough – we think that at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, a decision should be made in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor, which in its capacity as an independent body, will work to safeguard the financial interests of the European Union. We would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect as soon as possible. Also, the date mentioned in the report is important, in our opinion. </p>
<p class="contents">We also endorse the proposal for an external chamber to enforce budget discipline, which will mainly be concerned with examining the financial liability of officials. In our opinion, it is important that this task is taken from the Commission, so as to take away any semblance of nepotism and such like. </p>
<p class="contents">OLAF starts its first full working year this year. We will all have to wait and see what the outcome of that will be. Expectations are naturally very high. One aspect, however, could be improved on, namely the Supervisory Committee, as Mr Bösch calls it in his report. Everyone has a right to a defence, including those who need to be investigated by OLAF. We must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible. I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too. </p>
<p class="contents">There has been a lot of publicity lately surrounding the issue as to whether or not OLAF should be able to investigate the European Investment Bank regarding the use of European funding, as well as the European Central Bank. The Liberal Group is of the opinion that this should clearly be the case as these are European institutions too. They cannot remain outside OLAF’s general scope of investigation. We support the Commission so as to make this possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, over the past few years, the European Court of Auditors has become increasingly aware that fraud and irregularities in structural funds are on the increase, whilst those in agricultural funds are still excessive but are dropping. This is diametrically opposed to the opinion held by the Commission, which believes that fraud and irregularities occur far less in structural funds than they do in agricultural funds. This anomaly must be resolved without delay. The structural funds are gaining in importance all the time and form a large area of investigation for OLAF and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We might as well admit it, there are a great many money-grubbers active within the European Union, and organised crime no longer concentrates solely on drug smuggling, the arms trade, trafficking in humans, meat fraud, alcohol and cigarette smuggling, VAT merry-go-round fraud and oil fraud, and has not done so for a long time. They are all forms of crime which cause serious harm to the EU’s budget, both on the revenue side and the expenditure side. We may have had a single market since 1993 which accommodates the free movement of goods, services, people, capital, as well as organised criminals, but this single market does not exist – and this is so unfortunate – for police services and magistrates alike. </p>
<p class="contents">On my own behalf, I will therefore stick my neck out and endorse all paragraphs of the Bösch report which call for the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor’s office. I know it is a controversial issue, even within my own group. Despite this, I believe that such a European Public Prosecutor’s office should be set up. I would therefore ask the European Commission, as a matter of extreme urgency, to meet the request of the Bösch report to add an extra clause to the present OLAF regulation before 30 June, providing for a kind of trial project in which a European Public Prosecutor is appointed from within OLAF who can only act on behalf of members and staff of the European institutions. I entreat Commissioner Schreyer to give very specific answers to this request and would ask her whether she would be prepared to take any initiative in this matter before 30 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fraud is a scourge as far as the EU is concerned. I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States’ budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities. In my own country, it is close on zero per cent, and I think that what we have noted in recent years in the EU’s accounts reflects the fact that common funds are not handled so carefully and meticulously as money which the States regard as their own. Mr Bösch's report goes a very long way towards representing the positions adopted by my group, most especially in its observations concerning the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank. We have a problem in relation to appointing a European Public Prosecutor, whose office we would regard as an integral part of the federal EU we do not wish to see. We think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level. We are quite clear about the fact that these provisions are aimed especially at the new Member States whose legal arrangements differ from those of the EU countries. We think, however, that this ought to be an incentive to engage in negotiations designed to promote cooperation between the legal systems. However, it is not, of course, by means of the present report that we are to decide this matter and, against that background, I should like to inform you that my group is voting in favour of Mr Bösch's report because we think that there are clear demands which Parliament is making here and with which the Commission must comply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The other paragraphs are about something completely different. Important matters, I do not deny, but matters which have already been dealt with in the van Hulten report and the Theato report, or matters which will be dealt with when we come to discuss the White Paper, the reform and OLAF, with the judgement and the ruling of the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am astounded that Mr Bösch is pleased with this because he was one of the people who thought that Parliament’s text was fine and that OLAF was entitled to poke its nose in everywhere, though this is not the case. The European Central Bank was thus quite justified in saying that it was not very sure what authority OLAF actually had in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My criticism of the Bösch report, then, is the very simple reason that we have other instruments. A situation whereby the Committee on Budgetary Control’s many reports keep bringing up the same subject is not normal. Let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor. Mrs Theato attempted to have this adopted as a legislative initiative. She did not succeed. The Committee on Budgetary Control tried to do so, and Parliament rejected it. This is not a proposal for a legislative initiative. What, then, is the point of harping on all the time about something which is, obviously, a problem area? Even though the fraud problem primarily affects the Member States, you wish to set up a special court, ad hoc courts. You know, Mr Bösch, in the past, in Italy and other countries, they had special courts. Probably in your own country too, and these were not exactly models of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would adopt a more cautious approach. I think this report is a waste of a lot of paper. Mrs Stauner might well write another letter asking why so much money has been spent in order to repeat things that have been said already, Mr Bösch, but which it was not worth repeating. What is more, many of the amendments seek to remove paragraphs. We shall readily vote in favour of these because we must confine ourselves to the points included in the reports and it is high time that this practice, which is common to all the committees, were adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with the way in which the problems are described, but I do not believe that crime and theft are combated by establishing a common public prosecution service and common penalties and by appointing more inspectors within the EU. I believe that it is through transparency that irregularities can most effectively be cleared up: complete openness about the budget procedure, complete openness as to who has been involved in deciding upon an appropriation, complete openness about who the recipient of the appropriation is and complete access to all documents for the ombudsman and for the European Parliament’s and the national parliaments’ auditors and supervisory committees. If it can always be seen who has obtained what, fraud will be revealed by journalists and a critical public – perfectly free of charge and with far greater preventative effect. I would therefore ask the Commissioners to promise us that, in future, Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the ombudsman will be allowed to see any document. What are we not allowed to see? What is the ombudsman not allowed to see? When will we be given a complete overview of all the committees and working parties, together with their members? Will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds? Lack of transparency is the fraudsters’ best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters. It is due to a lack of transparency that the new Commission too will, unfortunately, be concealing fraud instead of bringing every instance of it into the light of day and so deterring anyone else who might have the same idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The most interesting parts of his work are surely those which refer to the subject of the report, that is to say 1998, and OLAF, the body which is presenting its first piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that this report perhaps prejudges certain aspects which should be subject to further debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control and in this House, but I would like to highlight the positive aspects of its contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to 1998, I believe that we should recognise that, after having intensified the task of control, which should be initiated by Parliament and which OLAF carries out, the number of cases of fraud and irregularities has stabilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Without relaxing our efforts to control expenditure – of which we have shown signs in the past – we can see that this stabilisation has been the result of an increase in control. We should therefore be pleased about this and hope that this work continues, so that cases of fraud can be reduced rather than merely stabilised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, in fundamental fraud, there are discrepancies between what the Court of Auditors says and what OLAF says. In OLAF’s judgement, it appears that it is not in the Structural Funds that fraud and bad management prevail. It is other expenditure that we should be concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, returning to OLAF, by means of this report, we should, in my view, ask for OLAF to be provided as soon as possible with the officials which have been allocated to it. However, I think it is very important that, in this first stage – precisely because we are interested in control – we do not increase OLAF’s scope of activity so soon after it has begun its work.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that there are and there will be – although we hope that this is not the case – great problems with the counterfeiting of currency, trademarks or VAT. It is essential that we allow OLAF to continue to pursue its scope of activity little by little and that we expand its role at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not duplicate responsibilities. In order to use resources correctly, one body should be responsible for each issue and we should not have a situation where everybody is responsible for everything. I therefore believe that we should clearly separate objectives and not allow confusion to reign. At the end of the day "he that too much embraceth, holds little", as we say in Spain, so if we want to manage control, we cannot all have the same objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As usual – and as has already been mentioned – the annual report shows that in 1998 too, an excessive proportion of the European resources was not spent according to the rules. As usual, most irregularities pertain to expenditure in the Member States and vary in nature. The irregularities are partly caused by deliberate abuse of the regulations, partly due to errors in the implementation of European legislation or simply down to bad policy. I would like to distance myself somewhat from what Mr Mulder said on this score. The fact that so much fraud is being committed using agricultural funds is a sign that something is wrong with the way in which we organise our support for agriculture and this needs to change. The steps required to fight fraud have been mentioned on countless occasions, including today. I would like to highlight two. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are still Member States that have not signed the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU. My own country is one of them and I hereby call on the Dutch Parliament to ratify the act which ratifies the Convention and which has been with the Chamber since October. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is also important that steps are being taken within the Intergovernmental Conference to appoint a European Public Prosecutor. To my amazement, I noticed that in one of the amendments to this report tabled by the PPE-DE Group, an attempt was made to limit the mandate of this public prosecutor, whilst I was under the impression that the PPE-DE was actually in favour of it. The PPE-DE Group would like to limit the European Public Prosecutor’s mandate to the European institutions only, while we have just seen that most fraud takes place within the Member States. The PPE-DE Group had better have a good explanation for this. </p>
<p class="contents">We have made a new start with the independent OLAF. In my opinion, it is rather important for the functioning of OLAF that its work be open to public scrutiny, and for there to be set rules governing investigations, which are available for perusal by Parliament too. This will prevent us from running behind the facts in future, as is now the case with the 1998 discharge procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my last point concerns the European Parliament itself. As you know, the Court recently decided in an initial ruling that OLAF only has limited access to the European Parliament. I regret that the Court has reached this decision and hope that it will arrive at a different decision in the final ruling. Meanwhile, however, I would like to make it clear that immunity for parliamentarians does not mean that we are above the law. If the Court’s final ruling stipulates that OLAF has no access to Parliament because the rules will not permit this, we must adapt our rules rather than overrule the decision, so as to grant OLAF access to Parliament, including parliamentarians, because, I repeat, we are not above the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as we are concerned, combating fraud is more than a priority, it is a commitment we have to the people who elected us. This principle has been emphasised all the more by the revelation of inefficiencies within the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, our determination to implement sound management procedures beforehand that are capable, subsequently, of being monitored must be absolutely foolproof. In order to do so, we must focus on the effectiveness of the procedures set in place, particularly under OLAF. So, I beg you, please, do not try, for ideological reasons, to come and complicate matters, adding yet more structures and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why we are not in favour of creating a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. We must be able to have confidence in relying on the national structures. In fact, the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor’s Department is unacceptable since this requires us to be effective immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, we shall support Amendment No 13 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which will prevent us creating a budgetary discipline body just for show. These declarations of intent are more than anything motivated, I fear, by the determination to establish a European sovereignty on the pretext of protecting the Community budget, which, I must remind you, is made up of contributions from our Member States. From the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud, these creations are no more than fresh grounds for sterile conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I feel that the Commission’s watchwords must be rigour, discipline and proper collaboration. I sincerely believe that the rest can be achieved by adhering to OLAF’s prerogatives, combined with proper cooperation between national and European audit authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at European level. Other surveys in the past have always confirmed that this applies both to Germans and to the citizens in most other Member States of the Union. We are therefore responding to the expectations of the people in tabling proposals on how to strengthen effectively the protection of the European Union against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">There are without doubt more pleasant topics of conversation than fraud and corruption, I grant you, but discussing them demonstrates clearly that we are not sweeping this tricky question under the carpet; on the contrary, we are setting ourselves this challenge, in precisely those cases which affect the institutions of the Union itself. This is why the Bösch report deserves particular attention and support. It was not adopted unanimously by the Committee on Budgetary Control for nothing, as I have already explained. Allow me to congratulate you on this report. It clearly illustrates that creating the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF is an important step, but is only a step on the path towards the European prosecutor which I have called for time and again both in a personal capacity and as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">A public prosecutor’s office to protect the interests of the Union against fraud would be the only really effective instrument to counteract the threat from organised crime. Organised crime has identified the institutions of the European Union as a particularly easy target. I am delighted that both the Commission and Parliament have included this question in the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control has gone one step further in this report. We want an even more proactive approach and are therefore waiting for the Commission to present proposals for the first stage of a European public prosecutor’s office on the basis of the current Article 280 and I really do hope, Commissioner Schreyer, that you will revise your unfortunately somewhat wait-and-see attitude and accommodate us here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to refer to what was indeed said earlier but could not be answered. My question is to Mr Dell'Alba; could the honourable Member explain what I, as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, allegedly blocked for weeks. I require an answer and I should like it recorded in the minutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I contend, together with the group chairmen, who have, moreover, disclaimed you, that on the 13 April you informed the Conference of Presidents that on the whole you were in agreement with the spirit of Annex III on the exchange of information with the Commission. I contend that twenty days later, to the outrage of your partner, Mr Napolitano, you sent a letter in which you said you could no longer agree to this annex. You mentioned points in German which no one had checked, causing uproar among the group chairmen who thanked you, saying that they would take the dossier back because in effect the situation was no longer tenable. One group chairman even left the room on an occasion when the matter came up on the agenda one day. Do not pretend that you know nothing, you know perfectly well what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">There are perhaps some of my fellow Members of Parliament who do not know, but I am stating this for the benefit of the House, so that it can be entered in the Minutes: for several weeks Mrs Theato obstructed an agreement with the Commission, thereby putting the President of Parliament and the chairmen of the political groups in an awkward position.

It demands that the Members of this Parliament act responsibly. We must address the lack of moral responsibility on the part of bureaucracies, which was condemned in such a masterly way by Kafka. This lack of moral responsibility is perversely able to involve people in a labyrinthine quest for their exact legal position and subject them to phantom judgements regarding unknown crimes. These situations have happily been overcome in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of an effective and transparent office to fight fraud is a task with which all Members of this Parliament agree, and I hope that all the institutions agree. The creation of an omnipotent mechanism, designed to pursue officials on the basis of secret denunciations, accusations and lists of suspects, riding roughshod over the individual guarantees, statutes and regulations which provide basic legal security for people working in the institutions, is a form of irresponsibility which this Parliament or any Community institution should have nothing to do with, because such a climate of suspicion would only benefit the eurosceptics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group, which is interested in combating fraud as well as protecting the rights of citizens, including officials, and the construction of a Europe based on the principles of fair play, democracy, proximity to the citizens, transparency, efficiency and solidarity, has presented an amendment to paragraph 29 of this report, which lays down the principle that combating fraud should not take precedence over the basic rights of officials. To demand lists of suspects, as suggested in the report, would be a form of McCarthyism which is beneath the dignity of this House and, furthermore, it may possibly be illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that claims have been made that no action has been taken against this type of action and that OLAF’s monitoring committee, in relation to these appeals, is aware that certain aspects are not functioning properly within this body. While accepting that, with the dynamic of European construction, the increase in the budget and the growth of the administration, there may be more fraud and errors, we must not fall into a kind of policing paranoia, or at least this Parliament must not.</p>
<p class="contents">The immunity which we enjoy as MEPs must not be confused with impunity. It is important that this report does not simply create a Kafkaesque type of system, but that it also provides a guarantee for officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have some sympathy with the last speaker: sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing, that they are unable to see the wood for the trees. I also welcome the presentation on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which took a balanced approach to the major and indeed legitimate concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control about fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mr van Hulten's reference to the fact that OLAF should have the right to investigate Members of Parliament. He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that. But before we embark on such a radical decision, we should look at the history, particularly in the United States, of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF. In the end, OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not throw staff, money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist. Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem. Mr Bösch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs. I do not agree with all of his report. There are a number of paragraphs I have doubts about – 14, 15 and 16 for example, regarding the legal basis and whether it is necessary to involve both national and European responsibility to resolve problems of fraud that affect national states more than they do the European Union.</p>

The very fact that my Italian colleague is opposed to it means that it really is a report of very high quality. Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998, there is nonetheless still a need for more effective supervisory mechanisms. Reform of the Commission is now under way. Mr Kinnock has submitted a timetable, and it is now up to us to applaud it. I am very impressed with the reform plan. In general, it is both visionary and realistic. There are nonetheless a number of sticking points, and these are what we ought to draw attention to and criticise. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors. This would deal with disciplinary matters and help recover money which has been paid out unlawfully. This idea is one we should stick to, I think. If such a body were to be established, this would mean that disciplinary matters would be taken away from the Commission. We have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils. At present, officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them. That is indefensible. Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs. I also agree with the rapporteur when he criticises setting up an advisory panel to deal with irregularities. We have, of course, established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities. Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF’s powers. I cannot, however, vote in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor’s office. I can well understand people’s being tired of all the fraud and therefore demanding that we have a common public prosecutor’s office. It would, however, be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problems are, in reality, elsewhere. In actual fact, there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform. It is, for all that, only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences. Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence. Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people. We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure, as also proposed in the report. I would also point out that I had three minutes in which to speak. I spoke for only two, but I am very disciplined. I am happy to let someone else use my time. You should also, of course, be allowed to make mistakes from time to time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I should like to go into a few points which, as far as I am concerned, are relatively unclear.</p>
<p class="contents">Problem number one: every year the media present the refusal to issue a declaration of assurance as an indication of the alleged or actual state of corruption in EU finances. At the same time, however, both the Court of Auditors and the Council of Ministers grant this refusal to issue a declaration of assurance the status of a mere water-level report, while we here in Parliament and the media see it as an indication of the poor state of the Union’s finances. I think we need to amend and clarify the basis of the matters about which we are talking. Otherwise we shall find ourselves in a situation in which every year we regularly and hence permanently, as it were, negligently cast an air of general suspicion over the state of EU finances, if this state of affairs is allowed to continue. </p>
<p class="contents">Problem number two: of course further investigation may show that some financial irregularities are in fact cases of fraud. Nonetheless, these two points need to be kept apart both in terms of how they are defined and how they are measured, because otherwise they will both be lumped together and this will give the impression of a huge level of fraud which is not justified to that extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Problem number three: clearly – and I am grateful to Mr Bösch for pointing this out – the findings of the Court of Auditors differ from those of the Commission as to the extent of financial irregularity which has occurred in relations between the agricultural budget and the Structural Funds. Clearly there are measuring problems, statistical problems which we must solve so that we know what we are talking about when we start investigations or conduct further investigations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is the acknowledged expert within the European Parliament and, to a large extent, was the architect of the new OLAF. One thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the EU is big stories about fraud. They always get big coverage. That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable. The figure that is being attached to it is about 5% of the EU budget. But there are two important points to remember, which have been touched upon several times here today – and Mr Cunha has just raised them again. The Court of Auditors does not distinguish between fraud and administrative and financial irregularities; that is, administrative mistakes and people who set out to cheat the EU of money. To give you an example, a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly. That is not to say that he means to defraud. It may be that he measured his land incorrectly. And then there are the big fraudsters: the people who, for example, import cigarettes illegally, avoiding tax. There is a huge difference between these two things. We need to have them distinguished much more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that 80% of the fraud takes place within Member States. Yesterday the Commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 2%. We want to know whether the Member States will follow that lead. It is clear that a lot of the problems lie there, in particular with the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">To take up Mr Dell'Alba's point, the Socialists will be voting against a number of paragraphs in this report, not necessarily because we do not agree with them, but because it is not the right context in which to discuss these points which relate to the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to read out a list of shame – Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and France. It is about time they signed up. They have had five years to do it. Let us see them ratify it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against fraud and protecting the financial interests of the Community are among the top priorities of the new Commission. The fight against fraud includes activities such as preventing, uncovering and prosecuting customs and subsidy fraud or tax evasion, as well, of course, as uncovering and prosecuting irregularities within the institutions of the European Union. But I am most pleased that numerous contributions to the debate have stated that we need to make a distinction between financial irregularity and fraud. When we talk of the Court of Auditors’ report, this covers the whole spectrum of financial irregularities. We are talking here of the UCLAF or OLAF report on fraud, i.e. deliberate damage to the financial interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before you, which is the subject of Mr Bösch’s report, is the last report drawn up by UCLAF on the fight against fraud in 1998. Although UCLAF only had 120 employees at the time, this annual report illustrates the considerable success of their work, in my view. There were 5,318 cases of suspicion of irregularity or fraud investigated by UCLAF in 1998, in cooperation with the Member States, and around 20% of these cases were classed as fraud following the investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out in connection with the question as to why the findings in the Court of Auditors’ report are different, that it has been ascertained that the number of irregularities is falling in the area of agricultural policy, while it is clearly highlighted here that regulations as to which cases of fraud or suspicion must be reported to the Commission differ from one Member State to another, and this explains the difference between the two reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak stated in his speech that the citizens of the European Union are sick and tired of fraud. Unfortunately, I must point out that duty- or tax-free cigarettes still sell like hot cakes and tax evasion is often regarded as a national pastime. In this respect, we face a situation in which we must acknowledge that we cannot completely eradicate fraud which damages the European Union's financial interests. We must of course do everything within our power to fight customs offences and offences in connection with subsidies and taxation which damage the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to go into the individual proposals in the Bösch report which now come within a wider context; this applies, for example, to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the European Court of Auditors. The Commission explained in its statements on Parliament’s demands in connection with the 1998 discharge procedure that it did not think that the right way forward was to call in a chamber of the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice to issue orders in disciplinary proceedings against employees on the grounds of irregularities in connection with the budget, because the European Treaties had granted each of these bodies its own specific remit. It is precisely the European Court of Justice to which employees can take recourse if they wish to appeal against a judgement in disciplinary proceedings. As a result, such a move cannot be reconciled with the present Treaties. The Commission therefore decided to take up the proposals contained in last year’s independent experts’ report, which are extremely comprehensive and relate to overall financial management, fraud prevention and disciplinary procedures. The Commission explained that it also shared Parliament’s view that confidence in the objectivity of disciplinary proceedings would be enhanced by involving an outside agency. It explained this in its White Paper tabled on 1 March and will also make detailed proposals on reforming disciplinary law in the paper on the overall future disciplinary procedure to be published by the Commission in October. Naturally we shall include Parliament’s considerations in the overall procedure and in our proposals during discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">It was rightly pointed out in numerous debates and in the report that good cooperation and the involvement of the Member States are essential if the fight against fraud to the detriment of the financial interests of the European Community is to be efficient. Article 280 of the Amsterdam Treaty also makes this clear. The complaint was also rightly voiced that the corresponding agreement between the Member States has only been ratified by a few Member States. I should like to thank all the speakers who wrote home calling for the necessary steps to be taken at long last. OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, is itself working intensively with the Member States and, in certain areas, with other countries, in order to conclude cooperation agreements. Since the UCLAF report was filed, the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF has succeeded, for example, in concluding an agreement with the Anti-Mafia in Italy, the aim being to achieve good cooperation at all levels and with all organisations dedicated to fighting fraud. A conference on this subject is to be held in Ancona at the end of the week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that some enlargement countries are already taking steps to set up and activate structures similar to those set up by the European Anti-Fraud Office. In Poland, for example, it has been decided to set up a Polish OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to go into the subject of “What happens next in the legislative area?” and point out that the Commission has proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference, which is responsible for revising the Treaties, that the present system for protecting the financial interests be supplemented by a legal basis creating a European Public Prosecutor and allowing provisions on the criminal prosecution of cross-border fraud to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have indicated that they will not amend the Treaty in this area. However, the Commission does not intend to give up on this and we are continuing to refine this proposal and will ensure that it is on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment briefly on the complaints filed by the Commission against the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank. The aim is to implement precisely what was introduced into the OLAF regulation by the European Parliament, namely that OLAF is responsible for fighting fraud in all the institutions of the European Community. Unfortunately, neither bank has made a move over recent weeks. They too have probably been waiting for the outcome of the litigation pending as the result of the proceedings instituted by a number of members against the amendment of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I think that the summary procedures of the Court of First Instance have in fact made it clear that what is at issue is not the legal bases for OLAF – in this respect neither bank can withdraw or hide behind this – the issue is, of course, the need to safeguard the independence of the institutions. Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank. Of course, the other issue is that it needs to be made clear that the immunity of members is a democratic achievement and cannot be interfered with under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you for calling for account to be taken of the principles of the rule of law in all procedures, including the work of OLAF. I think that the new director of OLAF defends this view very vigorously, including in a personal capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have the opportunity of debating other reports on the subject of fighting fraud this year. The OLAF Supervisory Committee, which monitors the independence of OLAF, will soon submit its report, which we shall also have the opportunity to debate. I should point out that the Commission is currently working on a fundamental strategy paper on the fight against fraud. This too will certainly lead to further intensive and fruitful debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his report and, above all, I should also like to thank the House for supporting the introduction and the work of OLAF so unwaveringly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
