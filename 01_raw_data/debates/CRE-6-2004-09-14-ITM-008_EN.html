<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Council.</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me, on behalf of the Council, to be able to present to you the draft Budget as we have decided it for 2005 in the Council in July.</p>
<p class="contents">As European Affairs Minister, I will be making regular visits in the next few months, and that is why I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating you once again, partly officially, on your election as Members of the European Parliament. In particular, I should like to mention the chairmen of the two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">As the two branches of the budgetary authority, you in the European Parliament and we in the Council, we have enjoyed excellent cooperation in the past few years, and I am convinced that we can continue in the same fashion. In my view, the conciliation meeting we had in July last sets the right tone for this. During that conciliation meeting, we came to a number of sound agreements, and I should like to mention one here, namely the provision of information on the part of the Council to you in the European Parliament in the light of the forthcoming financial perspectives. I think that that is a good starting point for our, that is the EU presidency’s communications and dealings with you, the European Parliament, including where the financial perspectives are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few general observations about this Budget’s guiding principles and follow this up by making a few specific explanatory comments about the different headings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has, of course, in deciding on the draft budget, taken into consideration the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 with which you are familiar. This Agreement pertains to, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the importance of ceilings and compliance with them, and of discussion on adequate margins, on unforeseen circumstances and flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has emphasised that sufficient payment appropriations must become available without losing touch with reality in the process. We must avoid overestimating the level of payment appropriations. The excessive surpluses that have materialised over the past few years do not reflect the best financial management. Moreover, I am certain that you in the European Parliament will also agree that, as all Member States and all national parliaments have to observe strict discipline, we should do the same at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have been able to see, we in the Council have listed with great care our priorities and posteriorities in the different headings of the financial perspectives. One priority I should like to highlight is the importance of providing the new Member States with sufficient leeway, in line with the agreements we have made in this respect previously, including in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the bracket of general explanatory comments, I should like to mention the importance of what we call activity statements. I think that that is a good new way that improves quality and the provision of information, and that is an improvement on the way in which we deal with the Budget. Consequently, the Commission has been asked to continue the efforts in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to run through the different categories, starting with the general remark that, as you know, the draft Budget provides for an amount of EUR 116 billion for commitments, which is 4.1% more than in the 2004 Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As for payment appropriations, that is to say, the cash that the European Union will be required to pay out during 2005, a total of EUR 105 billion has been set aside for this purpose. That represents an increase of 5.4% compared to the appropriations for the current year, and corresponds to 0.99% of the Union’s gross national income.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Heading 1, agriculture, I should like to comment as follows. In previous years, the estimates were often too high. The Council has therefore decided to reduce by a total of EUR 1 billion the amounts proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget for common agricultural policy. We have done this by a general reduction of all items on the preliminary draft budget amounting to more than EUR 800 million. However, the Council has taken account of the fact that the ultimate level of appropriations will be determined in the autumn, when the Commission presents its letter of amendment as agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Heading 2, the structural measures, the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget for this heading. Nevertheless, and in the light of the substantial under-use of the resources for structural measures, the Council has decided to lower the level of payment appropriations. Accordingly, the payment appropriations proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget have, by means of a general reduction, been cut by EUR 3 billion. The resulting appropriation corresponds to the expected implementation level. This reduction also impacts on Community initiatives and the completion of programmes dating from before 2000. In this connection, however, I should like to emphasise that the payment appropriations which the Council determined in its draft budget, even after this discount, are still significantly higher than the implementation level in the previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Heading 3, internal policy, the Council has decided to adopt the amounts in the draft budget that were proposed in line with the codecision procedure for multi-annual programmes, as agreed following enlargement. This also applies to specific amounts related to the Copenhagen conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, however, has restricted the appropriations for a few budget lines that are not based on multi-annual programmes. This applies to press and communication and to the preparatory measures in the area of security research. The Council takes the view that the amounts that the Commission had allocated to a few specific agencies were in excess of what can be regarded as realistic in view of their recent inception.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the choices within Heading 3 to which I have just referred, the Council provides for a margin of EUR 108 million under the ceiling for Heading 3 of the financial perspectives. On the basis of this margin, the European Parliament will also need to be able to set its own priorities for internal policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of Heading 4, external actions, the Council has deviated from the approach for which the Commission had opted in its preliminary draft budget. The Council was of the opinion that more detailed choices needed to be made in the list of priorities, so as not to exceed the ceiling of Heading 4 of the financial perspectives. Indeed, the deployment of the flexibility instrument is not at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has, however, adopted the amounts proposed by the Commission for reconstruction in Iraq. Bearing in mind the resources required for the common foreign and security policy, the Council has maintained the level that was determined for this in the final budget for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fund these priorities under the existing ceiling of Heading 4 of the financial perspectives, however, the Council has applied a small, proportionate reduction to the amounts proposed by the Commission for the principal budget lines; the appropriations for international fisheries agreements have been given proportionate consideration. As such, the amounts have been reduced to the level of the financial resources for the current year, with a small margin in Heading 4 for unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and expect that, at the second reading of the Budget for 2005, we can reach agreement as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement, with regard to the final budget for the CFSP and international fisheries agreements. As for the presidency’s efforts in the area of information on foreign policy, I should like to report what has been agreed with Parliament. As you know, on 21 September, the next meeting will take place within the framework of the special agreement we reached in this respect with your House under the Italian Presidency. We will try to inform you in good time of the developments during that meeting. I would also refer to the speech which Mr Bot, the Foreign Affairs Minister, recently delivered to your Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation with regard to Heading 5, administrative expenditure, is rather complicated. The institutions’ collective estimates have led to the ceiling being exceeded. I would, however, remind you that our institutions had already decided beforehand against the deployment of the flexibility instrument for administrative expenditure for 2005. A controlled development of administrative expenditure goes hand in hand with healthy financial management. I am convinced that you as Members of this House, the other wing of the budgetary authority, share the Council’s view of healthy financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has therefore decided that a margin of around EUR 50 million will be sufficient, taking into consideration the cutbacks that have been made further to the development of information technologies and interinstitutional cooperation, as well as specific recruitment programmes for personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to Heading 7, the pre-accession strategy, for which the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission. Given the expected implementation level of these measures, however, the Council has slightly reduced the payment appropriations as proposed by the Commission, and has brought them into line with real needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to thank your Parliament for its attention thus far, and to wish you every success with the debates on this draft Budget. I hope and trust that we will be able to present, on time, a balanced Budget for 2005. I hope that this can be done on the basis of the proposals as they are now before us. I assume that they are a sound basis. I know we do not see eye to eye on every issue, and that is why we are looking forward to the debate. I am convinced that, as in the past, we will reach a mutually agreeable resolution in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Garriga, ladies and gentlemen, budgets always involve a tight and busy work schedule, and it is therefore entirely typical that an important budget debate should take place at the first normal plenary session of the new Parliament. It is the debate on the budget for 2005, or what will be the enlarged Union’s first full budget year, and above all the first budget to be debated and adopted by 25 Member States, and adopted by MEPs from 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities for this budget are clear to the Commission. Firstly, the integration of the new Member States must be promoted. Secondly, the forces of growth within the Community and cohesion in the enlarged Union must be strengthened. We should live up to our heightened responsibility in the world, and unfortunately we have no choice but to place the fight against terrorism at the very top of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have presented the key elements of the Council’s draft budget and the outcome of the Council’s first reading. I would like to go over the key figures of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget once again. We had proposed a budget volume for 2005 of EUR 109.5 billion, which would correspond to 1.03% of the gross national product of the enlarged Union. Agenda 2000, which is the current Financial Perspective, provides for a much higher figure for the 2005 budget year, namely 1.08% of combined economic output. If you also take into account the fact that the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget and must be funded in addition, an actual figure of 1.11% is reached for financial programming for 2005. I mention this now because a decision must be taken on whether the Commission’s proposals for the next period are really such a dramatic increase. The figure of 1.11% in financial programming should therefore be compared with our proposal of 1.14% for 2007 and following years.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are not talking about financial programming for the immediate future, but about the 2005 Budget, which is the first to include direct aid to farmers in the new Member States. This is a result of the time lag which exists in the field of agriculture, whereby expenditure takes place one year later. This is therefore the first time that direct aid to farmers in the new Member States is contained in the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a very sharp rise in overall expenditure on agriculture for 2005, of a total of EUR 4 - 4.5 billion according to the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, and EUR 3.5 billion even according to the Council’s draft budget. This is mainly due to enlargement, but I must point out that EUR 240 million of the increase is entirely attributable to changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate. Most importantly, the effect of the decisions made by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on agricultural reform will not be to reduce expenditure on agriculture next year, but to increase it. We must therefore also take the Council’s decisions into account, and of course I am emphasising this in the context of the comments that are often made to the effect that it is only the Commission and Parliament that propose increases in this area. We are often forced to incorporate the Council’s decisions into the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is now proposing a EUR 1 billion reduction in spending on agriculture, although it remains to be seen whether this can be put into practice. As always, we will present updated estimates for agricultural expenditure in October, and it is then usually agreed that the new estimates should be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I must now go into a little more detail with regard to the Structural Funds. The Commission has proposed a considerable increase in payment appropriations for 2005, as well as an increase in commitment appropriations. The Council has not made any cuts to commitment appropriations, and indeed it cannot do so, as everything in this area has been laid down, on the one hand by Agenda 2000 and on the other by the accession treaties. No changes can therefore be made to commitment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of how many payment appropriations we will need next year, the Council believes that we can make do with EUR 3 billion less than the figure proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I must however point out that in 2005 we will be in the sixth year of the new programme, and we need more payment appropriations because the implementation of Structural Funds programmes is finally in full swing.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years there have indeed been repeated instances where Member States themselves have overestimated their capacities to use structural funds. This year, however, it appears that they have underestimated their own capacities, and at any rate we currently have a significantly higher implementation rate for structural funds than last year. By late August we had already spent 67% of funds, whereas last year the figure was only 44%, and this has meant that my fellow-Commissioner Mr Barrot has already asked for additional funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming weeks we will examine whether reallocations are possible within the Budget, but at least one thing is clear, and I must make this perfectly plain to the Council: either we need additional funding before the end of 2004, or we must make sure that sufficient funds are provided in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simply out of the question for cuts to be made in this field. The n+2 rule, of which you are also aware, means that we must make sure that the Budget contains sufficient funds to cover requests for payment as they are made. In view of this development, I can only agree with Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Garriga, who has also stated clearly in his report that we must use the figures of the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to comment very briefly on the debate that was recently opened on whether structural funds should be cut for new Member States which lower their company tax rates considerably. In response to this, I can only stress that this proposal is unacceptable, and really quite unjustified. Firstly, with the exception of advance payments, no structural funds have been received by the new Member States. Secondly, each new Member State will have to contribute cofinancing in order to claim any structural funds at all. In principle, this means that the need for national public funds has increased rather than been reduced. This is something that we must also take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is in any case impossible to simply compare tax rates without taking into account the width of the tax base used in calculations. Many reforms in the new Member States have in fact been aimed at removing exemptions from the tax base, or rather at closing tax loopholes. All these issues must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the new Member States need help to enable them to bridge the large economic gap. We should not start to question the spirit of solidarity, which has always been a cornerstone of the European Union and must continue to be one, only a few months after enlargement, which was such a wonderful historical event.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to internal policies, I would particularly like to emphasise a point which is always important for Parliament with regard to the pilot projects and preparatory actions. I can assure Parliament that we are in the process of improving dialogue between the Commission and Parliament on this issue, and we will shortly provide you with an update on their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as foreign policy is concerned, the available budget is currently undergoing a reduction in real terms as a result of the provisions of Agenda 2000. Not only, though, is there the political will to jointly take on more responsibility in the world, but we are also, in fact, constantly faced with new challenges. In the past few years we have always, in our budgets, managed to find the right responses to challenges, and I am optimistic and confident that we will also succeed in doing so in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past few years we have had to make use of the flexibility instrument on several occasions, and I believe that this will continue to be the case in 2005. Since the Commission submitted the preliminary draft budget, the Council, and in particular the European Council, has taken further political decisions with implications for the Budget. These include, firstly, the political decision to open accession negotiations with Croatia, which will affect the Budget, and, secondly, the quite justified political decision to provide financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community. That, too, of course, will affect the Budget. According to the Commission proposal, both decisions will have implications for heading 7, pre-accession aid, but also for heading 4, where more funds will also need to be released.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, in the next few weeks, submit letters of amendment on the 2005 preliminary draft budget to Parliament and the Council regarding this issue, and I hope that this will enable us to reach a positive decision both on heading 7 and on heading 4, external policy expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also optimistic with regard to administrative expenditure. This still has to be negotiated, but in recent years it has been possible to achieve compromise, and this will also be the case for next year. I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that use of the flexibility instrument for administrative expenditure should be out of the question. We must therefore make every effort to find the necessary funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I was of course pleased on behalf of the Commission at the Council’s proposal to allow the Commission 680 extra posts next year for enlargement. Yet at the same time you have not granted the funds necessary to pay the new staff, which means that we would be forced to introduce a new European Volunteer Service in the Commission. I am not sure the trade unions and others would agree to this, and we must therefore continue to strive towards the provision of appropriate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the key figures: the Council is proposing a budget of EUR 116 billion for commitment appropriations and of EUR 105 billion for payment appropriations, which means a discrepancy of EUR 11 billion. I refer to this again because a number of Members have said in the debate on the next Financial Perspective that the Commission was allowing for too large a discrepancy, whereas the one we have proposed is in fact smaller than that in the Council’s preliminary draft budget. Further debate will be necessary on this issue. I also hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will not conduct the 2005 budget debate along ideological lines with regard to the 1.0% issue. The Dutch are well known, and rightly so, for acting in a very pragmatic and realistic manner, and I hope we will draw up a Budget which makes the necessary funding available for Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s first reading will take place in late October, and I am glad that the debate on the reading will be one of my last official duties. In the meantime, we will of course devote a great deal of energy to achieving another firm basis for a good compromise on the 2005 budget.</p>

Not only is this the first full annual budget for an EU of 25 Member States and a new European Commission, as well as for basic European institutions whose composition has been changed or adjusted as a result of enlargement, from the Court of Justice to the Ombudsman, it is also the first year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, our work will continue to be characterised by continuity, on the basis of the formal and informal rules of negotiation introduced by our predecessors. This is therefore the right time and place to pay tribute to our predecessors’ achievements, as the last parliamentary term was extremely productive. Parliament established its position as an equal arm of the EU’s budgetary power and as an equal participant in the EU’s budgetary procedure, and the credit for this should go to our predecessors, in particular to Terence Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as continuing our work on the 2005 budget this year, we must heed the message from the European elections. Many voters gave us a clear message by not voting in these elections. There is an increasing need for an easy—to-understand added value obtained with taxpayers’ money, as well as for transparency and rationality in budget expenditure and for an appropriate channelling of funds to tasks which will bring visible benefits both to local communities and to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in the context of one of the votes that took place earlier today, on an amendment transferring the 2003 budgetary surplus of around EUR 5.5 billion into the 2004 budget. In real terms, however, and taking into account the previous amendments to the budget, the surplus amounted to over EUR 10 billion, which is equivalent to one tenth of the EU’s 2003 budget. This also means that financial programming, in the sense of well-defined financial resources for legislative tasks and initiatives, remains an important task for the coming years of this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">It should come as no surprise that as someone from behind the former Iron Curtain I will be sensitive to the budgetary situation of the new Member States, and of course these Member States can already speak up for themselves. The aspirations of around 80 million people should not be limited and reduced to monetary transfers. I am however aware of the thoroughness with which Council and Commission proposals are examined in Warsaw, Prague, Tallinn and other cities, for example the proposal to make savings of around 3 billion zloty under the Structural Funds, or to reduce the funding for agricultural subsidies. These proposals are being examined in the context of the provisions of the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I note with satisfaction that among the various savings there was no change to the funding allocated for enlargement of the EU to include Bulgaria and Romania. In budgetary terms this confirms the political will to see accession in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s view on the 2005 budget will emerge from the amendments currently being tabled, although of course it will not merely be the sum of these amendments. The deadline for the committees is tomorrow and that for the political groups is next week, in order to prepare for a first reading on 28 October of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">If one aspect were to be highlighted as characterising this debate, both in plenary and in the Committee on Budgets, it is a tone of aversion to the horizontal cuts carried out mechanically by the Council in various areas, above all in Headings 3, 4 and 5. This is due to concern over whether there will be sufficient funding for Parliament’s traditional priorities, as well as concern that the justifiable funding needs of the common foreign and security policy, for example, do not become an automatic problem, but a problem to be solved in the framework of all the financial commitments under Heading 4. In our opinion all these issues deserve a more individualised approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in view of the short initiation I have had into the EU’s budgetary matters, it is appropriate today for my comments to be restrained and economical, just like the EU’s budget. I would like to leave all remaining matters to the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like any political agreement reached following long talks amongst the governments of the 25 Member States, the result of its first reading is worthy of praise and consideration, but in our view entirely insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has taken a strictly accounting approach at first reading. If Parliament were to accept – and it is not going to accept – this view on the part of the Council in its current form, it would be a triumph of national accounting over European policy, and I do not believe this would be good either for the Union or for its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We European Members of Parliament are well aware of national budgetary difficulties resulting from insufficient economic growth, and we know that the Stability Pact imposes very clear rules with regard to controlling budgetary deficits. The figures are, however, clear: in recent years, national budgets have increased by 22% while over the same period the Community budget has increased by 9%. That is to say, the European Parliament is much more fertile ground for budgetary austerity and rigour than national parliaments themselves at times.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members of the European Parliament – including myself – know that Community policies have great added value in terms of growth and employment, in relation to Structural Funds, research and external cooperation, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We fear that the Council’s approach at first reading is simply to create artificial margins in categories which do not correspond either to the real needs of the Union or commitments to third parties, not even with the political will expressed each year in the budgetary vote in December.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, in order to issue a more reasoned opinion in relation to the European Parliament’s reaction to this draft from the Council, I would prefer to wait to receive the amendments approved in the competent committees and in the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to make a few further points. Firstly, as general rapporteur, I believe that the reduction of the ceilings in the categories must determine the Union’s budget. The European Commission had already incorporated this reduction into its draft preliminary budget and in general terms – though not in every respect – we agree with the Commission’s analysis. The margins created by the Commission in categories 3, 4 and 5 are politically much more realistic than the margins created by the Council, which is something of a paradox.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the situation of the agencies. It is time for the Council to accept an undeniable fact: the decentralised agencies need sufficient funds if they are to be implemented and to function properly. If the political decision is taken to create agencies, the political decision must be taken to maintain them. The Council’s position is inconsistent here, and I am prepared to propose innovative solutions for resolving once and for all this double political language between commitments and compliances.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the issue of payment appropriations. In order to keep below the 1% of the Union’s gross national product – so dear to certain Member States – the Council has cut EUR 4 300 million. Commitments still to be paid as of 31 July stand at EUR 122 000 million. In relative terms, the categories with the most RALs are, in this order, 7, 4 and 2, the latter being the largest in terms of volume.</p>
<p class="contents">Any responsible institution would want to put an end to this situation. The N+2 rule that the Commission mentioned was created to improve execution and to speed up the completion of projects. In order to absorb these RALs, payments should be increased rather than decreased, unless the aim is simply to make savings for national treasuries.</p>
<p class="contents">From the 2000 budget EUR 44 500 million has been returned to the Member States in unexecuted appropriations – more than the whole of the Structural Funds budget for 2005 – and that return must not be seen as a saving for anybody. Returning appropriations to the Member States because they have not been able to spend them means squandering the added value of spending on Community policies which have been approved in order to contribute to growth and employment in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first real budget with 25 Member States. The Union has more challenges to meet and more needs to cover than in previous years. Managing to do more with the money available than in other years is the responsibility of the three institutions and, naturally, my responsibility. I wish the dialogue between the three institutions every success and I would like to acknowledge the ability demonstrated so far by the Dutch Presidency.</p>

Moreover, it is a budgetary year in which reform of staffing and the reform of the financial management are making their mark on developments in all the EU institutions. Last but not least, it is a year in which there is a tight framework for administrative expenditure in accordance with the multiannual programming upon which the EU countries agreed in the financial perspectives, and you in fact said yourself, Mr Nicolaï, that expenditure area 5 is complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisional draft budget showed that there was no margin at all remaining. The framework had, in fact, been overstepped and, in its handling of the matter, the Council has implemented cutbacks that provide a margin. The savings have hit what we call the other institutions particularly hard, and that is something at which we want to look in detail in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s budget has not been touched by the Council because of what is termed the gentleman’s agreement. We each look after our own budget. The Council cut back a little on its own budget. I think it is transparently obvious, however, that the Council’s administrative budget has increased at a rate of almost 5% in relation to the budget for 2004, in which the overall increase for all the institutions is one of 3%. If, now, the Council thinks that savings should be made and a margin exist – and that is something with which I, in a way, agree – it would have been a nice touch if the Council had taken the lead and kept more back from its own budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us set that aside for the moment, however. The Council has made an overall cut of 1.5% to take account of the fact that we must be able to save because new technology has been introduced and because the institutions cooperate. I can, moreover, only agree that some money can be saved through cooperation between the institutions on the personnel side and in connection with the languages. It may at times, however, be easier for the large institutions than for the small ones to make savings. I think that is something we must look at, and we must, of course, also check carefully that interinstitutional cooperation pays dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to commend the Council for having this time been a little less rigid than it often appears and for having argued more strongly for the cut-backs that have been made. The Council has thus accepted the desired positions on enlargement and on new tasks but has, in return, cut back the amounts by 5%, as Mrs Schreyer pointed out. I do not know whether it is because people are supposed to work for free. I now also think that it is to take account of the fact that a number of the appointments are not progressing as quickly as expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Parliament’s budget for 2005, I can point out that it is also influenced by enlargement and by the reforms of staffing policy and of financial management, and we should also have liked to have seen a number of improvements to MEPs’ conditions. Parliament plans to conduct an information campaign concerning the draft Constitution, and account has been taken of this in the budget. We still do not know whether there will be a new Members’ Statute in 2005 but, on the basis of the signals we are getting, I think it right that we take account of it in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with all the other institutions, Parliament must ensure as cheap and efficient administration as possible but, as has emerged in the first round, Parliament’s budget will constitute 20% of the administrative expenditure in 2005. I think that, regarding the administrative expenditure, the Council and Parliament ought together to find a solution that ensures both a suitable margin and sensible conditions for the Commission and the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Even a minor reduction in the rate of increase of the budget may be quite damaging to some of the small institutions, especially those that are at the development stage. I am thinking, for example, of the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor. As part of a solution to the problem in expenditure area 5, I think we should consider whether we might transfer unused funds in the administration budgets to 2005 and if we might make payments in advance, so introducing some room for manoeuvre into the administrative budgets in 2005 and thus creating a margin; or, in other words, that we engage in what, in budgeting jargon, is called the frontloading of unused funds. That is a factor I think we should consider including in the negotiations. There are major problems in expenditure area 5, but I do not think they are so great that the Council and Parliament should not together be able to find a reasonable solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that at the end of your term of office we have reached this stage of cooperation, and I believe this also says something positive about our cooperation during the past five years. We will, however, have a suitable opportunity to pay tribute to this in October.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I would particularly like to address the President-in-Office of the Council, as the draft Budget submitted by the Council raises a number of questions to which serious answers must be given by both arms of the budgetary authority, and not, as I would like to make perfectly clear, by Parliament alone. The problems demand a joint solution, and the Council cannot evade its responsibility. Matters relating to agricultural policy have been touched upon, and the agricultural reform we have drawn up will be implemented as of 1 January 2005. This gives rise to corresponding obligations, and we need to fulfil the terms of the Treaty concluded with the new Member States in Copenhagen. It is no longer possible to act as though agricultural policy were a piggy bank under the sole control of the Council. All legal obligations which have been entered into must be fulfilled. As you well know, responsibility for this is yours and yours alone, and I would ask you to shoulder it.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true for structural policy. It is of course a fine thing for us to be discussing a new Financial Perspective now, when requests are being sent in by all the Member States for all these things to be funded. With specific regard to budget implementation, however, which the Commissioner is right to say has now improved, cuts to payments, meaning a current reduction in real terms, are not a policy that we can support. You should therefore also shoulder your responsibility in this respect, and not merely look at the figures, but also at whether the policies are correct, which, in the field of structural policy, they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that you have supported all agreements relating to the multiannual programmes and made no cuts to any of them. We will examine this very carefully, as we have our doubts with regard to certain matters, and you can be sure that we will take a very close look at these issues. It is particularly necessary to give new impetus to the agreements relating to enlargement negotiated by our rapporteur, Mr Böge, and I believe that it is also in our own interests that funding be provided for programmes for which we have legislated, such as youth exchanges and education, without going into too many details.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the subject of the agencies, and to ask whether you are shouldering your responsibility in this respect. It is my opinion that the Heads of State or Government played Santa Claus with each other and spread a large number of agencies throughout the continent, and now they must all be funded. I would ask you to take a moment to consider whether it is practical in the long term for all this to be done under heading 3. Wherever it is created, administration should be funded under the heading of administration. It is not sufficient for the Heads of State or Government to brag about the fantastic agencies they have obtained for their Member States; they must also ensure that appropriate funding is available so that we can do justice to this duty.</p>
<p class="contents">I only wish to say a few words on the issue of information policy; here, too, we will have serious things to say to the Commission, as it has refused to make the outcome of the Convention known to the general public. We must cooperate a little more closely on this issue if we genuinely wish to overcome the deficiencies which became obvious during the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as foreign policy is concerned, I am starting to wonder what is going on. Since 1999, or the 2000 budget, we have been faced with the problem that we cannot fund the commitments which the foreign ministers enter into in their never-ending donation frenzy. Once again – and I have lost count of the number of times it has done so already – the Commission is putting forward proposals relating to use of the flexibility instrument under heading 4, foreign policy. Your foreign minister policy is currently running on empty, and I would like to make it perfectly clear that this cannot be tolerated. We will be sure to keep an eye on this. I could also say something on the subject of Cyprus, but I will refrain from doing so, as I am running out of time and the President is already giving me a stern look.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to administrative expenditure, I will merely say that you cannot make cuts everywhere else and increase your own budget. That is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity, and we will not tolerate this either. I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and to everyone else; much remains to be done, and we must save money, but we must save in the right places so that Europe remains visible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Traditional it certainly is, and so, alas, are the Council’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, the Council has made very substantial cuts in the Commission’s preliminary draft Budget. Many times over, alas, we have had occasion to denounce such practices in your hearing, but today, at the outset of the debates on the financial perspectives, I think we have cause to be even more perturbed by this practice, for the Budget for the EU that the Council has put forward is an extremely restrictive one. In the preliminary draft Budget, we noted that there were significant increases in payments and commitments, which were necessary to the success of enlargement, and, now that we see these increases drastically curtailed, we know that the funding will not be there to enable the European Union to back up its promises.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the restrictions proposed by the Council quite unacceptable, and, as previous speakers have said, that is the case under all the headings. Let me just dwell on a few points; to take one example, on the incoherence involved in reducing payments to the Structural Funds: as they have been used up, we need money in order to be able to do what we have promised. Turning to heading 3, that of internal affairs, everyone rehearsed the role of the agencies and the problems inherent in communicating with the public. I will also consider the role of micro-businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises in creating employment and will have something to say about the inconsistency of the Council’s approach to twinning.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to build the European Union, the citizens have to meet each other, yet, over the six years that I have been here to debate the Budget, we have seen twinning links cut back, which amounts to denying the citizens any involvement and to implying that twinning itself is not important. We will again have to amend the drafts, terrible though that is as a way of going about things, because we are the ones who will have to do it and we will all be wasting time introducing this sort of amendment at a time when we should be pooling our resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the external actions. The Council’s draft Budget represents a tentative attempt at making economies in order to fund expenditure on Iraq, rather than on a truly ongoing vision of Europe’s external action. Less EUR 15 million for TACIS, less EUR 25 million for MEDA, less EUR 16 million for CARDS, less EUR 9 million for Latin America. Has poverty died out? Are there no more problems? Far from it, to be sure; what has changed is that the Commission is far better – and yes, it really is – at implementing its budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in fact, are keen that the Council should find other means of funding Iraq, and also that the EU should keep the promises it made to all the peoples concerned, as it does those it makes to its own citizens. Yet again, the Council has opted for an actuarial approach by seeking, as a matter of priority, to make savings on the revenue needed to balance the Budget. When preparing the preliminary draft budget, the Commission had asked for 1.03% of GNP and, as if by chance, the draft budget has 0.99%, less, you see, than the symbolic figure of 1% on which some rely in order to be able to cut back their national budget. It is perfectly clear what is going on: the figures have been adopted in an attempt to get a pseudo-draft accepted. Well, we, in this House, will go ahead and do the precise opposite. We want to start from the draft and from the promises made to the public, and, on that basis, produce a budget that is well funded and of use to all. It follows that we have to clarify what our plans for today’s Europe are, and set ourselves goals, rather than decide on an arbitrary figure. As we see it, Europe’s ambition must reflect that of the Heads of State at their summits.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a marked contradiction between what is said by Europe’s advocates and what is said by the Council. From the point of view of the Budget, it is impossible to achieve the goals that the EU has set itself with such paltry funding. We want growth in Europe, solidarity in Europe; we want more competitiveness and more of the Lisbon spirit; we want to make Europe homogeneous and prosperous, to see it consolidating its social model and its potential for growth, for land redistribution, for investment in research, for development, for funding great political and development projects. We will see to it that Parliament will honour its promises and the undertakings that the Council has been unable to include in its draft Budgets.</p>

The Commission decides on a preliminary draft budget, the Council compiles a draft budget and without knowing the figures, it can be taken as read that the Council will be making cutbacks in agricultural spending, and in all other budget categories, for that matter. A large proportion of agricultural spending is laid down by law.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always taken the view that the Commission is better equipped to determine precise spending than the Council, and that is why I think it is a good tradition on the part of Parliament to take the Commission more seriously than the Council in this area. In any event, we need to wait and see what, exactly, the letter of amendment at the end of October will contain. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe hope – and Parliament’s position on the 2005 Budget already partly reflects this – that two trial projects will be maintained. The first one concerns the possibility, in future, of reaching assurances against infectious animal diseases which can break out at some point in the future and will impact heavily on the agricultural budget. The second one must culminate in a system of quality assessment for European agricultural products. After all, it is difficult to justify farmers in Europe being increasingly obliged to compete with farmers elsewhere in the world, while farmers elsewhere in the world need not observe the same standards.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal can be said about the many budget categories. With regard to the structural funds, it is, in my view, of essential importance for the effect of the n+2 rule to be analysed very carefully and to be checked in relation to the estimates. If it transpires at this point that there are still large surpluses, it can be checked whether or not it is possible to make cutbacks. Without observing the order of the chapters of the budget, I should also like to say something about Category 5. In my view, by apportioning the highest rise to the Council itself, the Council has indeed been a little too generous where its own interests are concerned. It is, however, a good tradition for the Council and Parliament not to criticise each other’s budgets and to leave them intact.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think, though, that for a few years now, a new element has crept into the Council’s budget, namely spending for the common foreign and security policy. I wonder whether that is actually an administrative item of expenditure on the part of the Council. I do not think so. In my view, it is clearly a political activity which should be assessed as such, and Parliament should have more say in this, rather than merely receiving information, as it does at present. One final point: Parliament has initiated many trial projects on which the Commission should have reported at the beginning of September. That has not yet happened. Commissioner Schreyer could perhaps state the exact date when the list with the results of the trial projects and the preparatory actions will be produced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have heard, there is a consensus across all groups that we cannot accept the Council’s draft budget in its present form, and I would like to start by echoing Mr Lewandowski and the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, in saying that we must give pride of place to the concept of solidarity and the spirit of solidarity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard, the 2005 Budget is the first for 25 Member States, and budgetary allocations must therefore do justice to the new historical context, in which the division of our continent is finally being overcome. In our opinion the draft Budget as it stands does not measure up to this great European challenge, and I would like to go on to give a number of examples to make this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the European elections showed us that together we face a serious acceptance problem, and that we do not really get across to the public. It is therefore a mistake to make savings on information policy; on the contrary, this is an area in which we must be able to be pro-active in addressing our electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true for the cuts you have proposed for the European agencies, including those for food safety, environmental protection and maritime safety. Who exactly should pursue truly ecological policies in Europe, if not us? We therefore also consider these proposals for cuts to be inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the budget for culture. I very recently became the second Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, and after finding out that the entire budget for culture amounts to 1%, the equivalent of that for tobacco subsidies, I cannot believe that this does justice to our continent, which aspires, after all, to be the continent of culture and the arts.</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly the same is true with regard to the opportunities available to us to further reduce the traditional role of farming subsidies. If we really want to make a success of the Lisbon strategy, or in other words the economic reconstruction and renewal of Europe, we must increase our margins for manoeuvre. Investments in youth and intelligence are the real resources of the future, and we must work on these tasks together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore also like to make it clear that, in our opinion, the letter from the six Heads of Government who wish to fix the budget at 1% in the Financial Perspective is a mistake. This would not allow us to meet new challenges. Corrections must be made, and we will also push for this in our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This amount has been available to the Commission; it has not spent it in the manner intended for the budgetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not come up to expectations in 2003. The Commission did not come up to expectations in the years prior to that. The Commission will not come up to expectations next year either. We know that not all of the budget funds will be spent next year either and that next autumn the contributions paid into the EU’s coffers will once again be refunded to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is to blame when the budget, which has been approved by the Council and the European Parliament, is not fully implemented? Not just the Commission, but also the Member States are to blame for the outstanding commitments that have resulted from underutilisation of the Structural Funds. Not all Member States draft their programmes in the proper way or in accordance with the proper timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other sections of the budget, the accusing finger must be pointed at the Commission in the first instance. The Commission neither wishes, for political reasons, nor is able, due to organisational shortcomings, to fully implement the budget. Consequently, the preparation of the Union’s budget for next year will in many respects be a form of shadow boxing involving three parties. The Commission will put on a show of proposing appropriations, which it neither wishes, nor will be able, to spend. The Council will pretend to be satisfied with the savings made, if they are not connected with its priorities. The European Parliament will make a show of struggling against the maximum amounts, or ceilings, for each section recorded in the financial framework. Everyone, however, will know that there is more money actually available than is needed and that it will once again be refunded to the Member States at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group takes a critical view of the cuts that are being made in other appropriations under the section headed external action in favour of the Council’s priority, the reconstruction of Iraq. This means that the other priorities that Parliament considers important will not be addressed. Iraq is the new pretext for failing to fully implement next year’s budget, to be approved in Parliament. As a result, we are fulfilling certain countries’ objective of implementing a ceiling of 1% of GNP in the budget. This budget is a step in that direction.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish, in this House today, to take the opportunity to state what we consider should be the main trends forming the basis of EU strategy on financial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The overarching principle should first of all be that the EU’s total budget expenditure should not exceed one per cent of the EU countries’ combined GDP. We thus support the position adopted by the governments of a number of countries, including Sweden’s. The ceiling on expenditure should apply not only to the forthcoming budget year, 2005, but also apply in the long term. With a credible, restrictive ceiling on expenditure, it will be possible to counter the views of critics who fear that the EU is developing into an all too dominant superstate. We do not believe that the EU should commit itself to far-reaching transfers between countries and regions. Experience shows that such transfer systems have a bad effect on long-term growth.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the fact that a number of countries now pay significantly more than what they get back in the form of subsidies. The net contribution should not, therefore, exceed roughly 0.4% of a country’s GDP. Each country should thus be able to refrain from receiving subsidies and so be able to reduce its total gross contribution to the EU. Such a system would make things significantly easier from an administrative point of view. The work involved in applying for subsidies at present uses up a lot of resources that could be used more productively.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we reject the idea that the EU should procure its own resources by imposing taxes or duties upon us. It is only for national parliaments to deduct taxes and duties. Nor, with a strict ceiling on expenditure, would the EU’s own resources afford scope for increased expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point is that all the Member States should pay the same gross charge as a percentage of GDP. The special exemptions that exist must be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that the EU must have a budgeting margin within the framework of the ceiling on expenditure so that the EU can act quickly in crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to emphasise that the EU must not promise subsidies for which there is no scope in terms of the ceiling on expenditure. Discussions of EU enlargement must be based upon realistic analyses of the economic consequences of enlargement. New commitments, programmes and promises of subsidies may only be honoured within the framework of the reallocation of old appropriations. A review of agricultural aid may, in the longer term, create scope for aid to countries with the weakest economies. We shall vote on the forthcoming draft budget in accordance with these intentions. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this complies with the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006, it is not in line with the EU’s general philosophy. It means the enlarging European Union is limiting the extent to which its funds can be redistributed, in relative terms. In so doing, it is limiting its opportunities for development, assuming funds are still used with the same efficiency. Yet at the same time, by making reference to the Lisbon Strategy, for example, the EU continues to aspire to a growing role in the global economic race. In our opinion this is not a coherent policy, as it effectively consists of stepping on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. In view of our Danish colleague’s reservations, the entire UEN Group rejects the Council’s proposed payment cuts, and calls for an increase, not a decrease, in payments as a percentage of GDP in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction in payments proposed by the Council under Heading 2 is greater than that under Heading 1. In general this demonstrates the Council’s pessimism, or even distrust, concerning the Member States’ ability to make use of funds, especially the new Member States. This also means a change in terms of ratios, to the disadvantage of development funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The reductions in payments proposed by the Council under Headings 1 and 2 are of a plainly mechanical nature, and the fact that they are all round figures is worthy of attention. In this connection, the UEN Group supports the inclusion of the figures proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to a third and more minor point, with regard to the growing importance of the EU’s neighbours, and with this morning’s debate on Belarus very much in mind, the UEN Group is opposed to limiting expenditure on the TACIS and MEDA programmes, while at the same time insisting that the way in which these funds are spent must be monitored closely. In order to promote both the values upon which the EU is based and our own safety, we should support trends conducive to building the rule of law in neighbouring countries. Little will be achieved by cutting funding for these aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Fifteen have now not only invaded the markets to a considerable extent but also taken over companies in the less advanced countries, thus producing not inconsiderable amounts of revenue. The new Member States of the European Union therefore now justifiably expect a welcoming hand and not the construction of barriers to the movement of labour, nor administrative barriers to the provision of post-accession aid and certainly not a reduction in budgetary resources in the field of structural operations and equalisation of regional disparities.</p>

It is the first time that you lead in Czech and I, for the first time in this House, can speak in Hungarian, my mother tongue. It was not easy to create the opportunity for this but it is also not easy to create the harmony between the requirements and the possibilities in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that this harmony can be better realised in the budget previously submitted by the Commission than in the one submitted to us by the Council. It is particularly important in two areas that Parliament should accept the opinion of the European Commission. One is the issue of the agricultural support where, according to Council, next year’s available sums would be decreased by EUR 1 billion. This reduction also applies to sums they committed themselves to previously.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem has already been mentioned by several speakers: it is the issue of the EUR 3 billion reduction in the annual payment of the structural funds in 2005. The initial proposal of the European Commission was well-founded. It took into consideration the framework of the previous financial plan and also the fact that the absorption capacity of the Member States is continuously growing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore justified that Parliament should stand by the Commission’s proposal <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Council. We should, however, make our repayments from the EUR 3 billion in such a way that each Member State receives a share of the surplus. It is reasonable that the new Member States should not receive empty words only from solidarity, nor be restricted in their movement to the narrow confines of the Copenhagen framework. This proposal is based on the same principles upon which this House based last year’s 12% payment increase for the year 2004 for the ten new Member States. Let us show solidarity with those Member States who have a harder task of joining up than others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We might say that the enlarged EU is starting to work to an established routine. The budget is also the first of this Parliament and the newly appointed Commission, and so it reflects the essence of an entirely new EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The total payment appropriations in the budget come to EUR 105 billion; that is, 0.99% of GNP, or approximately EUR 9 billion below the financial perspective ceiling. The proposal is therefore very stringent. This has been achieved by cutting agricultural expenditure by EUR 1 billion and structural financing by EUR 3 billion, which should be regarded as questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget has now once again been drafted on an activity-based structure, increasing its transparency. At the same time, it clarifies personal accountability for administration and facilitates comparison of the efficiency of different administrative branches. This is a first-rate, liberalising improvement and it shows that the EU too is capable of major reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Outstanding commitments remain the biggest problem with the EU budget. These will rise to EUR 112 billion by the end of this year. Most of it has to do with the Structural Funds. For example, last year EUR 8 134 000 000 in budgeted payment appropriations in the Structural Funds went unused. The result of this will be that, over the coming years, an ever larger proportion of the Structural Funds will be used to meet old commitments. Finally, I would like to say that this draft budget drawn up by the Council will require some substantial revision by Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Has there ever been a great human endeavour that took such a wretched figure as its basis? To what ambition do these long speeches testify, when there are reductions here, cutbacks there, and restrictions somewhere else?</p>
<p class="contents">Like everyone else in this House, I am of course in favour of budgetary rigour, but that rigour is already subject to the ceilings imposed by the financial perspectives and we are falling short of the current ceilings by some EUR 5 billion. Five billion! Can the Council even begin to imagine what that means? Social needs are beginning to make themselves felt. Could we not alleviate the effects of rapid enlargement on environmental standards? Could a start not be made on transposing the dozens and dozens of directives? Where democracy is concerned – and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – the Prince programme has been cut into three. There is more. As previous rapporteurs have said, the Council has evidently not heard of such terms as ‘added value’, ‘economy of scale’ or ‘financial synergy’. The Constitution is supposed to be the motor of the EU, but I think it needs some fuel before we tackle this Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If the budget is, without doubt, an accounting exercise, it is equally certain that it is also a political one. I do not get the impression that the Council has grasped that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It strengthens the reactionary character and militarisation of the European Union. This is being achieved by further drastic cutbacks in social benefits and by transferring appropriations in order to strengthen the military arm of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is anti-grass roots, because it is predicated on promoting the Lisbon strategy and stepping up the attack on workers' employment and social rights. Money is being taken from small and medium-sized farmers, with the result that they are being exterminated and entire areas are being abandoned and deserted. It does not take account of the needs generated by enlargement in ten countries and it calls on workers, women, young people, small- and medium-sized farmers, trades and handicrafts, the working classes in the less developed areas in all twenty-five Member States, to foot the bill for the creation of an attractive business environment for big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The package of social appropriations which many are promising is proving to be a myth for the workers. The social budget is dynamic, but it supports the financially strongest, big business, and the means and mechanisms for repressing the fight of the financial weak, the grass-roots, working classes. Unfortunately, however many amendments are made, they will not change the reactionary character of the budget, which is why we shall be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am surprised that the Council has come up with those proposals.

<p class="contents">There are two solutions available to you: the first is to dismantle the CAP after 2013 in order to recover the best part of 44% of agricultural funds, a development that has been in the pipeline ever since the CAP was refashioned. The second, given that it is inevitable that the budget will double, is to create a European tax to fund it. It will be the European Constitution that will make these two solutions possible. With codecision, we will be able to calmly do away with the CAP, and, in due course, with our small farmers. In any case, simple majority means we could end up with a European budget of double the size and the imposition of a European business tax, or even a European income tax. As I expect to have to pay it, I would like to savour these last moments of not being pestered by the taxman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His annual report said not a word about the EU's own accounting system, which has been shown to be structurally fraudulent and lacks financial cohesion. It can never comply with even the minimum standards required by the EU itself of companies all over Europe. Dr Brüner failed to address any of the critically important issues of institutionalised malpractice identified in this organisation by experienced accountants. Basic financial records are not being kept; double-entry bookkeeping is still not the norm; cash and bank balances are still not being reconciled, nor are budgets and expenses; advances are recorded as expenditure, which is fraudulent; loans which disappear are written off, which is both a loss of public funds and tax fraud; and records of assets and liabilities in past years are changed retrospectively, which is also fraudulent.</p>
<p class="contents">I put it to Dr Brüner at that meeting: 'If you are not investigating this disgraceful situation, then who is?' and I got no answer.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Council.</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, may I start by extending warm congratulations to you, Mr Ouzký, on your first appearance here as Vice-President of the European Parliament. I am very indebted to you and your Members for the many interesting remarks as well as remarks concerning content that have been made. I have also heard many critical and anxious comments from you. I think that that is the start of an interesting debate which we will be continuing later on in the year. I should like to give a first reaction to a number of important remarks, although I will have to keep it brief.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Lewandowski may well have started off with one of the most fundamental remarks when he made reference to what the citizens of Europe expect from us and from this budget – just look at the latest European parliamentary elections – and he mentioned the, to my mind, central concept of ‘added value’. This is the very thing which the Council is trying to achieve: by means of this budget, to give substance to the added value which Europe can have, the added value compared to what is happening elsewhere, to what is happening nationally, in the best possible way. Nevertheless, judging from his comments, he and the Council do not agree on every score on the question as to how this added value should be viewed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that added value is primary for European citizens, or that the highest possible level of funding is brought into Europe and subsequently returned to those citizens for good causes. I think that the greatest concern, though, where the added value of citizens in Europe is concerned, is the fact that this is being handled at European level, rather than it being organised at a lower level nationally or otherwise. That is in any event a guideline for us, the Council, with regard to this budget, and it also says something about what is not on the agenda now but has been mentioned by a few of your Members, namely the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with Mr Lewandowski when he suggests that we, in our proposals – the Council’s draft proposal compared to the Commission’s proposals – would have mainly used the ‘cheese slicer method’, as we put it in the Netherlands, that we would have made use of generic cutbacks across the line. I think that, chiefly, we have made choices in this budget, in respect of which you can beg to differ, but they are at least choices, and they have by no means been easy choices for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Garriga made an interesting observation with his comparison between the increase of national budgets over a number of years and the increase of the European budget. His position was that, in that light, the European budget increases had been far lower than the national budget ones over a number of years. If you look into this in more detail, I agree that this can also lead to a different insight. Indeed, the last few years, particularly since the economic recession from 2000 onwards, give a totally different picture of the national budget. Suffice to mention the discussion about the Stability Pact for you to know what I mean.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in response to the – in itself very interesting – comparison that Mr Garriga made, I should like to say that the national governments naturally have responsibilities which the European Union does not have and which are linked to increases, such as social security, health care and education. That is a completely different budget from the European budget where agricultural spending still accounts for nearly half of the budget and structural policy spending for nearly 30%. I should like to vehemently deny the general criticism levelled by a number of your Members, to the effect that the Council had acted as an accountant. I would, in fact, claim the opposite, because we have definitely not acted as accountants, but as politicians, as politically responsible, by making choices that were, as I said before, not easy to make. I can obviously only applaud the fact that we in the Council act counter to your views and, as Mrs Trüpel stated, are dealing with a very independent Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I cannot resist saying that in my view, politics is not only about formulating priorities, but also always about having the nerve to formulate posteriorities, and we as politicians know that, in general, that is more difficult than anything else, but it is, in my view, necessary in order to be able to reach financial prioritisation. In that sense, I hope that some of your Members have not suggested any kind of opposition here where the responsibility is concerned which we, as legs of the budgetary authority, you as Parliament and we as Council, feel for all citizens of Europe, whereby we as Council give due consideration to the economic situation of a recession, the fact that choices must definitely be made and the fact that we largely view this added value, as stated in a reaction to Mr Lewandowski’s speech, as part of the added value of European efforts compared to national efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to an example that Mrs Trüpel quoted, namely that the enormous importance of culture and of cultural policy does not mean that this should be dealt with at European level. It is not the case, in my view, that the more important an area is, the more European it should be. What is still at issue is at what level added value can be provided most effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to flag a few essential points mentioned by speakers on your side. Let me start with the remark made by Commissioner Schreyer, and indeed a number of your Members have mentioned this point, namely structural funds, and the communication which Commissioner Schreyer made, that the level of depletion is positively higher than could previously be assumed. In fact, she also mentioned the discussion about company tax and her objection to a link being made between that discussion and the structural policy discussion. Let me state emphatically that, firstly, we are obviously awaiting the further Commission proposal on this subject and secondly, this Council and this presidency abide by their guiding principle, and will do so in future, namely that we leave expenditure for the new Member States intact and equally, that we leave the agreements that have been struck on this subject in Copenhagen intact.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to payment appropriations, a number of you have already drawn our attention to them, understandably so, particularly Mr Garriga who was the first to do so. He was also the first to level critical remarks with regard to the proposals on the part of the Council concerning those of the Commission, but I gather that he has already had a response in a way, even if unintended, by Mr Seppänen, I hope I pronounce your name correctly, who noted that before 2003, five billion was returned, and I can assure him and you, Mr President and fellow Members, that five billion has been returned before. If we talk about returns to the tune of ten billion, then I think that this puts a slightly different complexion on the remark about payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you were right to mention the importance of new priorities, new countries and solidarity. That is why I set such great store by this emphatic statement not to meddle with agreements and the just expectations that are nurtured in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you, including Mr Ferber and Mr Mulder, mentioned the subject of agriculture. Here again, the same applies, and I should like to hammer my message home once more: it goes without saying that agreements or farmers’ and cultivators’ rights are not tampered with. As Mr Mulder said quite rightly, we will be receiving the latest figures in October, but we will always fulfil our obligation in this respect. A number of you, including Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen, have also flagged the agencies as an area of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">For a moment, I was reminded of the fact that earlier last year, the European Parliament was, in fact, concerned about extra spending for those agencies, and Parliament now appears to be anxious, at least for a number of hours, about not having enough funding. Certainly where the new agencies are concerned, I think that we have tabled a very solid proposal for the activities of those agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The flexibility instrument has been mentioned, mainly in connection with the importance of external policy. You will agree with me that the core of the flexibility instrument is that it accommodates unexpected and unforeseen circumstances, and does not, therefore, provide for matters that can be planned ahead. I think it is crucial, and also in everyone’s interest, if we were to keep this instrument for that purpose and not deploy the flexibility instrument in the way as it was proposed earlier for external policy, being the entire category, the entire external policy in respect of which Mr Lewandowski and others made critical and anxious comments. I share their anxieties to a certain degree, because we did not enjoy making cutbacks in this category, even less in this one than in other categories, given the responsibility which we as Europe, and I very much agree with the comments that have been made, increasingly have in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, as you have seen, we have made important exceptions in our proposal to this cutback, the key priority, of course, being ‘Iraq’ and the common foreign and security policy in general. I should like to put this into perspective to some degree, because if you consider the development of this budget over the last few years, there is an enormous increase in this very category.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, some MEPs have made comments, direct or indirect, about the new financial perspectives. I will not go into any more detail because fortunately, we have an informal meeting after this session to talk this over with your coordinators of all groups in this Parliament, as we have also agreed in the conciliation to inform you in the correct manner, but let me make one comment in this respect, because a number of your Members have mooted this point, the 1% letter, the approach of this presidency. Rest assured, we may be here as Dutch people, but we are not acting on our own behalf but as the Presidency of the European Union, which means that it is our responsibility to make the best possible progress in reaching agreement in the Council, at least where the principles and guidelines for the following multi-annual budget at the end of this year are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we as presidency have precisely opted for an approach which steers clear of being proven right or wrong about the 1%, and which moves into the direction of the discussion as to where our priorities and, I should like to add, our posteriorities are. I should like to take this opportunity to say this in reaction to comments. In this way, we hope to establish what is termed a ‘building blocks’ approach, an open discussion on content, just as, in fact, a start has already, in my view, been made with your Parliament today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to ask the penultimate speaker to note that our external auditor is not a company, but an independent and autonomous European institution, the European Court of Auditors, which audits accounting methods, the revenue and expenditure account and the statement of financial position annually, and concludes each year that the accounts are reliable. It then makes a number of comments, but without altering the overall result, and this makes it particularly clear that the accounts comply with the EU’s rules. With regard to implementation of the Budget, which in principle is now also connected with the accounts, I would like to point out once again that Parliament, like the Council, receives implementation figures for the EU Budget every week.</p>
<p class="contents">No other parliament in the Member States is so well informed, and of course one of the reasons I introduced this practice is that you need to be aware, in particular for the budget debate, of the state of implementation of the individual programmes so that a decision can be taken on the correct approach for the coming year. It is apparent that the implementation rate for expenditure under the Structural Funds has drastically accelerated this year. This is not only because we have been able to make the first advance payments to the new Member States, but in particular because of the continuing payments to the old Member States for the 2000-2006 programmes. It follows that further intensive debate on this issue with the Council is needed, as there is absolutely no point in putting too little money in the Budget and having to submit a supplementary Budget later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder specifically asked me when we would forward information on the pilot projects and preparatory actions to the Committee on Budgets. We hope to achieve this by 15 September, but we require information from many of the Directorates-General; we will have forwarded the information by 20 September at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this debate on the 2005 Budget was a very lively one. I would like to express my thanks for this on behalf of the Commission, and I believe that it is right for us to show such commitment in this debate, as there are undoubtedly many citizens who will be keen to see what the first Budget for the enlarged Union, and adopted by an enlarged Union, will look like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
