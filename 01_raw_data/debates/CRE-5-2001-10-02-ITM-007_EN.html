<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its meeting today, the College of Commissioners adopted a proposed review of the trans-European transport networks, as well as the review of the Financial Regulation, which allows for a doubling of the Community funding in these projects, up to a level of 20% of those projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The trans-European transport network has been the backbone of our internal market since it was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht and, thanks to the guidelines which we jointly adopted in 1996, the European Union has a structure of networks of European interest which allows the interconnection of our regions and aids the mobility of people and goods.</p>
<p class="contents">These trans-European networks are Europe’s first attempt since Roman times to treat its infrastructures in a truly global and integrated fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">The review we are proposing today attempts to update the development of this system and add new priority projects which respond to the problems of the challenges which our common transport policy has raised in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of transport systems and the increase in demand for mobility have caused an imbalance between the different modes of transport and have contributed to the creation of bottlenecks in certain areas of our infrastructures. Both the Gothenburg Summit and the Transport White Paper adopted on 12 September have identified these failings and have demanded that the Commission implement urgent measures to overcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s proposal, the Commission recommends including amongst the priority projects, as well as the so-called Essen projects, eight new rail, combined transport, inland waterways and intelligent transport – specifically the GALILEO project – networks and withdrawing three of the initial projects which have now been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The new projects would be: first, a rail crossing for the Pyrenees which would overcome the natural obstacle which separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the high speed train, East-west combined transport, from Paris to Vienna, which will later be extended to Budapest and will complete our network by opening the door to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the navigability of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which will connect the North Sea to the Black Sea, thereby improving the interconnection between the Danube and the Rhine.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the GALILEO satellite positioning system, which has been recognised as a priority by successive European Councils and by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, the road connection between Germany and Denmark via Fehmarn according to the Oresund model, which will improve interconnection between the Nordic countries and the rest of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth, the high speed rail interoperability of the Iberian network, by adapting it to the track gauge of the rest of the European continent, which will ease sky and land congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventh, the extension of the Brenner project from Munich to Verona, as far as Naples, adding the Bologna-Milan line.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighth, the extension of the high speed train south as far as Nîmes, which provides a connection between the north and south of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary global investment for these projects, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will amount to more than EUR 66 000 million which must clearly be financed essentially through national, regional, private, public and also, where necessary, Community funds. Geographically, they involve the whole of our territory and they will have a decisive impact on the competitiveness of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This review also includes in the trans-European networks certain minor technical modifications of existing projects which were left outstanding after the conciliation of the package of guidelines in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Transport White Paper, we committed ourselves to this review, which is the most urgent priority, being followed in 2004 by another which will include in more detail the projects of the new countries of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, it would be premature to do so now since, despite the preparatory work, which has made good progress, there is a lack of important information which we will only be able to obtain during the final phase of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament will therefore examine the next review and this is a political commitment which I reconfirm to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am very pleased to fulfil through this work the mandates of the Council and the new requirements of our common transport policy. Now that the White Paper and the review of the trans-European networks have been presented, I trust and hope, within the framework of codecision, that this Parliament will make its contributions, the added value of which is evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I know that, while this has been approved today by the Commission, there are currently other topical realities, specifically the consequences for the airline industry of the events of 11 September, which you will possibly be concerned about. Of course, I will answer any question which you may ask me on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months. The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999. We thank you for presenting it now.</p>
<p class="contents">So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on – such as the Brenner Tunnel – now at last being finished. I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built?</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel? Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said. I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p class="contents">One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament. Might we perhaps put this experience to use? In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support. The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind. For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds – for example the Cohesion Fund and others – will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency. Those are my two questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder whether the latter actually falls within the scope of such a thing as establishing trans-European networks. I can understand why its repair would come under its scope, in a manner of speaking, for there is already a link there at the moment. That was my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has become increasingly clear to me that with regard to links within the candidate countries, requests are mainly made for north-south links, and not only for east-west links from Europe and beyond. My question is therefore whether there are currently any plans to set up more north-south links in the present candidate countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I will reply to Mr Jarzembowski.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me extremely urgent that we present to Parliament and the Council a new system of charging for infrastructures and, in particular, a modification of the current ‘Euro-disc’ directive with regard to the funding of road infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this proposed new funding of infrastructures we will undoubtedly consider, amongst other things, that infrastructures should meet not only the costs of their own maintenance or construction, but also the so-called external costs, in accordance with the Costa report which was approved by this Parliament. We are talking about costs such as congestion, accidents and certain environmental costs, which are clearly definable and quantifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in this proposal we will introduce the possibility that in certain cases – I insist, not as a habitual system, but in certain exceptional cases such as the Brenner tunnel or certain large projects which involve very costly work with a significant environmental impact that must be reduced as far as possible – the so-called Swiss model may be applied in the European Union as well, that is to say that tolls, or part of a toll from an existing infrastructure be used to create a fund to finance the construction of an alternative rail infrastructure. This is a fundamental issue. It is by means of these formulae that we hope the most important projects for the structuring of the whole of European territory may be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are going to analyse the projects that appear here in the codecision procedure. I wish to say that the fact the project appears in the trans-European networks allows the European Union to promote the idea that States – who in the end have to make the great investments – or regions should also plan their large-scale works not on the basis of national interest, but in the interest of trans-European interconnection and hence with a cross-border vision. This is why I said that, since Roman times, the trans-European networks initiative is really the first rational proposal of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be made possible by providing co-funding, up to a current maximum of 10%. If the proposals being made here are approved this may go up to 20% for certain particularly important and costly projects, because appearing on these trans-European networks eases access to funding by the European Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I will say to Mr Bouwman that, in this new proposal, we incorporate not only the North-south routes, which are the ones that have essentially been included in the other trans-European networks, because they were the most necessary, but also the East-west routes, above all the basic Paris-Stuttgart-Vienna route, which will eventually provide a link with Budapest; we also incorporate the Danube and its best communication with the Rhine, creating a south-east-northeast route which crosses the whole of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the 2004 review, when the new countries of the Union will also be integrated, will stress this East-west component even more, without forgetting the North-south, which must always be maintained, in any event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to stress the importance I attach to moving from 10% to 20% in the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is, ‘how have you done it?’. Because this action is of interest to us in terms of future actions and requests by this Parliament. So where did you get that 10% from? Can the same be expected for other modes of transport?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the environmental impact. When you appeared before us in 1999, at your hearing as a candidate for Commissioner, you said that you would pay very close attention to the environmental impact. Do you intend to maintain this level of attention in relation to these projects and not be mechanically subject to the will of the States, which normally incorporate truly harmful environmental effects into some of these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have still not been able to digest the projects which you have just mentioned to us, but I would like to ask you a question with no ill intention, but simply so that we may know your initial opinion: do you think that your proposal tackles the problems of the peripheral regions and is therefore of a cohesive nature? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is going to be an enormous effort to integrate the Iberian Peninsula with the European rail network and this will bring about such interoperability, thereby making rail transport – for both people and goods – a genuine alternative to other types of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what I have just said will clearly serve to integrate the Iberian Peninsula more with the rest of the European Union, just as the Rhine-Rhone project or the Paris-Stuttgart-Linz-Vienna, and, later, Budapest, rail project will serve to integrate the East with the rest of the current European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of the link between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the European continent by means of the new alternative connection to the Oresund Bridge, to the Oresund connection, which is also approved in the new plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Izquierdo Collado, it does serve to integrate the peripheral areas with the centre and, in this respect, it is cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the aforementioned 10% and 20% thresholds, these are financing possibilities. It does not mean that 10% or 20% will be granted. There are times when 5% is granted and is the maximum limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Second issue. We will have to see whether the Council and Parliament support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Third issue. It works for all modes of transport, because these trans-European networks do not only include the elements I have indicated. Generically, there is the interconnection between ports and their adjacent land area, that is, rail interconnections, land interconnections, the intermodal interconnection not only of the sea ports but also of river ports, the modal interconnections between rail and airport, for interconnection with the air sector, and the interconnection between rail and road, essentially in the freight sector. In other words, there is another series of generic elements that I have not expanded upon, which are also included in these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we have to solve the problem of bottlenecks. In the case of bottlenecks, with much less action in terms of budget, we can achieve multiplier effects. Ten per cent of the road network and 20% of the rail network is affected by habitual bottlenecks. This does not mean that 20% of the rail network is a bottleneck. But there are problem points within this rail network that eventually effect 20% of the European rail network. Of course, we will try to ensure that funding is at the maximum level in these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to environmental impact, I maintain what has been said before. We have prepared all of this in common agreement with the department of Mrs Wallström and with the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment and we have agreed that we will continue to work jointly on its implementation and promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Langenhagen, we are going to hold a debate in relation to GALILEO. Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of my personal interest in this project, which I believe to be crucial in terms of European Union strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal opinion – although it is shared by the Services and by the Commission as a whole – what happened on 11 September gives us all the more reason to move ahead with this project. Clearly, not all of the applications that increasingly depend on the American global positioning system can rely on a single system. We need a second system that will complement and strengthen the current system, which is the American one. It is not a question of competing with the Americans. It is a question of participating, together with the Americans, in order to make the whole system more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, you know that Council will have to give its definitive opinion on these issues at its last meeting in December and I hope that on that occasion we will finally clear up any ambiguities and doubts once and for all and we will move ahead with a project which is essential to the future of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to mention one issue, and at the same time take the opportunity to say that I welcome the fact that it has been included, and that is the crossing of the Pyrenees. It is an issue that has received much less media attention than the Alps, but it is probably a more critical one. Even now, the number of heavyweight vehicles which cross the Pyrenees every day between the Iberian peninsula and France is greater than the number crossing the Alps. We shall therefore be faced with the development of a very critical situation, because infrastructures on the Atlantic side are lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the actual crossing, or central railway tunnel, I believe that this is a very good thing, but we must not forget that this tunnel will certainly not be constructed in the short term, since the Lyon-Turin tunnel and the Brenner tunnel have to be built first. I would like to make a personal plea – and I would like to hear your opinions on the subject – for emergency structures at either end of the Pyrenees, particular between the Basque Country and the Atlantic coast. It seems to me that it is there, first of all, because that is where the people and the activities are, that we shall free the bottleneck in the road and rail routes leading to the Iberian peninsula. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are talking about the Galician stretches of the high speed network, yes, they are included, as are the interconnections with Portugal, insofar as, I insist, it involves adapting and modifying these constructions in accordance with the European gauge, whether they be new lines or adaptations of existing lines, and I should like to make this clear. Furthermore, there is another series of projects which affect that part of Europe, such as issues relating to ports and other issues that I will not go into now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Savary, I fully share your concern about the Pyrenees. When, as the person responsible for transport in the European Union, I look at a map to see what is happening, I see a barrier, a wall, with a pass on the right of the map, on the far eastern side, and another on the left, in the west, and in between there is nothing. There is no railway. It now seems that there is going to be a pass at Canfranc but, for the moment, there are just those two passes. The Commission believes that, between now and 2010, we must provide a pass for a further 100 million tonnes between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now begin to discuss, prepare and work on a rail project that will create a great Pyrenean pass, not at the western or eastern extremes, but at the most central part; that will go further than the contribution of the possible creation of the Canfranc pass; that will create a truly significant rail route for goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about high figures. As you say, undoubtedly both the Spanish and the French governments will have to consider alternatives, because for that great central Pyrenean pass we are talking in terms of around 2015 to 2020, that is, in 15-20 years time, and this type of project has to be planned that far in advance and they have to be dealt with and initiated within that timescale.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, in any event, one of the Essen projects is still under way, which included the Basque ‘Y’, which also involves a European gauge link via that entrance to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Rübig that the Vienna-Bratislava motorway is included in the projects (I have not mentioned it because it is a lesser issue), which includes the stretch of that motorway within Austrian territory. A rail interconnection is not envisaged at the moment, but I would like to say that all of these aspects will clearly have to be looked at with care for the 2004 review, when enlargement has taken place, at least its first stage, if there are to be more stages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
