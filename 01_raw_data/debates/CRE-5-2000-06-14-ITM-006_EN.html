These amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible. I admit that our Rules of Procedure state that we must deliberate on the matter according to the conditions laid down by the Treaties, but I would remind you that, last April, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution, specifically bearing in mind the Intergovernmental Conference that was then taking place, which requested, with a very large majority, that the seat and working centres of the European Parliament should be decided on by Parliament itself. We could therefore quite easily have voted in favour of our amendments, waited for the results of the IGC and adapted the calendar accordingly. I dispute the statement that these amendments, supported by many of my fellow Members, are inadmissible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on. That is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable.

My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding, I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and, above all, for the work carried out by Mr Maaten, who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals, both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary, in an unbelievably short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time. There are so many proposals – 120 in all – that I fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other. We really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name. With the best will in the world and with the greatest respect for this issue, we must not forget that we really are not under any pressure and we should use the time available to us for careful reflection and review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action. I know that the tobacco industry lobby is most anxious to prevent this directive and I think that this request is yet another ploy to prevent a vote, which is clearly a matter of urgency, from taking place. I would remind you that the Council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard Parliament’s views. If we postpone our vote, the tobacco industry will gain even more time, since the Council will then not be able to state its position until the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think that Mr Maaten and the Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have produced a good piece of work. It is true that many amendments have been tabled and also that in future we will have to make efforts to improve our work so that fewer amendments are tabled in plenary. As it happens, however, I do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote. Everything is in place for a vote to be held.</p>

We are constantly wasting time in fruitless discussion and, in particular, with all these votes, resolutions, motions, urgent debates and so on and so forth which, when all is said and done, do not produce any tangible results and undermine the genuine legislative activity which should be the principle activity of a Parliament which is not an advisory body but an organ which adopts resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN),</span></span>   <span class="italic">in writing</span>.<span class="bold"> –</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> In the vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2001, most Members of the European Parliament believed that they had the right to remove Fridays from the monthly Strasbourg part-session. This is just another episode in the perpetual secret war waged by the anti-Strasbourg faction against the wording of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As far back as 1997, the anti-Strasbourg faction suffered a major defeat at the Court of Justice, having tried to completely remove one of the twelve ordinary monthly part-sessions. This time, they have tried to achieve their ends in a more subtle way, by cutting the duration of each ordinary part-session, without reducing their number. In fact, in its Judgement of 1 October 1997, the Court of Justice made it quite clear that the Edinburgh Council Decision of 12 December 1992, which was taken to enforce Article 216 of the Treaty, and was furthermore elevated to the rank of protocol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, was as valid as the Treaty and was therefore binding on the European Parliament. In the process, the European Parliament suffered the supreme humiliation of being reminded that it is not a sovereign Parliament, like a national Parliament, but merely an assembly established by treaty and subject to the conditions and limitations set by that treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Edinburgh decision, reiterated in the Amsterdam Protocol, states that “<span class="italic">The European Parliament shall have its seat in Strasbourg, where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions shall be held…”</span> In 1997, Mr Lenz, the Advocate-General, stressed the fact that if the text talks about “<span class="italic">where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions shall be held</span>” and not, for example, twelve plenary part-sessions are to be held at that location, this implies that the representatives of the Member State governments have submitted to a practice followed by the Parliament where its administration is concerned<span class="italic">.</span> This practice, inasmuch as it concerns us today, is that of the ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg, lasting a full week.</p>
<p class="contents">This practice, which serves as a basis for the terms of the Treaty, must be respected. If we allowed ordinary plenary part-sessions to be cut by one day, the rules could be stretched even further, with the result that Strasbourg would gradually no longer be the location for plenary part-session work. The wording of the Treaty would, as a result, be undermined by small, gradual steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to remind you that, as I understand it, setting additional part-sessions in Brussels a year in advance is not a practice that is in accordance with the treaty either. The 1997 judgement states that “additional plenary part-sessions can only be set for another working location if the Parliament holds the twelve ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg, which is the seat of the institution”. Quite logically, the Court therefore ruled that there can only be an “additional” part-session if the ordinary part-sessions have been held and if they have actually proven to be insufficient for the task of dealing with the cases under consideration. I conclude from this that the European Parliament does not have the right to set additional part-sessions more than a year in advance, as it currently does. Parliament would need to know if the ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg have been sufficient or insufficient to deal with matters pending. The fact is that it cannot know this so far in advance. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we might think that it is a contradiction to cut the week of the ordinary Strasbourg part-sessions, whilst maintaining the additional part-sessions in Brussels. If Parliament feels that we spend too long in sittings, it is the additional part-sessions in Brussels that should be removed first.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I greatly hope that the French Government will again refer the matter to the Court of Justice, as it did in 1995. I also hope that it will make a genuine effort make the journey to Strasbourg easier for our foreign colleagues. Why should we be surprised if those Members who have a 10 or 12-hour journey because of poor rail or air connections come to be exhausted and to take a dislike to Strasbourg? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Such a decision would not only threaten the institutional balance that has nonetheless been accepted by all Member States, but, even more seriously, it would threaten the ‘certain concept of Europe’ that Strasbourg symbolises: that of a political Europe that is reconciled and peaceful. For who can deny that the creation of a single capital for a federal Europe, which will have more than 500 million inhabitants in 10 years’ time, would be an aberration? This would be a disaster in terms of town planning, in terms of the environment and therefore in human terms! </p>
<p class="contents">Being modern in the 21st century means having a multipolar capital, at the heart of which Strasbourg will always have a special place.

<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we feel sure that Article 95 of the Treaty, covering the harmonisation of rules for the internal market, on which this draft is based, is an improper legal basis. The purpose of the provisions that have been proposed is actually to protect public health, not to remove obstacles to the movement of products. Article 152 of the Treaty, which refers to public health, authorises the Community to encourage cooperation between Member States, but under no circumstances to adopt binding harmonisation measures, as such, as these are expressly rules out by paragraph 3(c).</p>

<p class="contents">In such circumstances, we are well aware that the Commission, as is often the case, is currently using a praiseworthy cause – in this case, the anti-smoking campaign – in order to award itself new competencies, in spite of the wording of the Treaties and with no thought for subsidiarity. We have therefore voted in favour of the amendments to show that ultimately, we wanted to take a hard line, but at the same time, we urge the Council to turn the draft directive, pursuant to Article 152, into a recommendation that will encourage Member States to face up to their responsibilities. They are perfectly capable of doing so, and even if this national competence resulted in different consumer information rules in different countries, in line with their own culture, tobacco manufacturers would simply have to adapt to them.

<p class="contents">The measures that are adopted should furthermore impose the same restrictions, at least on European tobacco companies, when they manufacture their products under licence, or sell their poison, in the countries of Eastern Europe, in Africa or elsewhere. The behaviour of tobacco companies, which runs completely counter to the interests of society as a whole, mirrors the behaviour of all the large oil, asbestos, arms and agrifood companies, which are prepared to run the risk of harming the population or the environment in order to make a little more profit.</p>

On the other hand, we support the employees in this sector, as well as small tobacco producers, whose income, as well as conversion to useful production, should be financed by levies on the enormous profits of the tobacco companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the enthusiasm of youth, I hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Had I been listened to then, we would not now be crying over the billions spent on raw tobacco subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not trying here to come to terms with the past. Things are as they are and we shall have to live with them, because tobacco farmers cannot reasonably be expected to be left standing out in the rain after 30 years’ common organisation of the raw tobacco market. We have got them used to subsidies and that has, to all intents and purposes, destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco. Now the health missionaries in the House want to stamp out the cultivation of raw tobacco in the European Union altogether; this will naturally benefit imported tobacco – which they cannot and do not want to stop – without, of course, making chain smokers give up smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that a lot of people in the EU and everywhere else in the world die from lung cancer, which hits far more smokers than non-smokers. But the sort of bans imposing unreasonable demands on the European tobacco industry which the Committee on the Environment has cobbled together with no regard for job losses, especially for women, will not make the citizens of the European Union give up smoking, as the current drastic measures in relation to advertising and labelling have already proven. The suggestion that EU manufacturers should be required to comply with the same regulations as regards tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes intended for export to third countries is perverse in the extreme. Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant, but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU, then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses. Measures such as this would result in the relocation of 12% of cigarette production in the tiny principality of Luxembourg alone.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the European tobacco industry.</p>

One smoker in two will die, sooner or later, from a smoking-related disease. These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying. </p>
<p class="contents">Surely we need no further reason to support the proposed directive in its current form, quite rightly amended by our rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whom I must congratulate on his remarkable work, the broad outlines of which I have supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Tobacco is not just like any other product. It requires specific regulation and it is most apt, in light of recent studies, that the Commission has proposed a revision of the legislative texts in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it may seem naïve to try to eradicate smoking, I think that we can certainly reduce it considerably by providing the consumer with better information. We have just declared ourselves in favour, much to my satisfaction, of warnings that will cover 35% of the front and 45% of the back of the cigarette packet. Personally, I am sorry that most of my colleagues could not be convinced of the impact that photographs on these surfaces would have had.</p>
<p class="contents">I supported Amendment No 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16. To the anti-prohibitionists, who feel that this ban would, on the contrary, make cigarettes more attractive to young people, I would answer with an ethical argument. Our society has the duty, in certain areas, to set strict moral limits. It is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here. This also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular. Such education must be started at the earliest possible age, and I think that adolescence is an appropriate stage to instil in young people the limits that they must not transgress.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of ethical considerations, too, I feel it is reasonable to ban exports of products that we consider to be harmful to our own citizens to countries outside the Union. I voted in the strongest possible terms against Amendment No 54. Europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets.</p>
<p class="contents">During yesterday’s debate, some Members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis, Aids or other infectious diseases. This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands. Mr Maaten’s report is a step in the right direction, but is only one step, because the fight for life, for health, is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nobody questions the validity of its aims: smoking kills 500 000 people per year in the European Union alone. We must therefore fight vigorously against smoking, just as we must fight unremittingly against drug addiction, alcoholism and all dangerous addictions, whether they are of natural or chemical origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we can only share this report’s proposals, which seek more effectively to warn, make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption. Let us even go beyond labelling or limiting toxic substances by making better use than we currently do of the special fund established under the common organisation of the market for tobacco and to which producers pay contributions in order to fund the research and development of less harmful varieties. On the other hand, however, let us be careful not to destabilise too suddenly, without allowing time to convert, a farming sector that involves 135 000 producers and employs 400 000 seasonal workers, in often very vulnerable agricultural regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, there are a few basic principles which I feel must guide our action: we must act fairly against all factors likely to cause addiction, such as advertising and excessive consumption of dangerous pharmacological substances – funded, moreover, from the social security system –and we must ensure that restrictions on tobacco production within the Union are accompanied by the monitoring and restriction of imports so that their effects on consumption are not cancelled out. We must give tobacco growers an adequate timescale in which to adapt their production to the new standards for tar content and we must reject any restriction on subsidies for tobacco production unless we replace them with aid as an incentive for conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we must ensure that it is not only European Union producers – who supply only 25% of the raw tobacco consumed in Europe – who, without compensation or an adequate timescale, bear the costs of a regulation which is undeniably praiseworthy, but which is too sketchy in the form that has been proposed to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs, with warnings 40% of the packet size on the front and 50% on the back.</p>
<p class="contents">Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that. Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these, half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life. As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada. If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking, go ahead and print them on packs. I am disappointed it was not accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation. I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals. They have misled people for far too long. At present, warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging. Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as ‘ultra light’ and ‘low tar’. People have been hooked on the idea that ‘mild’ and ‘low tar’ cigarettes are healthier. This is simply not true. Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes.

<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar, 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries. This would result in a massive erosion of EU cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs.</p>

The EU is acting inconsistently, given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of EUR 1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world. That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries.

<p class="contents">This issue shows that, in the case of Finland, the Commission realises that private individuals’ being more or less free to import alcohol across national borders is not only a trade and tax issue. More to the point, it has to do with public health and with a social policy on alcohol aimed at combating the horrors of abuse. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the Swedish derogations from 1994 concerning private imports of alcohol into Sweden. While Finland is obtaining a new derogation, the Swedish one is being removed. In this way, the Commission, together with the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bolkestein, are drastically undermining the tools of alcohol policy, democratically decided by the Swedish parliament and government and consisting of high taxes and a restriction on imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember how, when I was a child, one of the books which I found most interesting and which I will never forget bore the title: ‘My friend the atom’ by Walt Disney. This book explained clearly how our future would be improved by the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, today, we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about. And who was that? We should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible, although I still do not know who that is. Maybe you can enlighten me, Mr President.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not have any major disagreement with the basic proposal, but I do have questions about this programme’s budget, and the rapporteur has not provided us with any practical proposals on this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that he rejected the proposal by the European Commission. Let us remember that the Commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using, at the end of each year, unspent appropriations from heading 3. To this end, it would use a ‘reception’ line under the current sub-section B4, which covers energy, the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research, a point stressed by the European Parliament, but it nevertheless falls short of what is required. We cannot accept the long-term financing of the dismantling of nuclear activities through a ‘miscellaneous’ line, of an order which is left to chance. I must take this opportunity to say that I do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line!</p>
<p class="contents">I imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to “take note” of the Commission’s proposal, without actually putting it into practice. The report proposes that we establish a trialogue between the institutions in order to reach a solution but says nothing about the alternative means for financing that have been suggested. The most mistaken course of action would therefore be to have the dismantling of these nuclear activities financed by Member States, by methods that still remain to be found. That would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a self-contained budget line. I am quite aware that it is not the easiest solution, because it involves voting for additional appropriations in the review of the Financial Perspectives. Nevertheless, we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions, particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, then, we will have to put pressure on the Council to accept the creation of this self-contained budget line. In the shorter term, for pragmatic reasons, we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme. I therefore support the following compromise: in the very short term we set up the ‘picking up the pieces’ line proposed by the Commission, and initiate the trialogue promptly in order, in the medium term, to achieve a vote for an self-contained budget line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
