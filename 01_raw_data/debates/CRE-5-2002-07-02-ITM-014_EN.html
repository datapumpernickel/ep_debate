<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I start this debate, I should like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of my fellow Members of this House who have tried to reach the widest possible agreement on this topic in a constructive manner. I am aware that, for some of them, this is a sensitive issue, and I appreciate their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use my speaking time to do away with two misconceptions that are nourished by an aggressive mail campaign to which we have all been subjected over the past few days.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this report does not call for harmonisation of legislation at European level. It does not impose anything on the Member States or the candidate countries. We remain convinced that legislation and measures must remain within the remit of Member States, and the report therefore takes full account of subsidiarity. What the report does do is to launch an appeal, at European level, to bring into motion a learning process, to collect information about the situation in the Member States, to examine the constituent parts of policy in the Member States concerning sexual and reproductive health and rights and the measures that yield positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have very good reasons for giving this speech. First of all, there are a whole number of areas in which the European Union has set up a comparable system of best practice, of mutual learning and of exchange of information. Less than an hour ago, we discussed in this House the Trakatellis report on a European health strategy in which such an approach is justified and encouraged within the framework of an action programme. Sexual and reproductive health needs to form part of a health promotion campaign, and I therefore fail to recognise why this would not be fitting here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we talk about development and cooperation policy, this Parliament, along with the entire EU, rightly argues that sexual and reproductive rights must form part of such development and cooperation policy. It would be rather bizarre if we argued this on behalf of the developing countries, with European voices falling silent the moment we talked about our own policy. Moreover, there is reason for concern. There are huge differences in the situation in the Member States in terms of sexual and reproductive health. </p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that in some candidate countries, the number of abortions is up to ten times higher than in the Member States that obtain the best score in this area? It is understandable, because the price of contraception in some candidate countries amounts to one third of the wage of women, while abortions are free. </p>
<p class="contents">Surely this is not the kind of policy we wish to promote. I will give you another example. Why is it that a number of countries are experiencing an incredible rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies while other countries manage to handle this situation? Should we ask ourselves whether teenagers are so different, or whether policy is so different? I therefore urge you to learn from each other without the need to harmonise.</p>
<p class="contents">The second prejudice concerns the fact that this is not an abortion report. Quite the reverse, in fact. The report is looking for ways to enable women to choose whether they want children, when they want them and how many they want, and to experience their sexuality in a healthy way. This means that the report aims to prevent unwanted pregnancies and therefore also abortions. Paragraph 8 states quite clearly that abortion should not be encouraged as a method of family planning. However, we must develop a 3-track policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first track is open sexual education and information. Far too many young people still believe that it is impossible to conceive the first time they have intercourse, or they receive their sexual education through pornographic films. This information should be about forming relationships and about how to relate to each other in a responsible manner. If sexual education is reduced to biology, things are bound to go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The second track is that every woman must be able to make a free choice with regard to her sexual and reproductive health. This means that she must have access to a wide range of contraception and effective services, and must be informed about the pros and cons. This choice is not there if women have to pay up to a third of their wage. It also means that we need to make an extra effort for those groups that are currently not being reached. All campaigns that claim that this is to talk in terms of eugenics are acting in a very deceitful manner. I am convinced that emergency contraception, specifically the morning-after pill, should also form part of this draft. I hope that the PPE-DE Group will continue to support the amendments tabled by both groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The third track is the most controversial of the three. I also believe that abortion should be the last resort of a policy on sexual and reproductive rights for women who have been let down by contraception. In fact, abortion has been legalised in most countries. I urge you not to turn a blind eye to abortion tourism, the journeys which some women are compelled to undertake because contraception has indeed failed them. This entails a serious social injustice because only those who are sufficiently well off can afford these journeys. In fact, the report urges the Member States not to prosecute those women who have had an illegal abortion nevertheless. By saying this, we are only regurgitating what has been said at the Peking plus 5 platform.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a huge number of discussions have preceded this debate. Even just before this meeting, attempts were made to reach the greatest consensus possible. I hope that these attempts will be rewarded tomorrow and that the Commission will lend its support in order to launch an initiative.</p>

We have to take account of the diverse cultures, religions and traditions united within the European Union and give priority to ethical considerations. The European Union does not in fact have any competence when it comes to legislating on abortion or health systems. That is the job of the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity must be brought to bear to its full extent in this sensitive area and must not be ignored. Reproductive health is also a matter for the Member States. The EU's job here is to draw up carefully thought-out guidelines and foster collaboration between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This report confines itself to other matters not mentioned in the title. Thus, to talk of emergency contraception is completely misleading. What this refers to is the morning-after pill and that is clearly not a form of prevention; it is quite simply an early abortion. Encouraging the demand for abortion and the morning-after pill as standard practice in the European Union and the accession countries without any formalities is unacceptable. The PPE-DE is also firmly against legalising abortion. Numerous European countries have already enshrined the unborn child's right to protection from the state in their constitutions. No one has the right of life or death over another person and any demands to the contrary run counter to the spirit of our humanistic culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The report takes no account of what needs to be done in order to guarantee effective prevention. There is no mention whatsoever of mutual responsibility in a relationship or of the indispensable role of parents and family in sex education, two decisive factors in preventing unwanted pregnancies. This report sends out a misleading message, not just to the Member States of the EU, especially Ireland, but also to the accession countries. Like all of you, I have received numerous letters and telephone calls from worried organisations and individuals in candidate countries. People there suffered for a very long time under undemocratic regimes which arbitrarily controlled all areas of their life, even the most intimate. This is one reason this report not only worries, but incites anxiety and mistrust of the European Union in the central and eastern European countries. It makes fundamental demands on the governments of the accession countries, which are completely excluded from the decision-making process. That contradicts our understanding of the word democracy. The Charter of Fundamental Rights requires us to uphold human dignity and protect life. The principles of the European Union include subsidiarity and maintaining cultural diversity. And we should not forget that when we vote on this report tomorrow.</p>

As previous speakers have said, this is a very delicate subject which touches on the most intimate area of our citizens' lives. So exactly what is this report about? It is about the right that, at the end of the day, no one here in this House would wish to be deprived of. It is about the right of control over ones own body. Women cannot be denied this right, the less privileged in the European Union cannot be denied this right, the citizens who are to join the European Union cannot be denied this right. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has, without any shadow of a doubt, recognised the primary competence of the Member States in safeguarding sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">But Europe also has a huge responsibility as pioneers in the world, as we conveyed at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, when we defended the concept of the need to safeguard sexual health and reproductive rights. Mrs van Lancker has abided very closely by these specifications and has presented a whole host of best practices in her report, the most important being proper education on responsible sexual conduct, on which we need careful guidance by experts, with the Member States providing full coverage by professional advice centres. A gender-specific approach aimed at young people is needed and mutual respect and responsibility must be shown on sexual matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must ensure that girls who become pregnant are not excluded from education which, unfortunately, is what usually happens. There are pointers on this in the White Paper on Youth. We must offer a networked policy here, which is why the European Parliament and the Commission also have work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take a closer look at the situation in the candidate countries, where little contraception is available at affordable prices and abortion is often used as a method of family planning. As the van Lancker report clearly states, we must prevent this. Abortion can never be the solution; we must prevent unwanted pregnancies per se. The sub-text is probably that it stops women from becoming independent and I am quite appalled at this campaign, which was attacked once again here in Parliament: with half truths, by questionable means, millions of women are being disconcerted by the assertion that terminating a pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer. Half truths are being used to make millions of women insecure and deprive them of their rights. We will not stand for this any longer, which is why I hope that there will be a large majority in favour of Mrs Van Lancker's report tomorrow.</p>

However, once the decision was made to draft a report, we simply decided to cooperate in a constructive manner with a view to achieving a good content. We would congratulate Mrs Van Lancker who did a sterling job in this respect. She is right to call for effective measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of sexual information is essential to avoid unwanted pregnancies and diseases. Statistics clearly bear this out. In addition, as Mrs Gröner pointed out a moment ago, owning your own body and your sexuality is a right. It is, in my view, a fundamental right that should not only be guaranteed in Europe and the candidate countries, but throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Most EU countries apply sound legal provisions where birth control and abortion are concerned. In those countries, health risks have fallen. It would therefore be completely implausible if we were to adopt amendments in this Parliament tomorrow which would force the Van Lancker report to make a step backwards in relation to the effective provisions in the Member States. The ELDR Group is therefore opposed to the overwhelming majority of the tabled amendments, because these threaten to undermine the very balanced text. We support the current text, certainly with regard to the two most sensitive issues: the morning-after pill must be cheap and available over the counter, and abortion must be safe and legal. Those who do not support this create the possibility of very vulnerable women and girls once again ending up in little backrooms with knitting needles in the foreseeable future. If that is the message that this Parliament sends out tomorrow, our group will refuse to have any part in this.</p>

<p class="contents">We sit in a parliament and we live in democracies. We have experienced two UN conferences, a conference on population in Cairo in 1994, and a conference on women in Peking in 1995. What did those two conferences say? On the one hand, that the question of controlling fertility and reproduction was a human right, and on the other, in 1995 in Peking, that it was a woman’s right. Human rights or women’s rights – they are still rights. We are therefore stating people’s rights, not controlling populations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the <span class="italic">e</span>-mails and in the scores of letters that I receive, I discover that the only things being discussed are population control, women’s fertility, retirement for all, falling birth rates in our countries – we could also talk about birth rates, why not – and that is what I would call population control. That has nothing to do with rights. I believe, therefore, that the proposed amendment is quite representative of the conflict that we have here. If we accept that we are in a country as of right, we can go so far as to say what I myself say, namely that the right to contraception, to fertility control, is the <span class="italic">habeas corpus </span>of women. We said thirty years ago that our bodies belong to us. This is what is known as <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span>, the exact translation of the English expression, ‘our bodies our selves’. That is called <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we look at matters from that viewpoint, we shall not fantasise about the subsidiarity reaffirmed in Article 1. We shall not fantasise about abortion, which would become the way to obtain contraception. No one wants an abortion. No one would wish an abortion on anyone. It has nothing to do with contraception. Therefore, if we look at things from that angle, we are looking at them from the angle of women’s rights, which are the equivalent of human rights, and I believe that with this in mind, unless we want to contradict ourselves, we must vote in favour of Mrs Van Lancker’s report.</p>

Mrs Van Lancker has taken ample account not only of all the groups, but also of the different sensitivities within the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The sensitivity of the report is evident for everyone to see. It concerns an issue which urgently requires clear policy. After all, there is today a huge discrepancy between the different Member States in terms of the rights of women in the area of sexual and reproductive health. This means that the right to decide what happens to your own body is also different in the Member States. All Member States must shoulder their individual responsibility in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In some countries, it is still completely impossible these days to terminate a pregnancy in a legal and safe manner. As a consequence, ‘abortion shopping’ is on the increase. Mrs Van Lancker mentioned this a moment ago. However, women will go where they can. For example, last year, no fewer than 6 000 women travelled from Ireland to Great Britain for an abortion. The numbers increase every year. My fellow MEP here only knows this too well, as she is from Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Such statistics illustrate that this is a fact that will affect virtually every family sooner or later, particularly in those countries where sexual education and access to contraception remain sub-standard. I can identify with people who are against legalising abortion, but I do ask myself whether our policy-makers have the right to deny women an abortion? Every policy-maker must be acutely aware of their educational role and it is exactly for that reason that we must also prevent pregnancy from in future becoming something one either does or does not have insurance for. Under no circumstances whatsoever should it be possible to proceed with a termination, whatever the pressures to do so, without the consent of the woman.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what really matters therefore is to protect pregnant women, on the one hand, and accept that it is always the woman herself who has to decide what happens to her body, on the other. Consequently, Member States therefore have an enormous task of preventing abortions that are not carried out for specifically woman-related reasons, such as poverty, career or stigmatisation. We will be voting in favour of the proposal tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot even endorse the language used, which I consider to be far removed from my own view of the matter and that of many European Catholic women and non-religious women too, who believe deeply in the values of life, the family and motherhood. Just by way of example, there are repeated references throughout the text to reproductive rights and fertility awareness: terms which, quite frankly, I feel would be more suited to cattle than women, who are human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be more respectful to talk about the right to maternity, to informed maternity, about emotional education, but, above all, apart from a number of general and therefore largely acceptable statements, I feel that the entire report is based on the imperative of upholding the right to contraception, particularly emergency contraception – the morning-after pill – and to abortion, for both the Member States and the candidate countries. All that is unacceptable in that it rides roughshod over the principle of subsidiarity and therefore the right of each Member State to decide on its own health policy, and especially because it trivialises recourse to abortion and shows no genuine respect for life and the rights of the unborn child.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this is a proposal which does very little of substance to develop a responsible policy promoting solidarity and the family, adoption and the protection of child mothers, which totally disregards all the legislative measures and good practices which exist to help pregnant women and mothers, offering practical help for women expecting a child, dissuading them from resorting to abortion by providing a programme of economic aid and proper social and psychological help. Therefore, Mr President, my group will vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress in this area might have been expected since 1994, but the opposite has unfortunately been the case: the Arabic countries have entered into an unholy alliance with President Bush to obstruct the UN’s work on achieving the ICPD objectives. I was just recently at the American Congress in Washington in connection with a hearing concerning Mr Bush’s Mexico City Policy. I was together with a member of the Russian Duma who was able to state that, after the IPPF had made provision for reproductive health facilities in Russia, the number of abortions had fallen by as much as 25%. Why? The answer is quite logical. Any woman who has unintentionally become pregnant and refers herself to a clinic for an abortion instead of carrying out the abortion herself is always made aware of options other than abortion, informed about how she might avoid an unwanted pregnancy in the future and alerted to the possibility of HIV infection. The policies which this report proposes that Member States introduce will therefore lead to fewer, not more, abortions. The campaign conducted by opponents of abortion against the report is therefore absurd and, in certain cases, downright unsavoury. I am thinking of the e-mail sent by The Truth of God, maintaining that the real intention is to introduce eugenics in order to get rid of the poor and that the IPPF was founded by the British Eugenics Society. Statements such as these are an insult to our intelligence, but should also be followed up by libel proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">A vote in favour of this report is a vote in favour of ensuring everyone’s basic right to take free and informed decisions concerning their emotional, sexual and reproductive lives and of ensuring that everyone has the same opportunities to increase and protect their sexual and reproductive rights and, especially, to be protected against HIV infection. A desire to safeguard basic rights should be reason enough for voting in favour of the report. In order to reduce the risk of the spread of HIV, it is essential to vote in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that, since 1995, all the States – and I would stress, all of them – have willingly been signatories to the UN Declaration on reproductive rights. Whether we like the term or not, the fact remains that all the Member States signed this declaration independently: therefore, Europe is not imposing anything on anybody, especially since the report itself confirms that the matter falls within the competence of the Member States, and the Member States, I reiterate, have already independently and freely subscribed to all these provisions since 1995. Quite the opposite, if there is any criticism we might make of the report amongst ourselves, it is that it does not go far enough as regards the freedom of women to choose to have children. In other words it does not say anything about assisted fertilisation, an issue which is currently the subject of much debate in my country, for example, and, if anything, that it is not ambitious enough in that it does not mention options such as RU-486. There you are, if anything, these are the points on which the report is too cautious, but I will vote for it in any case. I would, however, stress that the report seems to be a repeat of documents which have already been adopted by the Member States and that, in my opinion, it does not represent much progress. In view of the political dispute, I will, as I said before, vote for the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that we could have been a little more ambitious, for example as regards the new techniques that science has placed at the disposal of women’s health and reproductive rights. The fact that this is still a women’s issue is, I am sad to say, borne out by this House today. Although children and the family life of couples must, or should clearly be, matters addressed by both partners together, the very composition of this House today is a clear indication – and maybe that is genuinely the ways things are – that, ultimately, this is still an issue which can only be addressed by ensuring that women have the freedom to choose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has given us an opportunity to make two findings. First, there is an information vacuum in modern society on sexual and reproductive health issues, such as transmittable diseases and how to combat them, and contraceptive methods and their advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, there are differences between, and even, in certain countries, a lack of policies on, family planning, sex education and sexual and reproductive health services, and we have agreed to exchange best practices on promoting modern policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We engaged in an up-to-the-minute dialogue between the political groups in committee and representatives of European society and we agreed that these issues are vital to today's European citizens, especially women. However, we also made another finding or, to put it another way, we were the butt of particularly vehement reaction on the part of governments, political parties and representatives of women's agencies, because we are giving out advice and guidelines – not to mention taking decisions – on issues on which Europe has no authority. These concerns were taken as a very important political message by my group, especially now that we are trying to define our authority at European and national level and persuade the people of the European Union and the candidate countries that we respect democracy, subsidiarity and cultural differences, and we took on board the message that asking the Member States to legalise abortion or not to prosecute women who illegally terminate their pregnancy or to hand out the morning-after pill without a doctor's prescription does absolutely nothing for our credentials. It just creates confusion and distrust among our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When I and my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights visited Poland, we all stressed how important it is to engage in dialogue on women's rights at all levels and in all spheres of life and for policies to develop and adapt to new social and historic circumstances and Europe is not going to come along and reduce national ideologies, customs and conscience or cultural differences to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge the rapporteur's well-intentioned efforts to get us to agree on a text and I personally hoped that we might achieve a text which was acceptable both to us and to the people of the European Union. Unfortunately, the message to come out of the report is not the message which the Europe People's Party thinks the European Parliament should send out, which is why we shall not be voting in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, which I think is outstanding, has nevertheless given rise to major discussions and extreme positions. Its most controversial point has undoubtedly been abortion, although the report deliberately starts by stating that abortion must not be encouraged as a method of family planning. Abortion must be seen as the solution of last resort and the report suggests various ways of achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">Abortion is, however, a very real social tragedy. The blame, the pain, the physical and mental violence that abortion entails are borne predominantly by women. Consequently, in all Member States of the European Union with the exception of Ireland and Portugal, legal solutions have already been found for society to recognise every woman’s right to be attended by medical specialists in the abortion procedure. The tragedy of undergoing an abortion is enough in itself. It is time for this procedure no longer to be considered a crime and for the public persecution in the courts and in the media to stop! I feel that this report is an act of hope for the women of my country, showing them that we in Europe are fighting for everyone to enjoy equal rights, for there to be tolerance and solidarity, for the hypocrisy to end and for the health and dignity of all women to be protected. Calls for tolerance, respect and solidarity are sometimes met with obscurantism and boundless narrow-mindedness. In Portugal, a referendum on decriminalising abortion, which was not binding because less than one-third of the population voted, was won by the ‘no’ campaign. The situation has gone from bad to worse in the meantime and the proof is that numerous women have already been taken to court, I myself have been bombarded with messages from activists from the ‘no’ campaign to vote against this report, and, to top it all, the so-called ‘pro-life’ association has just instigated legal proceedings against Mrs Van Lancker in Portugal. If this were three hundred years ago, she would have been handed over to the Inquisition! It is sad, but this is still the situation in Portugal, and this is why it so important for us Portuguese to see this report approved and to feel the solidarity of Europe on such a sensitive issue.</p>

It is an excellent piece of work, which is very much in line with the final statements of the Cairo and Beijing United Nations conferences and is intended to ensure the exchange of best practices in the field of reproductive health and in the defence of women’s rights and dignity. As recently became clear in Portugal when 17 women were subjected to the shame of court proceedings, with the investigation of their private lives and with the accusation of having had an illegal abortion – which was not proved, except in one case – in which the young woman was unacceptably convicted, this is not the way to combat illegal abortion. Another reason is that those who have the financial means can always go to a country where the procedure is practised legally. Portuguese women, for example, go to neighbouring Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is true that abortion, as the report states, must not be encouraged as a method of family planning, it is crucial that a health and social policy be put in place that enables women to resort less to abortion, specifically through the promotion of sexual education and of family planning properly targeting young people, so as to prevent unwanted pregnancies, specifically amongst adolescents. It is equally crucial, however, that the voluntary termination of pregnancy is legal, safe and universally accessible in order to safeguard reproductive health and women’s rights, as the report states, and that all women have access to this procedure, regardless of their economic and financial situation, and not only those who can afford to have it done in a good clinic in a neighbouring country. This is hypocrisy and must end as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not, therefore, even be discussing it or voting on it tomorrow. This abusive external interference in self-determination and in the free will of the citizens reaches the height of absurdity in paragraph 28, by proposing to force our taxpayers to finance actions in third countries in the service of a militant agenda to promote abortion. This, as a matter of fact, is the report’s greatest weakness: an apparent lack of focus and considerable confusion. It takes issues which, when taken individually, are positive, such as the rejection of abortion as a method of family planning, the need to reduce the recourse to abortion and the viewing of sex education in a global and positive way, based on mutual respect and on responsibility. The report, however, confuses these issues with others that either correspond exactly to the opposite doctrine or which lead, as has been proved, to the opposite result. Consequently, the overall implementation of this set of guidelines that has prevailed in many countries, as formulated in the report, can only lead to disastrous results, some of them recognised, as a matter of fact, in the report both in the number of teenage pregnancies and in the alarming spread of sexually transmitted diseases despite all the information that is so widely distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the media, my country would be one of the direct targets of this report. Portugal held a referendum four years ago on liberalising abortion and won ‘the right to life’. I am, therefore, sorry to see some federalists here choosing to see the Community as an appeals court and supporting the scam of putting pressure on the free expression of the citizens’ will, whilst the debate is obviously still ongoing. This debate, however, which is a serious one, is not on women’s rights, but on the rights of the child, of the child that has been created and is about to be born. This is what divides us, not the body of the person who chooses but the life of those who have no choice. The report takes the side of the stronger against the weaker. The weaker person is also often the woman who has been abandoned by her husband or partner, or pressured by her social set to have an abortion that, deep down, she does not want. And the weakest is always and in every case the child, who is at a vulnerable and helpless stage of development. It is the weakest that need the protection of society and of the law and who look to us to provide this. In my country we choose to act in this way; we take the side of the weakest. And it is our right to do so, provided that this is allowed by law and that this is what our citizens want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the opposite is the case. It is true that they are the reason why this report on sexual and reproductive health and rights was originally written, but in an unpleasant way. Parliament is imposing on the candidate countries its own time-limited standards regarding abortion, contraception and sexual education concerning free sex.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, after all, what is behind the fine rhetoric. An outlook on life in which individual sexual and reproductive self-determination are praised as the ideal, while nothing is being said about the downsides. Rightless, unborn children, damaged lives of women as well as men and distorted views of love and sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Century-old values of fidelity and love within a marriage bond as it is mentioned in the Bible remain the best guarantees for human well-being. However, in this report, we look in vain for essential information which promotes both physical and mental health.</p>
<p class="contents">What is left is a report on an area of policy which does not concern the EU, but which nevertheless wants to impose on the candidate countries, without any respect for their own independence, the godless morals that are currently prevalent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it shows contempt for the principle of subsidiarity, because it means that the European Union is interfering not only in the Member States but also in the applicant countries, by trying to compel them to integrate into their legislation provisions which are contrary to their ethics, as a condition for their accession to the Union. Then there is the fact that sexual and reproductive rights are not mentioned in any treaty, in any European convention, or in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Also curious is the fact that the reproductive rights in question consist of a whole list of processes which actually prevent reproduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is irresponsible to teach very young children a policy of sex without discernment. The educational choices which have to be made on this subject are the responsibility of parents and the family. Moreover, one cannot reduce sex education to mere contraception, nor regard abortion as a method of family planning. Is abortion the only solution to the distress of a pregnant woman? On the contrary, sex education is an apprenticeship preparing children for freedom, for responsibility and for respect for their own bodies and those of other people. Respect for human dignity and consideration for women in difficulties should have led us to propose measures that were more responsible and showed more respect for life. Unfortunately that has not happened, and that is why I shall be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area. While it can be useful to discuss these matters and to tease them out, the particular timing of this report, which I accept was a long time in the pipeline, is causing an awful lot of collateral damage, which perhaps it was not intended to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I state categorically that even today the topic of this report is on websites in Ireland and is being used by the "no to Nice" campaign to beat around the ears those like myself who would be part of the "yes" campaign in relation to the Nice Treaty. It is already being used on websites, including the website of a Member of this Parliament to say 'this is what Europe is about; look what they will do given half a chance. They will dictate to us on ethical issues'. I plead with colleagues, whatever your views are on the important topics in that report, do not let what we do in this Parliament be misused and abused by those people.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly sensitive to the issue in Ireland at this point in time. It is not only in our interest in Ireland that we ratify the Nice Treaty, it is in the interests of all the accession states who want to rejoin the European family. Those accession states themselves have contacted many of us and the leaders of many groups about the added difficulties this report is causing.</p>
<p class="contents">I know personally that three accession countries are having serious problems. They have a battle to win the hearts and minds of their people in relation to joining Europe, just as we have in Ireland at this particular time in relation to the ratification of the Nice Treaty. I do not mind what your views are on this issue. They are secondary at this point in time to the collateral damage this report is doing in accession states and in Ireland. That concerns me greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite a lot of other matters have been raised. Personally I do not have any difficulties with the morning-after pill. I do not consider it an abortifacient. Some of my colleagues, who like me will be voting against this report, might disagree with me on that. But we might as well get the biological facts right. It is emergency contraception. It is not an abortifacient because you do not have implantation of the fertilised egg until up to 72 hours after fertilisation. It cannot be an abortion if you are not pregnant. Let us stick to the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the report, I feel, is very badly drafted and very repetitive. But the important point is that this is a subsidiarity issue and we must give no indication that it is otherwise. We have no competence in this Parliament. The collateral damage at this point in time is huge. I regret that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of them concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution breaches this principle, which forces us not only to respect Members States’ exercising their autonomy in matters that fall within their competence but also to encourage them to do so and to exclude illegitimate interference in the internal jurisdiction of each State. The European Union must abstain from intervening in a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States. It is widely known and quite clear that this report addresses issues that do not fall within the scope of the European Union’s competences, and interferes particularly in policies of health and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of the cardinal sins concerns the serious fact that this proposal deliberately and flagrantly disregards the will of the citizens, expressed freely and democratically in the referenda on the decriminalisation of abortion held in some Members States, such as Portugal, for example. The aim of approving this proposal is to create a means of pressure once again to place the discussion on the voluntary termination of a pregnancy on the political agenda of some Members States. This will furthermore have the perverse consequence of creating suspicion amongst the citizens of Members States and also of the candidate countries, and this report is thereby doing a disservice to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is an original political model founded on cultural diversity and on respect for the historical and ethical heritage of each of the nations that it comprises. European integration must give priority to these values. Deepening the European spirit must involve respect for differences and for strengthening the principle that decisions must be taken at the closest possible level to the citizens of the Union. These two requirements are missing from the report that we are today debating.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, for these reasons, we do not accept this proposal and have no alternative but to vote against it. I wish lastly to pay tribute to the commitment of Emilia Müller, the shadow rapporteur for this controversial report, who spared no effort to try to improve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite improvements over recent years in the sexual and reproductive health of women, the indicators still show high abortion rates, especially among teenagers, low rates of contraceptive use and an increase in sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">However, worst of all is the return in certain areas of the Union to anachronistic and obscurantist perceptions of sexual rights, contraception, equality of the sexes and women's right to self-determination. The fact that conservative and religious circles have taken action and flooded us with papers over recent days in a bid to overturn the vote in favour of this report makes that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">On the pretext of protecting life, they basically propose criminalising abortion and incriminating women and even prosecuting them under Portuguese standards. They are our familiar adversaries in the battle for equality of the sexes and women's rights and we know that when they talk about morals they usually display the double moral standard of one sauce for the goose and one for the gander.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously absolutely no one advocates abortion as a contraceptive method; however, it is often a necessity and is generally carried out under the pressure of adverse social, economic, psychological or cultural conditions. Does anyone dispute the fact that many pregnancies are the result of some sort of violence against women? But apart from women's health and rights, should we not be ensuring that children are born into an environment in which they are welcome, so as to safeguard their proper mental, physical and spiritual development? It is worth pointing out that statistics show that the number of abortions is very low wherever there is a high level of free reproductive health and contraception services, in countries in which pregnant women facing difficulties, such as unmarried mothers, are given material support and where liberal legislation on the termination of pregnancy is combined with serious and effective sex education and information, especially for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that the European Union and the Council, and the candidate countries, should step up their efforts and should give priority to and formulate an integrated European policy on reproductive health, with the emphasis on prevention, contraception and sex education and information for young people. The principle of subsidiarity must not under any circumstances be used as an excuse to prevent the European Parliament from taking a stance on such an important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I condemn the fact that the report merely recommends or urges governments, instead of forcing them to include, in their legislation, laws along these lines. Like other women, I do not regard abortion as a normal method of contraception. However, a woman’s right to have control over her own body ought to be an inalienable right. It is revolting that in certain countries of the European Union that right is denied in law, while in other countries it is denied in practice. I also find it extremely shocking that even here, in the European Parliament, speakers dare to oppose the few improvements that this report proposes by propounding ideas which are as barbarous as they are reactionary and by voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lateness of the hour and the limited speaking time oblige me to confine myself to one single reason from a nonetheless long list of reasons for rejecting this report, and for the sake of convenience, I will therefore pass over the fact that Parliament has no authority whatsoever in the fundamental matters underlying this report, and what is before us should really be considered as a kind of ideological occupational therapy, as the umpteenth violation of the subsidiarity principle and as an attempt to force the practice of abortion on the candidate countries as some kind of <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, which is wholly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you a fundamental reason. It really is beyond me how the termination of life by abortion can be considered as a kind of victory in terms of human rights in such a nonchalant manner. I am quite happy to enter into a debate with people who ask for sympathy for emergency cases, but this report’s abortion propaganda, which is hardly discreet, goes against the grain with me. In fact, I think that taking life is the opposite of reproductive health. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, moreover, that very many abortions, the majority of them, in fact, are the result of parents lacking the material resources to accommodate children, for example, because marriage is still being penalised fiscally, because child benefit is too low or because our society does not value the family. Despite this, there is in Europe an enormous demographic problem, one that can obviously not be solved by abortion, but by sound, positive family policy and sound, child-friendly policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is subject to subsidiarity and, as an amendment by my Group recognises, its aim is for all the Member States of the Union to have the same policy, in other words for all the States to have the same law on a matter that is subject to subsidiarity but which, above all, depends upon the beliefs, traditions and patrimony of each State.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains a number of positive elements, in particular with regard to information and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, better education in schools and improved access to family planning centres and clinics, in particular for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there has been an increase in unwanted pregnancies among young women, and even young girls, but we cannot allow unrestricted abortion to be put forward as a solution to this problem, because the fact is that the ultimate objective of this own-initiative report is to introduce unrestricted abortion and the morning-after pill into the legislation of the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries as an effective means of combating unwanted pregnancy. This is unacceptable to many Europeans, both from a moral standpoint and from the point of view of health. This includes the candidate countries, which have not had the opportunity to participate in this debate, and which are therefore having our opinion forced upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people need to be given more information and the wherewithal to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

This is the result of an extremely disturbing false information campaign launched by the right, which must be firmly condemned. The report addresses the sensitive issue of sexual and reproductive health and rights, women’s reproductive health and the dissemination of contraceptive practices, it focuses at length on a policy of health and sexual education policy for young people, and, of course, it is also concerned with unwanted pregnancies and abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is, however, addressed in the context of the recommendations made to the Member States and the candidate countries with the aim of safeguarding women’s reproductive health and rights. The rapporteur makes numerous recommendations regarding prevention. The governments of the Member States and the candidate countries are called upon to endeavour to implement a health and social policy which will reduce recourse to abortion, particularly through the establishment of a network of counselling and family planning services.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes that impartial, scientific information should be provided on reproductive health, including the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. It stresses that interrupting pregnancies should not be promoted as a family planning method and recommends that, in order to protect women’s reproductive health and rights, abortion must be legal, safe and accessible to all.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the experience of the countries which have legislation in place on the interruption of pregnancies reveals that fewer abortions take place if they do not have to be carried out illegally but can be performed in safe establishments under strict medical control without risks to health. In Italy, for example, the abortion rate fell by 40% between 1980 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van Lancker does not undermine the principle of subsidiarity in this extremely balanced report. She does not suggest that the European institutions should take over the competences and responsibilities of the Member States, but recommends that they adopt a policy of prevention – sexual education – and reminds us all that sexuality and reproductive health are, first and foremost, women’s rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must be aware that, when it comes to procreation, in Europe and elsewhere in the world, people do not have a free choice. In order for men and women to obtain that freedom of choice, they must have access to information about the various options possible, and their respective consequences, hence the need for education about sex and the emotions, which plays a very important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Such education, however, is influenced by different political, cultural and family contexts, so there is a lot at stake. We need to make room for a possible debate which respects individuals and their cultures, a debate in which respect for each individual must force us to provide the sort of education which tackles all the issues, and which always provides full information.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, in many countries, public policies aim to give women autonomy by means of a series of measures, including education, which must cover all areas of life if it is to be a tool of democracy. To exclude certain aspects is to practise censorship, to deliberately withhold knowledge and to fail to respect individuals’ capacity for free choice. To bring laws and real life closer together is to organise the emancipatory evolution of a society. This is yet another signal, another project which Europe is able to achieve and of which we can be proud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, it is not a case of barbarians on one side and civilised people on the other, of reactionaries on one side and progressives on the other, of the moral on one side and the immoral on the other. The debate should proceed in an atmosphere of mutual respect, and on that score we should thank both Mrs Van Lancker and the shadow rapporteur from our Group, Mrs Müller, for the way in which they have worked together. The fact remains, however, that this debate is out of time. Even Mrs Van Lancker recognises this in her report, and I quote, ‘... the legal or regulatory policy concerning reproductive health falls within the Member States’ sphere of competence’. The proposed resolution that we are discussing today, no doubt authorised, wrongly, by Parliament’s Bureau in the context of our institution’s right to take the initiative, does not seem to me to be well-founded. It seems to be even less well-founded if we remember that just one month ago – and we really are being paradoxical here – we voted in favour of the Lamassoure report on the division of competencies into what falls within the remit of the Community and what is the responsibility of the Member States, and we should apply what we voted for to ourselves. That is the first reason why I shall not be voting in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">My second reason is that I do not know how we can impose standards in every area. There are a certain number of cultural differences, but what is a good standard? Let me give you an example. In France, we have introduced legislation governing the morning-after pill. Suppose we were to take French legislation as our basis. It is entirely unsatisfactory. Why is that? It is because at the present time the morning-after pill is authorised in France and is distributed exclusively in schools. It cannot be authorised in hospitals. Yet schools operate for 150 days out of 365. Shall we take other legislation as our basis? We shall still find that there is something missing from the framework. What, then, is the framework for good practice?</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which really concerns me, is that I believe that at the present time, the combination of the recommended longer period during which abortion will be allowed and the progress being made in science which means that potential anomalies in unborn children can be diagnosed increasingly early, plus the progress being made in bio-ethics, carries with it a risk. A certain number of doctors, and by no means the least progressive – I am thinking, in the case of France, for example, of Professor Nisand – would agree with me on this point, and the risk is that this combination of circumstances might lead, tomorrow, either directly or indirectly, somewhere, to a system of State eugenics which would prejudice the founding of a peoples’ Europe which is what we are all hoping to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have lied to us, manipulated, blackmailed and coerced us, and have even claimed that abortions lead to breast cancer. We have been put under an intolerable amount of pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Van Lancker report aims to eradicate certain inconsistencies, such as only giving the right to choose to women who are wealthy, and denying this right to all those who are not. Women of a high socio-economic class are able to solve the problem. It is women with fewer opportunities who still have a problem. The report also exposes the hypocrisy of failing to provide sufficient sex education and then refusing the possibility of abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Spanish women used to travel to London to have abortions. Now Portuguese women travel to Spain. Is this right? Is it sensible or fair? Does it make any sense in the context of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The Van Lancker report provides guidelines with a view to reducing the number of abortions that take place. Better prevention and education will lead to fewer abortions. The Van Lancker report is balanced and the rapporteur has been flexible and generous with the right-wing groups in negotiating amendments, yet the representatives of the Left do not want to know. They do not understand, probably because they do not stay for the debates – they just give their opinion and leave.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that many women in the European Union and from outside the Union are awaiting the result of this report. The report must be adopted by Parliament, as many women are awaiting its guidance, and all those who have been using blackmail need to learn their lesson, namely that, on Thursday, this Parliament will adopt Mrs Van Lancker’s excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been stated before, Europe has no competence in this area. It is also surprising because, last year, the Socialists and Liberals refused a debate on a topic which is just as ethical and sensitive, namely euthanasia, on the grounds that a debate on such a topic was reported not to fall within the European remit. This time, just before enlargement, an initiative report is being placed on the agenda with major implications for the candidate countries, but without their involvement. This is about them but without them. This will do little to instil faith in the democratic decision-making process in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Acceptance of the report jeopardises the enlargement process. Mrs Doyle has already stated this. Poland, the referendum in Ireland, and other instances spring to mind. I hope that everyone who votes tomorrow is acutely aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received many negative reactions from various European countries, in eastern and western Europe alike, and even today from the European Forum of National Laity Committees in Erfurt.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic is important and is tied in with a number of topical issues, such as the increase in sexually transmitted diseases, the large number of unwanted pregnancies, also among young people, the large number of legal and illegal abortions and any adverse effects on women afterwards, the importance of relationships and family, the importance of education in this area, etc. Unfortunately, this report – certainly the original version – largely disregarded these issues. Contrary to what is being said here, this report was mainly about the right to abortion and contraceptives, their availability – preferably for free – and information about them. The paragraphs bear this out. There is hardly anything about the aforementioned points, about possible prevention of unwanted pregnancies or, for example, the responsibility of men in this. I am pleased that at least these amendments, tabled by our group, have been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The report should not have been put on the agenda because the topic does not form part of our competence. Moreover, I do not think this is a good report for a variety of reasons. Despite the few improvements, it is too one-sided and sometimes incorrect, in my view. It is incorrect where the report is too positive about the results of the far-reaching, liberal abortion laws and easy access to contraceptives. Research has shown that these are no guarantee for a low abortion rate.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report is inherently flawed. It believes abortion legislation to be a competence of the Member States, but wants abortion legalised in all countries. On behalf of those who referred to this as right-wing propaganda a moment ago, I should like to read out a section of Paragraph 12: “... recommends that abortion should be made legal, safe and accessible to all”.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that there is insufficient statistical data, but does draw conclusions and comparisons. Above all, it bears witness to an image of man which does not appeal to me. It has only been written from the perspective of rights, and not from the perspective of responsibilities. Our group has tabled compromise amendments which would trim the sharp edges. I gather that the Socialists and Liberals cannot accept many of these. They want their own opinion expressed by the Parliament, even if the topic does not fall within our remit, even if it jeopardises the accession process and even if it is patronising towards the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have sympathy for many of the problems, but it is beyond me why this report should be on our agenda at this time. We have taken the wrong turning for a serious problem. It is a political move lacking in strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ms Van Lancker’s report addresses a range of important issues which are amongst the most sensitive and significant health and ethical issues facing our societies today. At the outset, let me acknowledge the efforts that have been made by the rapporteur to respond to the legal order of the European Union. As the rapporteur rightly acknowledges, the European Union does not have competence to engage in health care delivery. This is clear from the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty sets out in Article 152(5) that “Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.” Therefore, I would underline, as does the report, that the delivery of health care falls within the responsibility of Member States. This also applies to the policy of delivery of sexual and reproductive health services.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I note, as Ms Van Lancker has said, that the vast majority of recommendations in the report are directed to Member States and accession countries. It will be a matter for them to consider how to respond most appropriately in line with their own constitutional and legal frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me avail of this opportunity to underline that the Commission has no ambition to become engaged in health care delivery systems or medical care. At present we do not have the power to do so. I do not envisage this situation changing in the future. Subsidiarity is the underlying principle in the delivery of health services and this should be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear. The Commission will not be making any proposals in areas relating to the delivery of health services. This is the responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So whilst a full and frank debate about key health issues is essential, we must also respect the distinction between Member States' and Community competences when we begin to consider general recommendations in sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there are important cultural, ethnic, ethical and religious differences between our citizens on such matters. In highlighting the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights, sensitivity needs to be shown to the divergent attitudes on issues such as abortion in our Member States. Sexual and reproductive health issues are core topics of social and public health debate in Europe today. These issues touch the lives of our citizens in a way that other issues never could. For this reason they are issues best decided as close as possible to those affected. But in the context of developing a public health policy, there are a number of issues which require careful consideration and analysis. And reports, such as the one under discussion tonight, provide insight into the complex issues affecting today’s policymakers.</p>
<p class="contents">In all aspects of sexual and reproductive health, the more informed and the better educated the individual, the greater is the chance that they will avoid pitfalls, by taking responsibility for their health and wellbeing. Of course, in often very difficult real life situations, individuals must move from absorbing information to developing a holistic understanding of how these issues impact upon their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, in this debate, there is significant attention addressed to the responsibility and rights of women in dealing with their health and wellbeing. I believe however, that greater attention needs to be brought to bear on the responsibilities of men in this domain. Too often we overlook the importance of improving men’s education so as to change behaviour, attitudes and involvement. I hope that our Member States will place a greater emphasis on the education and information of men in this important area.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1997 Commission Report on the State of Women’s Health in the European Community also provided some useful analysis. It drew attention to the fact that sexual and reproductive health issues are vital questions for women of reproductive age. Work on public health indicators is ongoing within the European Commission. Experts are developing indicators, which will provide the basis for gathering and analysing health information in Europe. These will include a range of indicators addressing various aspects of reproductive and sexual health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to compile and undertake statistical, epidemiological investigations on the basis of collected data. I must stress, however, that the quality of such work will depend on the quality and compatibility of the data provided by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the new Public Health Programme, the third strand will address health determinants through disease prevention and health promotion. This applies also to sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the Health Promotion Programme, accession countries can participate. However, the local health promotion and disease prevention strategy is the responsibility of the Member States. This would include school health education and promotion projects which can draw on the scientific data generated by this analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the "Mexico City Policy" of the US Administration referred to in the report, the European Commission does not see itself in a position to comment or react. This issue is a matter for the US administration to decide. I have therefore restricted my comments today to those areas for which the Commission has competence.</p>
<p class="contents">May I conclude by underlining the importance and sensitivity of the issues under discussion today which have been raised and explored as a result of the work of Ms Van Lancker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
