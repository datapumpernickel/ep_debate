<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Claude Moraes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, this report on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged European Union is an extremely wide report. From the title, Members of this House could see almost immediately that we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs were dealing with two very big areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly we were dealing with extending and deepening the definition of what it means to be a minority in the enlarged European Union. But we were also dealing with unfinished business: we were dealing with the response to the Green Paper on anti-discrimination. Both areas are extremely wide and probably required reports of their own, but we have tried to put these issues together in one report and I hope I have touched on the key issues, however difficult they have been.</p>
<p class="contents">Because this has been a difficult report, I want to thank at the very outset the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues in the Chamber today for all their help in meeting the aims of this report. It has been difficult and there are one or two issues still to be sorted out before the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me return to the substance of this report. I care very passionately about ensuring that there is a definition of what it means to be a minority in the new enlarged European Union. We know that the protection of minorities was part of the Copenhagen criteria for enlargement of the European Union, but equally we realise that there was no real standard for minority rights in the European Union and in Community policy. And because of this gap, we wanted to ensure that this report took at least one step forward in attempting to make that definition.</p>
<p class="contents">That definition is a very wide one. It includes all the traditional definitions that we understood in the existing 15 Member States under Article 13 of the Treaty, where we talked about minorities which suffered from disabilities, the issue of age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin. But in the enlarged European Union we also have to understand that we are talking about traditional minorities: linguistic minorities and national minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to understand the changing nature of the European Union. A recent debate in this House on the Roma identified that minority as probably the largest in the European Union and deserving of a rapid and deep response to the problems that they face.</p>
<p class="contents">So this report tries to take on two areas. I shall deal with each of them. First, the response to the Green Paper and Article 13. Here in my report I find that the implementation and transposition of the existing directives which the Commission brought forward and this Parliament voted through, and the strengthening of legislation in relation to discrimination on the grounds of disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin, was far too slow. Too many Member States have failed to implement existing directives, and although the legislation is very good and some Member States have transposed it, there is insufficient will in the European Union to transpose what already exists. I hope this report will take one step further with the Commission – and I know the Commission has been making strides on this in bringing Member States to account, but I hope that Member States will see for themselves the benefit of transposing this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 13 legislation, the race equality directive and the employment directive are valuable because they can apply equally to the Roma minority, as they do to second or third generation ethnic minority migrants in Britain or France or Italy. And that is the beauty of this legislation: it is easy to transpose. But it needs the political will of the Member States in order to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the definition of minorities, here we have to take seriously the question of traditional, national and linguistic minorities. We have to understand that there are many people in the European Union who want to protect their diversity, but they feel they are a minority and therefore vulnerable. This report seeks to look at those areas, not to impose solutions on Member States, but to have a standard in the European Union that says that if you are a minority you are also a European Union citizen worthy of respect and worthy of carrying on your own cultural traditions, language or whatever it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I want to say that this has been a difficult report but we have to identify that the way any Member State treats its minorities is a measure of how advanced that Member State really is. This is a very important test. We saw it in the Copenhagen criteria and we should see it today: that a Member State can be measured by how it protects its minorities, how it protects diversity within its population. We in the European Union already have the legislation to do this. We must use it, and we must develop a definition of minorities which everyone can accept. There have been difficulties in this report, but I hope that definition will be broadly acceptable to all Members across this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The promotion of fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination and for equal opportunities are a priority for the European Commission. At his own initiative, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, established a group of Commissioners that is to develop the European Union’s policy agenda in these areas. Your report, Mr Moraes, has drawn to our attention the need for further steps to solve the problems of discrimination and the situation of minorities in the European Union. The Commission shares a number of fears mentioned by Mr Moraes and other Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Union’s anti-discrimination regulations are among the most advanced in the world. Two significant directives were adopted in 2000, which ban discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin, religious belief or conviction, age, disability or sexual orientation. These directives extended the broad range of Community regulations in the area of discrimination on the basis of gender.</p>
<p class="contents">As your report correctly noted, our main task will now be to ensure that these regulations work effectively throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe; in other words, that the process of implementing the regulations must be concluded at national level. Certain Member States have, however, failed to meet the deadlines set. The Commission takes its role as a guardian of the Treaties in this area very seriously, and has on a number of occasions taken action against Member States for failing to meet their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must similarly ensure that people are aware of their rights, and that they are able to derive full benefit from them. Awareness-raising is a priority for the Commission, and we therefore propose that the European Union designate 2007 as being the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. This European Year will be an important opportunity to mobilise all participants and to emphasise the benefits of European diversity for the economy as well as for society as a whole. I hope that we shall be able to rely on the support of the European Parliament for this proposal, and on your active participation in this European year.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the European Commission carried out a broad public consultation on the Green Paper on equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged European Union. National bodies, organisations concerned with equality, non-governmental organisations, social partners and the general public sent more than 1 500 reactions. We are very pleased that we can take into account the opinions and reactions of the European Parliament in the questions considered in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Green Paper, the Commission adopted an announcement on non-discrimination and equal rights for all. This announcement describes a framework strategy for future activities in this area. This strategy goes beyond merely protecting the rights of individuals, and explores how the European Union can promote positive measures to support the integration of social groups facing considerable structural obstacles to their participation in society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also assess the potential impact and workability of new measures to complement existing European Union regulations in the fight against discrimination. This study will take account of the relative benefits of legislative and non-legislative measures and the costs and benefits of various alternative policies, as well as the need to take care not to open a discussion on the existing legal framework, which might weaken the current level of protection against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in particular worried about the unusually serious situation concerning the exclusion of and discrimination against Roma communities throughout the European Union, including in the accession and candidate countries. The European Union is now trying to resolve these issues, for example, by using its anti-discrimination legislation and the targeted use of the European Union’s financial resources. This is an area in which the Union cannot act alone, however. A joint effort of international organisations, Member States’ national bodies, and representatives of citizens’ groups is needed. However, I agree that we should evaluate the most effective way of using the Union’s policies and policy programmes to support the inclusion of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President, Mr Barroso, has confirmed, a group of Commissioners dealing with fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities will consider this question at a future meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would be happy if we were in a position today to speak about development, cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and a rational and fair distribution of wealth generated.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, all this looks more like a theoretical approach to reality which, in its every expression, worryingly unfolds more and more forms of discrimination. The vision finds a strong adversary everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely economic liberalisation which is the most basic cause of the exacerbation of economic inequalities, which promotes individual activity to the detriment of social collectiveness. It is economic liberalisation which is the most basic factor, which strengthens xenophobic tendencies, which dynamites industrial relations and creates new armies of the unemployed, which reinforces a particular form of social racism against the elderly and the disabled. It is therefore economic liberalisation which is the most important ally of discrimination, the combating of which needs to be placed at the centre of our political practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also obvious that the recent refusal by the French and Dutch people to accept the draft Constitutional Treaty conceals causes which are closely connected with some of the existing forms of social discrimination, such as unemployment, poverty and anxiety about the future of the welfare state.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, over and above theoretical texts, we need to proceed in essence, in practice. We need to give coming generations a society in which colour, creed, sex, origin or sexual preferences are not reasons for discriminatory treatment. We need to fight for a social Europe which places people first, a Europe of participation which invests in education, full employment, quality of life and the elimination of poverty. We owe it to the children of the entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that several of the reports touch on anti-discrimination, but this one has gone a step further than previous reports. Protection of minorities means more than simply prohibiting discrimination; it takes political thinking a little closer to creating equal opportunities. However, when the two issues are linked together, numerous problems arise, and so the report has ended up rather large; the issue is complex and so the report examines a whole raft of new connections.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals first of all with protection of minorities. Since minority rights are an integral part of human rights and the latter are among the incontrovertible fundamental values of the European region, there is no doubt that the issue on the agenda is unquestionably important and inevitable. In an enlarging Europe, it is only fair that the problem of dual standards should arise in connection with an issue such as this. While the Copenhagen criteria clearly set out EU expectations with regard to protection of minorities, Member States have not so far been obliged to adjust their policy on minorities accordingly. In the new Member States, which have been bringing their policy on minorities into line with Europe prior to accession, there is a danger that a rise in nationalism might not only bring this process to a halt, but also lead to an increase in anti-minority incidents. This is why a monitoring system is indeed needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific problems that arose in the course of preparing the report – problems relating to the varied situation of different minorities on the one hand and the universal nature of human rights on the other – were a clear indication that we need a policy like this within the Union. I strongly endorse the section of the report that emphasises that this policy must be based on the fundamental European principles of subsidiarity and self-governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect one’s representatives and to live as one wishes can have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty is a considerable step forward for European citizens. It shows that the protection of citizens’ rights is at the heart of European integration and Article 1 restates the prime importance of human dignity. The Charter thus also has real legal significance. Let us hope that this will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by my colleague, Mr Moraes, points out the importance of fundamental rights and, in particular, of the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe. We note that, unfortunately, Article 13, which gives the Community the mission of combating all forms of discrimination, and European legislation in this field, have been implemented poorly or partially by the Member States. It is therefore, above all, absolutely necessary to ensure better transposition, better application of European legislation in this field. We also think that effectively combating discrimination goes hand in hand with a common, coherent European integration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, poverty and social exclusion are a form of discrimination and the eradication of poverty must form part of the policy of combating discrimination. We must put in place mechanisms giving people suffering from exclusion and poverty appropriate access to employment and housing and ensuring that they are represented within the political bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has been working on very interesting subjects. With the enlarged European Union we are looking at completely new questions. I have personally come to realise that where the United States might be a melting pot, the European Union is a very rich, colourful and beautiful mosaic of diversity. It is something to be proud of and to cherish. We have taken the first steps on the path of a very important discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has to respect minority rights, but we should not forget that ultimately each citizen is also an individual and each citizen is therefore entitled to the same rights; secondly, that the European Union should respect the cultural identity of minorities and, at the same time, we must ensure that does not prevent full integration and participation in the community.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of non-discrimination, unfortunately after so many years it is still necessary to have this debate. As the previous speaker said, there are still many groups, such as women, who face discrimination and who lag behind.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus, in particular, on one paragraph that raised some concerns: the paragraph on the rights of gay people. We should be fair to ourselves here. Fundamental rights are for all citizens, not just for some groups. If we are serious about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that says we should not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, then we cannot possibly vote for the amendment tomorrow that seeks to delete a paragraph on homophobia and obstacles to freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we talked about terrorism and the right balance with fundamental rights. I would therefore hope that this House will wholeheartedly endorse this report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that in January 1999 when opening an exhibition devoted to European minorities. All of us regularly pass the room where this exhibition took place and which now bears his name.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing today and will tomorrow vote on the report on the protection of minorities and non-discrimination policies, which is absolutely essential for the future of the Union. This report, as adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is an excellent text showing a real ability to develop the Union as an area in which fundamental rights, including minority rights, are protected effectively. Nevertheless this report has been supported by little more than half of the Members of the Committee. Moreover it seems that the same split of opinions is taking place all over Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so? Maybe the reason is that many of us have a differing or indeed no understanding of minority rights. Surprisingly, we have a consensus when it comes to a number of resolutions telling those outside the EU how to respect human rights and develop democracy, yet we are not ready to support the text saying that these rights have to be respected inside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we keep silent when the Member States ignore the spirit of the international treaties protecting human rights, for example, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities?</p>

I imagine that at this very time all Members have been subject to real lobbying by EU citizens, even asking us to scrap some of the paragraphs in the Moraes report.</p>
<p class="contents">We often profess to be champions of the minorities, before then demonstrating such hypocrisy when it is a question of religious freedom or of recognising free movement and homosexual marriages. Some subject-matters are taboo: there is news today, for instance, that even in Catania, a civilised Italian city, an Italian citizen was refused a driving licence on the grounds of being homosexual. I believe that this fact also speaks volumes about the level of guarantees that we have to put in place against discrimination, and that it is also useful to launch an initiative aimed at ensuring that, with regard to minorities, genuine acts of citizenship, and not just tolerance, are guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to the Member States to enact the right sort of regulations. It does not surprise me that Mr Moraes, in his report, concludes that the Member States are dragging their heels when it comes to implementing this policy. Tackling this at EU level does not seem to add any value. Religious convictions are not a personal matter; they must be professed in a community and expressed in one’s attitude to life. The way in which it is suggested in paragraph 22 that in the field of education, discrimination would be on grounds of religion, ignores the meaning of religious conviction for the identity of education.</p>

Protecting fundamental rights, which was a key element in the integration of Europe, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, declared in Nice in 2000, confirm the importance, not to mention the necessity, of a coherent integration policy aimed at protecting minorities and encouraging the integration of non-EU citizens, particularly in the light of the recent enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all agreed in saying that discrimination is a phenomenon that must be fought, that all men and women must enjoy equal rights and that no one must feel discriminated against on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion or any other category. I believe, however, that the social inclusion of immigrants, and the protection of minorities and cultural diversity – priority objectives of the European Constitution – do not always have to be achieved at any price in every case. Allow me to express my doubts about those immigrant communities that show obvious signs of intolerance – not to say contempt – towards the host country, its customs, its history and its culture; about those who demand unwarranted autonomy and consider it their right to not respect the laws of the Member State in which they are staying, often illegally. They are the first not to want to integrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigrants certainly need to be given legal status, allowing those whose situation is in order not to be discriminated against, on condition that they clearly demonstrate their willingness to integrate and to actively contribute to the economic and social development of their host country. In contrast, by guaranteeing every kind of right at any cost – systematically and unconditionally – there is the danger that the only ones who feel discriminated against will be European citizens, who carry out all of their fiscal and social obligations towards the State, respecting its rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must naturally declare my complete opposition to the paragraph on homophobia and gay couples, regarding ‘family’ only in the traditional sense: a male father, a female mother and children as they are born, male or female. The time allocated to me has unfortunately come to an end, but I would have liked to expand on such issues in this House, as I believe is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As chairman of the intergroup for traditional national minorities, I would like to emphasise the following points. Firstly, the European Union has no system for the protection of national minorities. We must draw up legal and political standards for the protection of national minorities and for a monitoring system as Mrs Bauer proposed in her opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must distinguish between the traditional national minorities of Mr Moraes’s report and the migrant minorities of the Council of Europe. I have proposed referring to migrant minorities as new minorities. Fundamental rights are indivisible, but the obligations of the State are different: for traditional minorities, we need to guarantee that their identity and language are protected; for migrant minorities, we need to guarantee that they are integrated into society.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we in the European Union must clarify the relationship between non-discrimination and positive discrimination. We have some non-discrimination clauses, but it is not clear. What is the relationship between equal treatment and preferential treatment? We cannot guarantee the rights of national minorities without preferential treatment or positive discrimination.

New demands are being made of the EU policy on minorities, which is laudably addressed by the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Already, 46 million inhabitants of the EU now have mother tongues other than their countries’ main languages. The fact that the number of MEPs per country decreases when the EU receives new Member States is a problem. Then, linguistic and national minorities are the first to disappear from the European Parliament. Four minorities disappeared as a result of the last enlargement, and the process will continue if measures are not taken. The issue affects the basis of democracy, since everyone should be represented in, and recognised by, the body to whose legislation they are subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur quite correctly says, one prerequisite for an inclusive minority policy is adequate representation in political decision-making. Given the way in which the enlargements are now planned, just about all minorities will disappear from Parliament. That is not desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue could be solved, for example, by the EU establishing 30 parliamentary seats earmarked for national linguistic minorities. Obviously, it could be difficult to decide precisely how these were to be defined, but the problem must not be exaggerated. In most cases, we are concerned with population groups that have recognised status in their countries and that are neither anonymous nor invisible.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s diversity must be made visible. To take away from Europe’s minorities the opportunity of achieving even some fragile representation is a serious matter, affecting the ways in which stability can be secured on our continent. Many wars in Europe have been the result of majorities oppressing smaller groups. I hope that Parliament and the Commission will tackle this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report rightly asserts that minority rights issues have not been high enough on the EU agenda. The report also reflects the massive amount of work required in this area if we are to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality. In my limited time I shall add my voice to two specific calls that the report makes.</p>
<p class="contents">A critical requirement in asserting and protecting minority rights is political will. In this regard I echo the report’s call for speedy progress on the Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. Also essential is the availability of comprehensive, reliable and disaggregated data on discrimination. The report correctly identifies this area as one meriting immediate action.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Moraes and I welcome the report’s assertion that equal treatment is a basic right and not a privilege, that human rights are indivisible and cannot be bought or sold.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ģirts Valdis Kristovskis (UEN).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(LV) </span>Ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the importance of the goals of the report by Claude Moraes and noting the personal sense of responsibility displayed by the rapporteur in seeking out the truth, at the same time it must be said that the process of creating the report has once again clearly demonstrated that, in creating a common minorities and anti-discrimination policy in Europe, it is absolutely vital and essential to take into account the special, unique, historical and political situation of each country; the importance for a country of preserving its identity and its jurisdiction in solving issues regarding minorities and discrimination against them must be respected. As this report was being written, there were on several occasions manifest failures to observe this rule in the proposals submitted by individual Members who are ignorant or inclined to be biased, that is, in the unjust complaints about the policies on minorities implemented by Latvia and Estonia. This is absurd, since the attitude towards minorities in Latvia is no less accommodating than attitudes in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, taking into account these repeated open, unjustified and uninterrupted attacks on the two states who have suffered most of all from the totalitarian Soviet regime, I call upon you to understand and acknowledge, at last, that in different cases a solution to problems must be sought which is not standard but that a minorities policy must be created which is individually tailored to the circumstances of each particular state. Thus, for instance, our colleague Tatjana Ždanoka began with an attempt to include in all possible wordings of the resolution the issue of non-citizens that is peculiar to Latvia: she tried to highlight it and frighten Europe with Latvia’s over 400 000 non-citizens, and she created the situation that in many parts of the text of the report’s conclusion various legal terms and such fundamentally separate concepts as ethnic minorities, immigrants, refugees, stateless persons and non-citizens, which are not one and the same, are nevertheless confused. The result is a reduction in the report’s objectivity and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to remember that the repression and destruction of the indigenous nations of the Baltic peoples, and the in-flows of economic migrants are the reasons why, during the occupation of Estonia and Latvia, the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of these states changed significantly, giving rise to a comparatively large number of non-citizens with foreign ideologies. Latvia has been very fair, and the legislature has, for its part, given special rights to the persons who were settled there during the occupation period – rights to naturalise at any time. The fact that many have not wished to do so should be viewed as the expression of their individual wishes, and not as a complaint against these countries. Not just the number of citizens but also their loyalty, their respect for the country, its language and its values ought to be the criteria for gaining citizenship and consolidating society. Exaggerations should be avoided, and it should be understood that, for example, in the case of Latvia a devalued granting of citizenship under the influence of external pressure would constitute discrimination against the indigenous nation, and its identity and the state’s existence would be at serious risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, the European Union needs to be the strict judge and controller of the conduct of all candidate countries and it needs to do this without the selective sensibilities and calculations which are often dictated by interests and short-term political expediencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of minorities should not be used to promote national interests or undermine other countries. The philosophy of the escalation strategy, which uses religious and ethnic minorities as a battering ram, is a source of tension, conflict and the cultivation of mutual distrust which ultimately turns out to be to the detriment of the minorities themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Minorities in Europe can play a bridging role for the purpose of cooperation and consolidating security. The Moraes report endeavours to give a definition of ethnic minority by referring to the definition of the Council of Europe. I believe, however, that what needs to be added to his report, especially in paragraph 7 on the definition, is a clear reference to the international treaties which regulate questions of religious and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">An international treaty is a sound basis on which to protect the rights of minorities and a secure framework for overturning policies which exploit them for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">With this comment, I should like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the excellent report which he has presented to us and I believe that we should vote in favour of it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be said that no Member State is free from defects when it comes to giving substance to universal human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unity in diversity is not just a slogan. It has to be put into effect because it is essential to human progress in our Member States and, I would argue, to the very survival of the European Union. Mr Moraes has worked hard and produced a well-balanced and very good report. In Ireland we have still not achieved the progress that we need to achieve in relation to women’s equality, travellers’ and gay rights. I know too that other Member States fall far short of granting full citizenship to minorities. I know that this is a particularly sensitive issue in Latvia and Estonia. However, this report does not seek to be censorious; it attempts to approach these problems in a spirit of solidarity and indeed of seeking help for all states to comply with European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge all Members and political groups of this Parliament to support this. I believe it is an excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to touch upon just a few points, if I may.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is really important to support and push through the implementation of European legislation in the individual Member States. It is apparent that there is still much to do, and I want to state clearly that the Commission takes its role as guardian of the Treaty very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the Year of Equal Opportunities, which will give us the chance to raise awareness of these complex and sensitive issues. I should like to conclude by saying that I am convinced that the new strategy adopted by the Commission will provide a suitable framework for future anti-discrimination measures. It is obvious that what is needed is a combination of all available tools, including legislation, and that it is absolutely necessary to focus in particular on those groups that have unfortunately not yet had the opportunity to participate fully in society and the economy.</p>
