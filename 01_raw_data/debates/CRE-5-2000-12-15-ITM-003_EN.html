<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dary (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission proposal aims to bring together under a single instrument the twelve promotion schemes which are currently applied on a sector-by-sector basis with each following its own rules. This approach is a welcome one, and is similar to that already employed to promote agricultural products in third countries. The proposal concerns both product information and production methods. It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities. The idea is to emphasise areas where a European approach is appropriate such as the provision of information on the intrinsic characteristics of products, including quality, nutritional aspects, organic production, etc. This should enable complementary measures to be taken, inevitably producing synergies.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has certain immediate advantages: a single system providing information and promotion for all agricultural products and production methods; measures enabling the rationalisation of proper consumer information on foodstuff products; the decentralisation and general use of specifications for the sectors concerned. However, whilst the proposal as a whole appears relevant and well structured, I consider that it may be appropriate to clarify and improve certain aspects in order to enable the potential benefits to be fully exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Environment did as much, and the text has been enhanced by the proposed amendments which have been adopted. Let me list some of these. We thought it important to include production methods in this information campaign as they are crucial to product quality. I also think it essential to provide for a greater financial contribution by the Community in the event of certain specific circumstances which would justify this, for example, a serious market crisis or marked Community interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the procedures to be followed in applying this regulation, calling on the various existing competent management committees does not seem to me to be the most appropriate approach, given the horizontal nature of this initiative. The establishment of an ad hoc management committee has been proposed, which would have competence for the promotion of agricultural products. Lists and guidelines should be drawn up more regularly. A period of two years has been suggested in order to ensure that the system retains a certain flexibility, the same interval as that proposed for the Commission to issue a report to the Council and to Parliament, assessing the implementation of the proposal and examining, among other things, the utilisation of appropriations and possible budgetary requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, given that it is for the trade bodies to take the initiative with regard to the measures to be proposed, the latter should not be confronted with guidelines that are too inflexible and would them in a straitjacket rather than providing them with a framework. The new arrangements should therefore not become effective until 2002. It would therefore be appropriate to set as the date of entry into force of the regulation the date of adoption of the implementing regulation, so as not to lose the appropriations available in 2001. Finally, a reference to the possibility of actions to promote products of the most remote regions and their logo should be explicitly reinserted into the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus amended, the proposal would deserve our support. A coherent product promotion policy is one of the tools making it possible to put European farm models into practice effectively. It is also a major tool for communication with consumers who, these days, no longer know what food they can trust.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our chairman today reminded us that he was chairing the last sitting of this millennium. Let me draw your attention to the fact that the vote on this report will also be the last one this year. Perhaps this fact will instil a spirit of unanimity in us, which would, doubtless, knowing the great-heartedness of the Commission, lead it to accept all our amendments. Thanks you, ladies and gentlemen, and may I wish everyone in the Chamber today a very happy festive period.</p>

It is still necessary to promote agricultural products, particularly as the price of agricultural products has fallen, and this price reduction has certainly not been fully offset.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Budgets differs from that of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on a number of scores. First of all, the Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that agricultural products not intended for consumption should be promoted as well as those intended for consumption. All agricultural products will need to be promoted. Unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has rejected this proposal. My group has re-submitted it under Amendment No 27, and I would like to recommend it to you warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the standard promotion activities, we believe that a number of aspects will need to be highlighted. Firstly, it should be pointed out how good agricultural products, such as fruit, milk etc. are for you. Another aspect to be highlighted is the animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly production methods used in Europe. How can we explain to European farmers that they are to be ever more restricted in their activities and that they should employ animal-friendly production methods, while at the same time our borders remain open to products from farmers who do not need to use these methods? We need to emphasise the European aspects to the general public. The Committee on Budgets already holds the view that if, in the context of the WTO negotiations in 2003 or later, a number of export refunds and other export amounts are reduced, the European Commission should ensure that a portion of those refunds and amounts are ploughed back into further promotion activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the WTO negotiations we will come under strong pressure to reduce export refunds, and cuts in this sector will be very likely. That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here, and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures. This sector is, of course, included in the "green box", and it would, of course, make it possible for us to present European products on the world market in an entirely new and much more intensive way. I see great opportunities for quality European products here.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately this is also support for rural areas, on which, after all, we spend 10% more today, a sign that these regional economies should also be receiving more support, so that, on the one hand, the theory "think global, act local" can very well be asserted but, on the other, the world market is not disregarded either. It is precisely in the food sector – but also in the agricultural non-food products sector – that we have good opportunities in the future here, and we should therefore make the most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, then, that, in the future, the existing 12 categories of products will not be the only ones to be the subjects of promotional campaigns but that the arrangements will be extended to all agricultural products. So, Mrs Lulling, there will be opportunities here in the future not only for grape juice but also for wine. We should also set ourselves a target. We ought, in fact, to ensure that food production in Europe has an aim, and this actually follows on very well from the preceding debate. You see, we want to use our food to keep people healthy into old age. We want to stay healthy, and food is the overall basis for healthy living. That is why I am also pleased that, this week in the European Parliament, we have set up a working group on biotechnology. We want to address health-related issues in detail. We also believe that particular account ought to be taken here of organic farming and production and that, of course, Europe will be able to make considerable progress on the international scene with its brands and designations of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">A trend which has become increasingly pronounced recently is e-commerce. I believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products. It is expected that, by the year 2003, 80% of the European population will in all likelihood be connected to the Internet. Obviously, this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant, and new opportunities are emerging which, at the end of the day, need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area is, of course, further education and training. I believe that where marketing, sales and training programmes are concerned, life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more, because it is precisely the new technologies – handling product promotion using modern logistics – which will open up entirely new possibilities. Cooperation between industry, agriculture, trade and consumers is therefore of paramount importance here, and I would be glad if we were able to achieve new standards of cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Dary, bravo, you have mastered the art of communication, and this is precisely the reason why you were appointed to draw up the report before us right now.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more serious note, I should like to emphasise the value of this proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market. The rapporteur presented the main points just now. I should just like to add, at this time when BSE is highlighting a number of abuses in forms of agriculture which place the emphasis on high productivity, that it is especially appropriate to raise the profile, within the internal market, of the specific qualities of agricultural products by including, as the rapporteur suggests, indications of production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">For, while European agriculture may reasonably expect to be a force to be reckoned with on international markets, the fact nonetheless remains that its future is still linked to a greater extent to penetration of its own internal market, which comprises 370 million consumers today and will probably number almost 500 million tomorrow. From this point of view, campaigns for information provision and promotion, cofinanced by the European Union and the Member States, are essential both to help restore the somewhat tarnished image of agriculture in the eyes of consumers and, moreover, to bring about recognition of the excellent quality of the very great majority of our agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors. There must be periodic campaigns targeted at specific populations or consumers in general in order to highlight aspects relating to, for instance, food safety, traceability, nutritional quality, the specific characteristics of production methods, or indeed the efforts made to promote animal welfare. And while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers, we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves, who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dary, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has complied with your various recommendations. We now hope that Parliament will fall in line with them across the board, and I, of course, urge my own group to give you its complete support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, today I have rather more time than my group usually allows me. First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his good report. I should not like to discuss the details of the report, however, because it is fine as it stands. After all, colleagues have talked about it. I should just like to express a few simple truths at the end of the year. Firstly, this is about the fact that PR measures are to be implemented to promote the European model of agriculture, as you said. I should like to make it clear in this connection that within this European model of agriculture we still do not have codecision; neither for this report nor for bananas. We write our report, we do our work, and if the Council does not like it then it does what it wants. Progress on this point was not forthcoming in Nice either.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as you know, I remarked rather sarcastically that we had come a step further; the opposite is, of course, the case. I do not think that we should relax our efforts to move towards codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few more truths to tell: if we are talking about PR, but have to tackle BSE, then perhaps it would be a good idea to grasp the fact that cows belong in fields. It is as simple as that. If they had stayed in the fields then we would not have had BSE.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Or what about when people say that we have a shortage of protein? If Parliament's proposals to allow legumes and clover to be grown on set-aside land and be used for animal feed had been implemented – they have been passed by a majority three times here, but that shows yet again how powerless Parliament is – then we would have had more basic rations and more protein feed. Then, you see, the cows would have stayed in the fields and we would not have had to use meat meal as animal feed. A simple truth, if people are now saying that we could not guarantee calf feed because there was no milk replacer feed, is that calves drink milk. If we want something for the machines than surely we can powder whole milk. The practice of mixing a fat into calf feed which comes from meat meal production – which in any case is highly dubious given the risk of BSE transmission – creates in my opinion a centre of infection for young animals. Why do we not say in this case that we will put butter into the calves' feed? After all, we have enough of it. Here, too, the question of the European agricultural model arises.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point concerns aid. There are farms of the same size, not one small and one large but of the same size, where one receives DEM 15 000 per worker and the other receives DEM 150 000 per worker. This means that the second farmer receives more than it costs him to pay his employees. If I received as much as that per worker on my 50-hectare farm, then I would take on five more people. I have to pay the five people whom I employ out of the profits from what I produce and not out of the money from Brussels. We need to agree on social criteria here which guarantee reasonably equal treatment if we are going to assume that agriculture also wants to offer jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, you are familiar with the debate surrounding the new Member States and the question of whether they will receive the compensatory payments or not. If they receive the compensatory payments in the same way as we do here then we will have the same problem, namely that we will not promote job creation but that, basically, we will set in motion a job destruction machine because people want to be able to use the premiums which they draw from Brussels in a lucrative way.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point relates to exports and intervention. Animals are still being transported because we subsidise live exports of calves. If we were to abolish this practice then we would no longer need to talk about these consignments of animals or the pictures with which we are familiar from the media. These are all ways in which we present ourselves to the world, and we come across in a negative, not a positive light.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there are alternatives is something which Mr Garot showed in his report when, for once, with pigs, we tried to develop a market organisation which was actually designed to benefit farming and safeguard farming structures. This does not stand a chance, though. The only ray of hope is the regulation on organic farming and, in Germany, recently, there has been much talk of a superior culture. If we take organic farming as the superior culture of agricultural policy, then I think that we ought to adopt further measures which are basically quite straightforward. This would also make it possible for us to use PR measures to inform the public – including the public outside Europe – about our good food production system and to convince them of its worth.</p>

<p class="contents">I fear too that I am going to disappoint the rapporteur, for there is no unanimous backing for this report. It is about how the system of sales promotion measures is to be changed. I think it is wrong in principle to have such measures in the European Union. It cannot reasonably be the taxpayers’ and the European Union’s business to finance advertising campaigns to encourage people, for example, to buy tulips or eat more apples. This is properly a matter for producers, retailers and trade associations, not the European Union. I think we ought now to have taken the opportunity to phase out the system rather than change and consolidate it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out that there are serious faults in this aspect of agricultural policy. At present, so much support is being given to production that an enormous volume of certain articles is being produced, for which there is no market. There are no purchasers. If agricultural products are not quite simply to be destroyed, this leads to export subsidies having to be introduced, which destroy the agricultural market in other countries, or advertising campaigns financed by taxpayers. The system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the EU’s agricultural policy. I believe it is the fault in the system that ought to be tackled. No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand, and the latter must not be advertised. There are too many elements of the planned economy in this system. I shall therefore be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a child, my father was quite fond of talking himself. He used to accuse me of wanting to have the last word. It appears that I am having the last word here not only in this debate but in the millennium from the floor of this House, so he would be quite proud of me if he was still alive.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we have had widely divergent views expressed here. I want to congratulate the Commission on bringing forward this proposal. The rapporteur has researched this area very thoroughly and made an excellent report even if I might not agree with all of it, and he pointed out that it seems we did not do so well in the past. Spending under the last programme actually fell between 1997 and 1998. We have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the European Union to take up the money that was available. Obviously, we have some learning to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we should spend money on this subject. The consumers need correct information and they need reassurance. I sincerely hope that it is not anyone's ideological view of what is safe and right that will be put forward, but information with a proper scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Organic farming is fine as far as it goes. I have nothing against it. I was an organic farmer myself at one time, because everyone was an organic farmer when I started farming at 15 years of age, which is some time ago. What the consumers of Europe should understand today is that food was never so cheap as it is now. It was never so plentiful as it is now. It was never as safe as it is today in spite of some of the problems that still exist and will probably continue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point we should remember. Everyone in Europe has enough to eat for the most part. Everyone has sufficient food, so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product. The European Commission has to be extremely careful. If dairy products and beef, on which we spend an awful lot of money and indeed sheepmeat as well, although we do not have surpluses of it, are advertised with public money to compete with products which are not subsidised like pig meat and poultry meat, then obviously we are upsetting the balance of the market and doing an injustice to some of our producers. We must be extremely careful about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig points out that there are so many things we can sell abroad. That is extremely important because, as time goes by, we will not be allowed to continue our old practice of producing low-quality products and selling them highly-subsidised, unprocessed and with no value added on foreign markets. In a world where the population is growing by 80 and 90 million a year, there must be a market for European food, because no place in the world is better suited to the production of food and no farmers in the world know better how to respond to opportunities than European farmers. There must be a future there. Mr Mulder is right when he said that the common agriculture policy is designed not only for food but also for the social objective of keeping the maximum number of people in rural areas. By using modern technology and using modern science and modernising our industry, we have made food available to the poor at the right price. This was never done when we were producing organically.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if we can produce and promote food that is better for the environment and takes animal welfare into consideration, and sell that on world markets, then we will be really fulfilling the vocation for which the common agricultural policy was intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks also go to the other Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as well as to the other committees which have worked on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed measures are intended to replace the 12 sectoral promotional schemes which the Council has adopted over the years. The existing schemes, which lacked uniformity, will thus be harmonised and simplified. We are adopting the same concept of promotion here which is already applied outside the European Union. The Union is thus providing itself with a flexible promotional tool in the internal market too, which can be used across the board. This means, therefore, that the old product-based strategy is being replaced by an approach with a greater thematic emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">These promotional campaigns at European level can usefully complement Member States' measures by taking up the following themes: for example, quality, nutritional aspects, food safety, labelling, traceability, protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, organic or integrated production methods, and so on. This would considerably improve the identity of European products in the eyes of consumers, and we certainly agree that this is necessary because consumers are, as we know, becoming increasingly discerning in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept of thematic information provision and promotional measures complementing national and regional measures requires strong commitment on the part of the Member States, in the form of co-financing and support for administering and monitoring the measures to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Having analysed the amendments, we can distinguish three groups: firstly, amendments which the Commission can accept; secondly, amendments which are superfluous because the proposal is worded in such general terms – as befits a framework regulation – that they are actually already covered; and thirdly, a group of amendments which the Commission also rejects because they either do not fit into this proposal or would have undesired consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 10, which call for information on the production methods used for agricultural products and foods to be included in campaigns of this kind. As regards Amendment No 5, which calls for general guidelines by means of which only the essential elements of the programmes concerned are defined, the Commission is open to the possibility of including this idea in the wording of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the proposal. It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years, so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool. These are the amendments which the Commission can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the amendments which are already covered by the proposal and are therefore not accepted. These are the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31 and 32. The Commission quite understands the thinking behind these amendments, but we feel that the general nature of this draft regulation is sufficient. Moreover, some of these ideas will be taken up again in the implementing provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment briefly on the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 28. An explicit reference to regional origin or other specific information would excessively limit the scope of the regulation. Amendment No 25 must also be rejected. Regarding the issue of when the new arrangements should come into force, the Commission is, however, prepared to consider transitional arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The final group of amendments which the Commission cannot accept are amendments which are at odds with the proposal, those which could have unwelcome consequences and those in which administrative procedures are proposed which are not customary practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the amendments one by one. Amendment No 1 is legally incorrect because Article 299 of the EC Treaty can only be applied for derogations from other articles of the EC Treaty. This is not the case here. Amendments Nos 3, 16 and 17 and the second part of Amendment No 24 could give rise to misunderstandings about the aims of our promotion policy. Amendments Nos 6 and 33 cannot be accepted because, given the limited funds available, they would make the EU share of the co-financing simply too great. They would also reduce the other partners' share of the responsibility. All we can say to Amendments Nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up, and Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought, is that the Commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support. Consequently, thanks to your help and your opinion, the Community will soon be in a position to implement an important new promotional tool. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to do so now. The second point that I wanted to make is that despite the critical remarks which, as you know, I also made clearly in my speech, we are glad that this report has been adopted and that the Commission is getting this scheme off the ground. Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture. All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right. And people should do so on special occasions. But this does not in any way change what I said clearly just now, that we also need to pay attention to the small details, that we must not forget the superior culture of a European agricultural policy which is geared towards social and ecological concerns, and that we should always check measures to ensure that they are also having the desired effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to follow up on one further point. To return to set-aside, if you looked, you would be able to see that, in practice, set-aside is not caused by crop rotation, but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals. This means that the whole point of set-aside, which was originally intended in 1992 to make crop rotation more environmentally friendly, is turned completely on its head. Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice. That was my petition this morning. I wanted to point this out. Now that we are all convinced that we need to reach a turning point in agricultural policy, I hope that we will also sit down together and do our homework so as to put right these small details, something which is urgently necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">When we discussed the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine in this House, we tabled amendments in an – unfortunately unsuccessful – attempt to insert a chapter on the promotion of wine products into this organisation of the market. I now have some small consolation, because we must not, in third countries where there is a demand backed by purchasing power for high quality wine products, leave the field clear for the wine producers of some third countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States, to name but a few, who have considerable amounts to spend on promoting their products, with far fewer constraints and regulations than those we impose on our own wine growers, who are occasionally victims of unfair competition, especially with regard to registered designations, even when they are not, as in some Member States, subjected to a policy of exorbitant taxation on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must promote the moderate consumption of wine, whose medicinal properties have been known since ancient times. In those times, the Rule of Saint Benedict required monks to drink one ‘hemina’, or about half a pint, of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is scientific proof that moderate consumption of wine is one of the best ways of preventing cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's disease and many other illnesses. Any money will therefore be well spent, and I hope that the Commission will not be so stingy with these appropriations as it has been, once again, with the appropriations for honey and for bees, when my amendments, even though they had been adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, were not adopted by the Commission, the Council or our own Committee on Budgets. I really must protest about that, as it was only 15 million. This is really peanuts, and I therefore hope that the Commission will not prove to be as stingy with its funds in this instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings. I believe that the issues which have been debated at these Friday sittings have definitely been of strategic significance for Europe. I should like to make one further request of the French Presidency: that Mr Moscovici – because he has given really extremely brief and sometimes imprecise answers to questions here – answer these questions fully and in writing for the European Parliament, because for us, good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament means that we face each other as equals and that each takes the other seriously. That is why I would also be interested to know whether the issue of Friday sittings was discussed at the Nice Summit, that is whether it was of importance or insignificance to the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to the House, to all of my colleagues, to all of the ushers and also to the President. I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and hope that we will all meet again next year in good health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should not just be edible agricultural products which are in the limelight. We must continue to refer to the Internal Market principles in our policy, including public health. I am pleased with the fact that non-food products, in addition to food products, are now being taken into consideration. I can fully concur with the view taken by my colleague, Mr Jan Mulder, in this respect. However, in the long run, we will need to aim for an independent agricultural sector which can survive on its own within the market.</p>
