<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the European Union already has a quarter of a century of legislative tradition which obliges it to take equality between women and men in working life seriously. The directive under discussion today took on its original form as early as 1976. We can state that in over a quarter of a century our societies have developed considerably in many respects and it is time to revise our view of equality between women and men at work to meet the requirements of today. The Treaty of Amsterdam also obliges us to do so, as it lays down that equality between women and men must be broadly taken into account in all the work of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now facing entirely new challenges which we must tackle through legislation. In this directive the European Union presents for the first time actions binding on Member States to prevent sexual harassment which is prevalent in the workplace. In this respect, I can also state that research shows that one in two women in the European Union has suffered sexual harassment at work. It is quite clear that from time to time this can also affect men; men can also be the victims of sexual harassment but as a rule, however, still today the victims are mainly women. In this respect, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities suggests that we go a little further than the Commission originally intended. The Committee would like the Member States to start preventive work to prevent sexual harassment and for employers to be obliged to create working conditions in which sexual harassment is unlikely. I have also emphasised the fact that this may improve the position of the employer, since if employers can show that they have initiated such preventive work, they will surely be in a stronger position should conflict arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Maternity protection also needs strengthening. I myself am from Finland and it is often thought that Finland is a model country in terms of equal opportunities. However, I can say that in our country too women around the age of thirty, for example, are having abortions more often than should be the case. Research carried out into the reasons behind this found that this may be due to there being so much competition in the workplace. Employers discriminate against women who are at an age where they are likely to have children. We would like to put a stop to this once and for all. This is sexual discrimination, which is banned.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive also gives the victims of sexual discrimination stronger legal protection and also requires that victims of sexual discrimination are still able to take legal action even once a working relationship has been terminated. Here they can receive support from an independent body, which this directive requires be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that such independent bodies for equal opportunities already exist in most Member States but I would like to emphasise the importance of this issue when considering candidate countries. In another context the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has focused considerable attention on the fact that issues concerning equality between women and men in candidate countries have not been as strongly emphasised in accession negotiations as they should have been. This can also be strengthened by creating sufficient institutions whose task, according to the law, is to ensure that equality is achieved and even promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that social development has brought with it new types of equality issues. There was a great deal of discussion within the Committee on whether young men and fathers need stronger protection against sexual discrimination. I believe that we have reached a good compromise in including fathers and their rights in this directive. In my opinion, this is highly appropriate at a time when the equal opportunities discussion has largely moved towards looking at how men can take part in realising their family responsibilities. In this way, we will be able to head towards real equality.</p>

Forty per cent of the growth in women’s employment is due to part-time and independent work, which receives minimal wages. Although this is an alternative to unemployment and may help reconcile work and family life, it nevertheless creates a new form of discrimination, which is not sufficiently described by the statistics. One example of this is the recruitment of over-qualified people for less high-powered jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds must provide an incentive to the social partners to adopt agreements on equality. The Lisbon Council decisions, the broad employment guidelines for 2001, the Social Agenda and the new provisions of the Treaty all define the importance of increasing employment amongst women, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, not simply to comply with a law, but mainly for the sake of economic balance and to ensure that pensions are sustainable. What is important is to get the overall picture correct, even if we achieve this in a roundabout way.</p>
<p class="contents">The texts submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs propose new formulae for the concepts of positive action, of indirect discrimination, which victimises one or more individuals and of harassment as a phenomenon of domination and humiliation with or without direct sexual abuse. I would put it like this: we are opting for an approach that we consider to be more wide-ranging and more appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of this committee were unanimous in extending protection for maternity and paternity leave, for adoption and during pregnancy and, once again, we recommend, as Parliament has done, that Directive 92/85/EC be revised. The right to return to work laid down in Directive 76/207/EEC – and on this point we disagree with Mrs Hautala’s report – must enable women, in order to protect their job following maternity leave, to take up an equivalent position in the event that their job changes or becomes defunct.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission believed that it was doing the right thing by submitting a proposal to us in 1996 to amend that directive – a directive which at least had the great advantage of encouraging, in practical terms, equality between men and women in the workplace, in the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment proposed in 1976 was intended solely to safeguard positive actions, which were put at risk by the 1975 judgement. As the rapporteur on that proposal, which failed to reassure me, I believed I was doing the right thing, this time, in waiting for another ruling by the Court of Justice in a similar case, the Marshall case. This ruling was issued in November 1997 and, this time, was not in favour of Mr Marshall, who felt that he was being discriminated against when a positive action was taken in favour of a female colleague. We looked at certain aspects again, to determine whether or not positive actions are, in fact, discriminatory, because there had been this U-turn on the part of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, on the basis of the truism that we are all in the hands of God, whether at sea or in court, Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities was, at the time, willing to support me in asking the Commission to withdraw its proposal, which was considered to be inadequate, particularly because the Treaty of Amsterdam had since been signed. On 8 March 1999, therefore, we asked the Commission, here in Parliament, to withdraw its proposal and to submit to us a new one based on the ratified Treaty of Amsterdam. We explained this request, emphasising that under Articles 2, 3 and 141 of the Treaty of Amsterdam the right to equality between men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, which requires equality to be achieved by a series of real steps towards positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message was clear: the proposed directive should contain an imperative legal mandate to take positive measures whenever they are necessary in order to achieve equality between men and women and to remedy the under-representation of women in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission braced itself for the task. It is already coming up to a year since it submitted a proposal to us to amend the 1976 Directive. Personally, I should have preferred the Commission to present us with an entirely new version, rather than piecemeal amendments here and there, because the Commission’s text gave rise to almost 200 amendments by the rapporteur and the various committees involved, and these were often drawn up without reference to the basic text, and with the intention, albeit worthy, of trying in that directive to reinvent the entire policy on equality in a number of other fields covered by other directives. One might rightly regard these other directives as being in need of improvement, but this amendment has nothing to do with those directives.</p>
<p class="contents">This did not make my task, as the previous rapporteur and as the notional rapporteur, for my group this time, any easier, because unfortunately I was not prepared to forget the message I referred to earlier in the context of my 1999 report. Personally, I take the view that the text proposed by the Committee on Women’s Rights has taken too much on board, and in some places, it is not very stable, in legal terms; it does not demonstrate the responsible attitude which the Council and the Commission are entitled to expect from their co-legislator, namely Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to make people see reason, but I have been only partially successful. In particular I regret those amendments, which disregard Article 141 of the Treaty. I regret the amendments that introduce so-called definitions. I regret the muddle over maternity protection, and the confusion between maternity leave for women and parental...</p>

The last speech showed how intense the discussion within the Committee on Women’s Rights was, because it is quite true that the 1976 directive played a remarkable role, but 25 years have passed and both social behaviour and the role of women have changed. Behind us we have numerous decisions of the Court of Justice but, most importantly, we have the Treaty of Amsterdam which, from the legal standpoint, gives us the opportunity to consolidate and make more effective the legal instruments which, as we are quite aware, are instruments, but vital instruments for implementing active policies and for putting the principle of equal opportunities into practice, even as regards access to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The temptation to try to use this amendment to the directive to tackle many of the problems facing women has been great – in this respect Mrs Lulling is right – but I believe that the result of our labours is, from a legal standpoint, absolutely consistent with the proposals and objectives of the draft amendment that the Commission presented to us. I believe the definitions of ‘direct discrimination’ and ‘indirect discrimination’ which we have taken from the Commission proposal and improved upon are such as to make the use of this instrument clear at a legal level. The inclusion of harassment and sexual harassment as elements of discrimination is, without a shadow of a doubt, equally clear, as is also the clarification that the right to maternity, like the right to paternity, cannot be used as an instrument for enforcing discrimination. The possibility of putting into practice positive actions like, indeed, the possibility given to us by Article 141(4) of the Treaty, is, I believe, an equally clear instrument, so that the directive – which I hope will be operational by the end of this year and will be an instrument at the service of all the Member States, all women, all organisations – may truly become one more instrument added to those that the European Union has for all these years placed at the service of so many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody raised the point that the European Union might interfere more than it should do under the principle of subsidiarity. Well, in my opinion, not even this could ever be used as an excuse by anybody, because the legal instruments that can be adopted are specified here and in some cases there are obligations associated with them and in others opportunities, depending on the laws of the Member States. But I believe and hope that, today, the House will, by a large majority, approve Mrs Hautala’s proposal, which has the consensus of the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women’s Rights, because I feel that this, too, will be a step forwards in making one of the basic principles of our Community – the principle of equal opportunities – become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, I hope that her efforts will be rewarded at eleven o’clock, since a report in which so much hard work has been invested and about which there should be a large measure of agreement, must be assured of a sizeable majority in this Parliament. You can count on my group at any rate.</p>
<p class="contents">When people ask me what the value added of Europe is, it is always very easy simply to give the examples of what Europe has done to promote equal rights for men and women. A great deal has already changed, including in my own country, the Netherlands. We sometimes think that we are in the vanguard, but the truth is far from that and a great deal still needs to change. This revision is very important in that respect and accordingly I am glad that this is now going ahead in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, sexual harassment at work must be outlawed. It is terribly difficult to combat. Victims feel they are alone. It really is a major step forward that this will now be regarded as discrimination, because that allows us to deal with the problem better. But of course the saying “prevention is better than cure” applies here too. And if companies are now obliged to take preventive measures, that simply means that this problem, if things go well, will be banished.</p>
<p class="contents">Motherhood will be better protected by this legislation, since it is unfortunately still the case that with applications or career decisions, employers still weigh up whether they will be “losing” a woman for a time, because that is how they still see it, to maternity leave. The only way of ensuring that such weighing up no longer takes place and that that form of discrimination disappears is to ensure a much better distribution of care responsibilities between men and women. That is also the reason why our group feels it is important that paternity leave can be claimed by men, and that if that option does not exist, this is simply another case of discrimination. Hence our amendment. I must say that I was surprised that Christian Democrats in the women’s committee tried to remove it. My understanding was that there is now a pact on the matter. I hope that this is indeed the case, and that at eleven o’clock it will prove so and that at eleven o’clock we shall all be here and we will be able to give a very clear signal that fathers should be entitled to leave too.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, a few words about the exemplary role that European institutions could play in this. I mean the intended amendment of the terms of employment of employees of institutions like, for example this Parliament, and also the Commission. If we look at opportunities for maternity leave in the European institutions, we see that the situation is depressing. I hope that the Commissioner will be able to point out to her colleagues that they have an important function in showing that we, at any rate, do things in a certain way in these institutions and can use this to give an important signal to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In almost all the Member States, unemployment rates are higher for women than for men. The difference in employment rates between the sexes is an average of around 20% in the Member States. Employment among women decreases according to the number of children that they have. Women do the majority of non-paid work in the home, including caring for children and other dependants. Even in countries that have high employment rates, women are over represented in part-time jobs, in many cases not out of choice. Moreover, the differences in salary between men and women are still considerable: 28% for medium term at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it says that here in Europe, the champion of human rights, women do not have the same rights in practice as men, they are still less represented in public institutions and in decision-making positions in private entities, and they are still the prime victims of ill treatment within couples and of sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that women cannot be truly free and equal to men until they have the same opportunities to get a job, are paid the same salary and gain true financial independence. Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved, the other inequalities will also have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Lisbon European Council has stated an objective of increasing the Community average rate of employment among women from the current level of 51% to above 60% by 2010. But when I think that, for example, in Spain the level of women in employment currently scarcely reaches 35%, I think that it is not going to be 10 but 20 years before we can talk about real equality between the sexes, especially if the shortages of jobs in general continue to be so great.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is time that we took ourselves more seriously, for example, the proposals from Orio Giarini and Patrick Liedtke, and their Report to the Club of Rome, entitled "The employment dilemma: the future of employment" –where they advocate the division of the working day, or the proposals of Peter Hall that focus taxation on business consumption and remove the burdens from the cost of labour factor.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge of equality is above all the challenge of employment. I therefore welcome the initiative to modify Directive 76/207/EEC, from 25 years ago, on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I also congratulate Mrs Hautala, chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on her excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine it has not been easy, as rapporteur, to reconcile all views, although the majority of people taking part in the work were women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that reality is often ahead of legislation. I would also like to emphasise that legislation is often not sufficient, but must be supplemented once we have a law. I would therefore highlight the need for plans regarding equal opportunities and for employer responsibility in a modern society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ghilardotti said that women’s role has changed in the last 25 years, but so has that of men and consequently also working life. I believe the last remaining bastions will soon be employers and their organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked a great deal about sexual harassment. This concept is difficult to define, but Swedish lawyers are currently trying to come up with a definition of undesirable, unwelcome behaviour in the workplace by one person towards another. It is exciting to define phenomena which, though they are old, are only now being highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also talked about paternity leave. I would like to point out that one does not choose to be a parent – a parent is something you are once you have become one. When employing new staff, employers ask applicants whether they will become or plan to become parents. Working life is part of life, not all of it. This is true for both women and men, as well as for children. I hope that the vast majority will back Mrs Hautala’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is often done in a bureaucratic way, always in an attempt to draw up a law, a directive or a new imposition. The 1976 directive played a fundamental role – and I do not want to dwell on this – but the attempt being made today with this report, with this directive, to enhance the implementation of equal opportunities through legal instruments may, I feel, take us down the wrong road, where the benefits run the risk of being more than counterbalanced by the harm done.</p>
<p class="contents">The reversal of the burden of proof, for instance, goes against the liberal principles of the rule of law for the sake of the cause to be attained. The legitimisation of positive actions, for instance, must be tied to an assessment of their duration and of proportionality. The creation of independent national bodies – this is true in this case but, in my view, it is true in all other cases too – that deal with pre- or para-judicial tasks, would incomprehensibly duplicate traditional means of judicial redress.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to access to the labour market, then, I believe that, first of all (this is true for the Italian situation) some measures must be considered that are wholly conventional – flexibility of the labour market, reviews of social spending, wholly absorbed, for example, by social security spending – measures that would address, and to a great extent are already addressing the issue of equal opportunities in the labour market, but without any need for new laws or new bureaucracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is essential that we should know what we are talking about, because it is very difficult to form a clear opinion on your report, since it contains so many statements that are vague, contradictory, or even absurd, like Amendment No 69, according to which it would be better to talk about ‘parental leave’ for mothers or fathers. How can we dare talk about equality if we tolerate exceptions such as Amendment No 10 or Amendment No 24? When we talk about equality, we are recognising the equal dignity of every human being, whether man or woman. When we talk about equality, we are recognising the special nature of men and women in the organisation of society. This special nature leads to a complementary relationship between men and women, rather than rivalry. I can only express my astonishment that this report, at the committee stage, was voted for by women only. So much for equality!</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the men who have had the courage to stand up and speak this morning. I am also amazed that Amendment No 40 gives associations the right to go to court without making it compulsory to have the consent of the victim in a case of discrimination. Who are these associations? Surely it is the role of the state to see that the law is applied, and that it is not distorted?</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly are we envisaging for the future? We must break away from this dialectic which promised us women’s liberation but did not propose anything other than competition with our male partners so that we become superwomen. We are not clones of men, we are not merely cogs in the production system. We cannot separate women’s rights from the recognition of woman’s special nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Our society is aspiring towards a new feminism. We are women, wives and mothers. As women, we want to develop according to our own model, our sensitivity, our intuition and our intelligence. Man can never be the sole reference for the development of the human being. As wives, the complementary role of men and women implies the need for cooperation in professional life, in social life and in family life. As mothers, we hold the future of humanity in our hands, and you are right, Mrs Hautala, when you stress that nothing must be allowed to prevent a woman from giving the gift of life. So I say yes to equality between men and women, but at the same time, we must respect the special nature and the dignity of both. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The modifications are presented taking into account the Treaty of Amsterdam and the rulings of the Court of Justice in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea is to adapt the directive to social reality and to take up the demands of women to solve the problems of different treatment in the workplace. For the first time it is considered that sexual harassment in the workplace is discrimination on the grounds of sex. We request preventive measures and measures to help women whose working lives and professional careers are damaged due to sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be highlighted that the amendments introduced give support to women regarding pregnancy and maternity, guaranteeing that they can return to their jobs and benefit from any improvements that may have taken place during their absence. The positive action measures to balance out their representation in the different employment sectors will also be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Women, especially younger women, now have a high level of professional qualifications, but this is not reflected throughout their working lives, as in general they are in lower-qualified posts that do not enable them to fully achieve their professional expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will help solve these problems, but it is the Member States, through their national legislation, which ultimately need to ensure that women can work full-time without their personal or family lives being badly affected as a result. Those of us who think that we need to support the family know that it is essential to start by supporting women in order to enable them to reconcile family and working life as a principle of Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that it has genuinely been difficult working on this proposal, but we have made an effort to highlight the points of agreement and the objectives of the directive over and above the logical differences between different political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendment of the directive comes at the right time now that we finally have a sound legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and it contains more detailed provisions to protect women from discrimination in their professions and in the workplace. In my view, this is a genuine building block and a contribution to the overall strategy of gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">With our amendments to the text proposed by the Commission, the directive's scope of application becomes broader and more specific. We put forward practical definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace. For the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace is recognised as discrimination on grounds of sex, and our amendments offer women workers various ways of defending themselves, including recourse to an independent body.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also introduced a woman's right to return to her own job or an equivalent job under terms and conditions which are not less favourable to her after maternity leave. We are again tabling an amendment to protect fathers who apply for parental leave as well. They are still few in number. Europe-wide, just 2% of fathers claim this right, and these progressive fathers must not be excluded from our efforts. I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House. In my view, this too is an essential building block for the gender mainstreaming process. We Social Democrats want to break open old and entrenched structures and ensure that role stereotypes are no longer perpetuated.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive imposes an obligation on Member States to take action against discrimination. It is thus a move away from voluntary, non-binding provisions. I think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in Germany. The text also calls for the extension of the Equal Treatment Directive to the private sector. After the cases which we have witnessed, I hope that together, we can now finally make progress for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key issues is the new regulations on discrimination against women, namely the right to return to work after parental leave. According to the proposal, an employee or public sector worker is entitled to have their old job back after parental leave, or an equivalent job on terms which are at least as good.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, any conduct which treats a woman unfairly and which is linked directly or indirectly to pregnancy, motherhood or reconciling family and working life should be forbidden and should constitute direct discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I have an example from the municipality of Oravais, where I spend the summer. Here, a permanent employee was forced to resign so that the employment of the person standing in for them could be terminated. Is this not forbidden, as it is a case of direct discrimination and also a breach of the provision concerning the right to return to work? The conduct of this municipality is certainly a breach of the future provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The example shows the need for the new directives. It is important that we have regulations which prevent conduct that discriminates against young women in leading positions in the private or public sectors. I believe this is one of the key issues, particularly considering how many young women are currently employed in temporary posts. The legislation would provide protection for them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point which I hope we can consider further, namely the issue of organisations whose members belong to a particular profession. Where this issue is concerned, I believe we must look at the link between the two fundamental rights which we find in the legislation of many countries, namely freedom of association and the right to protection against discrimination, that is to say the right to equal opportunities. I am thinking, for example, of associations of female lawyers, which are close to my heart and which we must ensure we can maintain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To answer the question from the honourable Member of the TDI Group, however, it really is a shame that he can imagine that equality between the sexes should not be subject to legislation. How can we achieve equality without laws? I have never known that to happen throughout the entire history of the human race. I do not see why women should be outside the scope of legislation on equality. Laws are therefore necessary, and I should like to thank Mrs Hautala most warmly for the work that she has done, by herself and with us, consistently over several weeks, if not months. I have to say that this work has produced some important results. Why are they important? Because in the history of Europe this directive is the most well-known of all the directives on equality between the sexes. It is the most well-known in all our Member States. It is therefore extremely important, and I believe that its revision is equally important.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I should have liked to vote in favour of the Amendment No 42 proposed by Mrs Hautala, asking the Commission to make plans for an overall legislative system on the subject of women. It is time that the various directives were combined, and restructured together. Besides, there has been a lot of talk about the Treaty of Amsterdam, but one could also mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 23 of which stipulates equality between the sexes in all areas, which is a major advance on equality in professional and economic spheres alone.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to come back to the subject, as far as this overall approach is concerned, I was anxious that it should include a reference to equal pay, as in the 1975 Directive, and I am pleased to see that it does in fact do so, because it seems to me to be extremely important in the context of equal treatment. Why is this directive so important? It is also important for those countries which are candidates for EU enlargement. We know that working conditions for women in some of the candidate countries have, if anything, become worse since the Berlin Wall came down. I should like, if possible, to see the revision that we are currently undertaking serve as the basis for discussions with candidate countries from the point of view of enlargement. However, we can also spread the word in our own Member States as well. In France we have just adopted a law on equality at work which falls well short of what we are proposing here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our Member States will also be equal to the task that we are proposing here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It enhances the protection for employees who file complaints about discrimination. For the first time, it defines sexual harassment in the workplace as discrimination on grounds of sex, and it recognises the special protection granted to women due to their biological condition. One thing is clear, and with all our good intentions we must take this into account: all the rights conferred by the directive must be open to scrutiny by the courts, and therefore the employer can also only be held to account if he was informed, for example, about incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be scope to include the existing agencies, such as equal opportunities officers or works councils, in the delivery of equal opportunities. They must be able to act within the terms of the amended directive so that there is no need to set up new bodies at substantial staffing and financial cost. Monitoring and building on the results achieved is important, but here too, effective record-keeping can be expanded at national level in line with the directive so that the Commission is able to draw up European statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for annual equal opportunities reports would impose a disproportionately heavy financial burden on small and medium-sized undertakings. Women who bear children enjoy special protection in law. In this respect, a great deal has been achieved in the Member States of the European Union over the years. The European directive on maternity protection contains clear provisions here.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not oppose the inclusion of fathers, quite the contrary. However, I do oppose the sloppiness of the approach here, and the fact that maternity rights and paternity rights are treated as identical. There is one minor difference. Children are born to mothers, not fathers. By the very nature of things, we must therefore be able to differentiate. In this respect, the proposal is not very well thought out. We want equal treatment; we want equal opportunities in society, work and employment. Those are our stated goals. However, we must be very careful to achieve a balance so that women's jobs remain attractive now and in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are dealing with the necessary revision of this directive. It has turned out, as others have already said, to be a complicated operation, of which the end is not yet in sight, and not everything that has crossed the table is a model of elegant legislation in this respect, but I am hopeful of a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the following three principles should guide us in future and consequently I have three questions to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: the legislation on sexual equality, at present scattered over eight directives, should demonstrate legal clarity and coherence and be easier for citizens to understand. It is doubtful whether the present revision operation will be able to contribute to this aim. For this reason I should like to ask the Commissioner what she thinks about a codification of existing European legislation on equal treatment of men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: European legislation on equal treatment should offer an equal level of protection, with as far as possible identical definitions of the concept of discrimination, exceptional provisions, sanctions, etc. Not only for the sake of the principle of equality itself, but mainly with a view to forming a coherent body of law. Deviations from this principle should be based on the nature of the case itself, for example in relation to pregnancy, or the provisions of the Treaty, as in the case of positive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the complicated process of legislation this principle is sometimes under pressure, but I assume that the Commissioner shares this view. I should therefore like to know from her what she can and is prepared to do about this. Could she, for example, ask her network of legal experts for a comparative study of the legislation as regards the various grounds of discrimination?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question to the Commissioner relates to the area in which the equal-treatment legislation will be applied. This also cries out for further equality. When can we expect to see legislation already announced several times by the Commissioner, on equal treatment for men and women outside the labour market, and when will she put forward legislative proposals for the various grounds of discrimination? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you then hear certain speakers here, it is obvious that the debate is still all too necessary. It may well be that there is no-one who wants to speak out against the word equality, but in truth there are many people who are against the introduction of equality in practice, which is, after all, what we are attempting to do with this legislation. I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for the considerable work that she has put into this legislation, since this is, in fact, an example of how necessary it is to have legislation we can support, if we are to implement equality in practice. This is, after all, what all the judgements have shown. I think it is great that Mrs Hautala has been able to draw up a progressive report whilst at the same time succeeding in achieving a broad majority for it. That is necessary because, after all, 314 people have to vote in favour in order for the report to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, equality is one of the areas in which the EU still leads the field. That is something that we women should perhaps point out somewhat more in the public debate when we are discussing the EU in other contexts, and at any rate in contexts in which we face very strong opponents who believe that the EU does nothing whatsoever for its citizens. This is, of course, an outstanding example of the EU actually doing something for its citizens and being way ahead of the field, even compared with the Scandinavian countries. We can really describe it as a case of a very positive synergy effect between the Member States and the Commission. The proposal deals, of course, with various matters, including sexual harassment and matters related to childbirth, but also with opportunities for fathers. I think it is very good that we have managed to bring fathers more into focus, for if we are really to have equality then it is crucial for men also to become involved to a greater extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market. Women still earn less than men. Women are under-represented in senior management. Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hautala's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities. However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women's working lives into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed reform does not go far enough. For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women. Women must have equal pay for work of equal value! We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks. I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society. I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the Commission on its initiative in adapting the legislation in this area to these developments at European level and also in giving new impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive must be seen in combination with the recommendation on child care, the directive on parental leave and the directive that lays down minimum conditions for the improvement of the safety and health of pregnant women at work, and with the directive that we discussed last year on the basis of Article 13 and on which we approved a report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in many countries and situations women are still disadvantaged and discriminated against. The combination of work and care still presents problems in many cases, not only for women but also for men wishing to combine work and care. As yet few men, by the way, take parental leave: according to the most recent data in Denmark, for example, the figure is seven men to one hundred women, in France one to one hundred, and in Germany two to a hundred.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the amendments focusing on these measures to protect pregnancy and motherhood to be supplemented with measures relating to fatherhood. Mrs Van der Laan, my sentiments are shared by many other women in the Christian-Democrat group.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem, Mr President, is sexual harassment. This occurs more frequently than we would like in work situations. The report makes proposals on combating and preventing such intimidation. Last year I was draftsperson of my committee’s opinion on the directive on Article 13. This has close points of contact with the directive at present before us. I pointed out at that time the important role of confidants. That need not be a person specially assigned for the purpose – anyway, that is infeasible in smaller organisations – but someone in the organisation who enjoys wide trust and acts as a someone to whom staff can talk.</p>
<p class="contents">I also argued for an independent body to deal with complaints. I support the amendments that would facilitate this. The report also has an inescapable impact for employers, for example report writing and returning to the same job. I believe that we can provide a good impetus and at the same time make acceptable demands on employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various surveys have shown that many hundreds of thousands of employees, predominantly women, encounter this, with all the adverse consequences for their health and their career. I should like to remind honourable Members that for that reason three years ago the ETUC was already advocating collective negotiations in order to tackle this problem, but sadly the employers’ organisation persistently refused. It is therefore necessary and useful that legislators should now act.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore glad, Commissioner, that in the proposal sexual harassment is seen as a form of discrimination based on sex. I believe that the sanctioning approach of the European Commission is good, but perhaps insufficient. For that reason the European Parliament would be well advised to provide an efficient prevention policy, as was provided for at the time in the code of conduct accompanying the recommendation of 1991 on the protection of the dignity of men and women at work.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that employers too should take responsibility for ensuring that no sexual harassment occurs in the work environment. In Belgium Minister Onkelinx recently presented a bill, under which each company must draw up a prevention plan and appoint a prevention consultant. I consider that a good approach that can be safely followed in Europe. Accordingly I hope that this directive, in its present form, with the amendments made by our committee, can be approved under the Belgian presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has a long tradition of fighting for equal rights for men and women. The position of women particularly was very important: equal pay for equal work, equal treatment by social security, independent rights in pensions and social security and a number of regulations relating to the combination of work and care.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s legislation sets a new milestone. The proposal gives a new content to the principal of discrimination, which issues from the Treaty of Amsterdam, but certainly also from the judgements of the Court of Justice, which has always been a fighter for women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time at European level the concept of sexual harassment has been given a clear content. Sexual harassment is a violation of the principle of equality between men and women and also violates the dignity of men and women. It is better to tackle this problem now.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content given to the principle of discrimination I am grateful to the rapporteur that my amendment, which was intended to broaden the concept by including alongside the workplace admission to work and to a profession, as well as the training and education which lead to a position, was immediately accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my annoyance at the fuss just made by Mrs Van der Laan. She devoted a part of her allotted speaking time to saying: It was my idea. I, Mrs Van der Laan, came up with the idea that men too and parenthood must be discussed. Mrs Van der Laan, if you had paid better attention, you would have known that that idea would at any rate have obtained a majority in our group. So I think that in that respect voting behaviour will show that there is no great opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, discrimination is often connected with gender. The only problem I still have concerns the concept of foster-parenthood, for which there is there is no legal basis. I wonder if we should not provide one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Insofar as equality between men and women is an objective and also a mission for the European Union, we need to adapt, update and also think up new strategies, new legislative texts that will enable us to complete this task effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The article on sexual harassment should be highlighted, and I will not expand on this point as it has already been sufficiently highlighted. It is also important, in my opinion, to define direct and indirect discrimination, and to establish positive action as a tool for balancing out inequalities, a transitory tool until equality is achieved. From the start, the European Community has aimed to eradicate unequal treatment, but unfortunately today there are still blatant inequalities in this area on which I will not expand either.</p>
<p class="contents">An international organisation has said that, at the pace things are moving, we could achieve equality in four or five centuries, and I do not think that any of us here are prepared to wait such a long time. We need to intervene with positive measures such as this in order to change an order that is profoundly unfair and that is contrary to the development of our societies.</p>

I agree with what many honourable Members have said and so will limit myself to a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at my own country – since I believe everyone is exploring what the impact will be on their own country – I see three crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the annual report on the equal treatment of men and women that is required from companies in this directive. I introduced that in my own country. It is encountering huge resistance and has never been complied with, although it is compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, positive action. That also remains a very difficult matter, even with women.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, equal pay. Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am actually trying to say with these three examples is that if we want to succeed in implementation in the area of this directive, which I think is a good one, we may perhaps have to talk more with the social partners than we have done in the past. Only if they support things on the ground and cooperate in trying to carry them out, will anything change at grass-roots level. Take the example of equal pay. At a time of recession, the response is: ‘We can’t have completely equal pay, that’s too expensive’. But it does not happen in boom times either. I believe that more pressure should be applied on them, particularly since we all accept they are primarily responsible for the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to say something briefly about sexual harassment. Some fifteen years ago, I launched a campaign in Belgium under the title “Sex colleague, ex-colleague”. Since then legislation has been devised, confidants have been assigned, a network of confidants has been set up, and those confidants have been trained. I must say that it actually works quite well and is also supported by the social partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, Mrs Hautala, Commissioner, I am very pleased to see that so many members have referred to the amendments relating to the position of parents – particularly young parents. Motherhood, pregnancy and fatherhood must not prevent progress in working life. I find Amendment No 25 to be particularly welcome and well-justified. Reference has already been made here to the fact that childbearing tends to be postponed in periods of economic prosperity, and this is particularly worrying as far as young women are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that Amendment No 42 is good, i.e. referring to this problem of equal pay, which in my opinion is still the worst problem in Europe in terms of gender equality. It is completely intolerable that even today in many sectors, even in the public sector, the average earnings of women are lower than those of men with equivalent education and experience. Our society and our economy cannot afford not to exploit to the full the skills of its entire population. Our society must offer all its members equal and unlimited opportunities for self-development along their chosen path. Old-fashioned and artificial structures must not be allowed to impede an individual’s professional, educational or career development or personal growth, irrespective of their gender.</p>
<p class="contents">Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon. I would like to emphasis that the natural human dignity and integrity of the individual are inviolable basic values, particularly to us conservatives. Sexual harassment, this subject on which silence has reigned for so long, must be efficiently tackled. However, there is cause to take action at European Union level only where we are unable to create sufficient legislation at national level. On this issue I am of the opinion that healthy social structures and efficient national legislation are the best means of preventing sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union legislation must also comply with the general legal requirements for legislation. A text worded clearly, accurately and in detail is one of these. When bringing their own case in court people must be able to base their demands on a clear legal text. In this respect I support Ms Lulling’s opinion that this report is not sufficiently legally precise throughout. Furthermore, I would like to say that I absolutely oppose Amendment No 40, which refers to collective action being adopted in this sector. While I am not of the opinion that this would be a bad thing in this sector in particular, I do object in general to the collective action mechanism being brought into the European legal system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala and all the members of the committee involved in this very complicated operation.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the European Union has proposed a combination of political tools to add value in line with the policy of equal opportunities, such as its legislation, the Fifth Programme, employment strategy, the guidelines, the mainstreaming policies, the social funds, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation is one of the most important and effective political tools and there is no need to continually propose new legislation. We must modernise the existing legislation and adapt and adjust it to a world of change. This is what we have attempted to do, taking into account new models of production, the family and society. We have taken into account the new treaty and the new legal basis and, of course, we have taken into account the case law of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly answer some of the questions put. First, on codification: Yes, we are going to present our work on codification of legislation on the same legal basis. Second, there is an expert group which meets three times per year and they examine the problems of compatibility between European and national legislation. Thirdly, I was asked whether we are going to continue with new directives going beyond the employment field. We are committed to doing that and proposals will be made next year. As far as sexual harassment is concerned, we have accepted as many of the proposals as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There was excellent cooperation between the committee and the Commission and I really believe that agreement can be reached on this proposal at the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 11 June. It is very important to reach this agreement at this Council so that we can move to final adoption during the Belgian presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obliged to refer to each amendment and to explain why they are rejected or accepted, so allow me to read out exactly what the Commission's position is. It is very important to say that the Commission can accept 49 of the 69 amendments, although we would prefer a different wording for 17 of them and can only accept 17 of these amendments in part.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Amendments Nos 7 and 21, which provide for definitions of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment in one article. The Commission can also accept, in principle, part of Amendments Nos 39 and 68, which extend the powers of independent bodies to cover all directives in the area of equality of treatment between women and men. However, the Commission cannot accept the part of Amendment No 39, which provides for funding and human resources for these bodies. Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept that these bodies could examine and pursue complaints for individuals and organisations without the consent of these individuals or groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 15 and 40 in part would allow law organisations and associations to take cases on behalf of a complainant. The Commission can only accept this in cases of approval or consent of the complainant. The spirit of Amendment No 10 and part of Amendments Nos 25, 46 and 69 stress the importance of the reconciliation of family and working life and call for complementary action on paternity leave. We can accept Amendments Nos 12 and 38 on the protection of victims of discrimination, including employees and trade union delegates against any adverse treatment. Amendment No 33 clarifies that the application of the principle of equal treatment concerning membership of, and involvement in, an organisation should not ban organisations of a single sex. The Commission never intended such a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept: Amendments Nos 14 and 42 urging Member States to encourage employers to establish annual equality plans in order to promote equal treatment; Amendment No 41, encouragement of dialogue with non-governmental organisations having an interest in promoting equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept part of Amendments Nos 11, 27 nor Amendment No 55 insofar as they introduce a definition of positive action into the text of the directive itself. This definition of positive action is already contained in the text of treaty and therefore should not be part of the directive. However, the Commission could agree to a reference to Declaration 28 of the Treaty, which provides for priority for women in positive action measures in the recitals and in the text of the directive. The Commission can accept part of the rest of Amendments Nos 11 and 27, the establishment of reports on positive action every two years but not annual reports and not linked to the employment process. This would be unrealistic and over-complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 1 and parts of various other amendments, which replace "equal treatment between women and men" with "equality for women and men". This would be incompatible with the wording of the Treaty. This is the major issue; it is not a question of political differences or an ideological problem. We must use the wording of the Treaty and the wording of the Treaty is "equality of treatment for men and women". The Commission can accept the latter wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments that the Commission rejects are part of Amendments No 9 and 59 as a matter of principle since they refer to the need to amend another Community directive on equal treatment relating to maternity. A directive cannot provide for future modification of another directive which concerns health and safety at the workplace. Nor can it accept Amendment No 4, which refers to the necessity for the Commission to make proposals on the basis of Article 13 to cover areas beyond employment, occupational and vocational training. Such a provision cannot be contained in a directive, which does not go beyond these fields. But as I have already said, we are going to propose measures in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 36 and 61 which extend judicial protection to all cases where discrimination takes place after termination of the employment relationship. This goes beyond the scope of the directive. Amendment No 44 which provides for contractual compliance with respect to equal treatment, particularly in the public procurement context, goes beyond the scope of the directive, but we have discussed it with the committee in the past and I have explained to you that there is cooperation between me and Mr Bolkestein. We are going to issue a communication and support and encourage Member States to take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you can see, the Commission can accept most of Parliament's amendments. I would highlight our acceptance of Amendments Nos 7 and 21, definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment and Amendment No 39 in part, scope of powers of independent bodies. I accept in spirit Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 51 and 60 and partially Amendments Nos 5 and 9, first part in spirit, Amendment No 11, first part, Amendment Nos 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 30, 39, 40, 43 (second part), 46 (second part), 50 (second part) and 69 (second part). Many amendments could be accepted in full such as Amendments Nos 13, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 41, 42, 45, 47, 60, 66 and 68. However, I reject Amendments Nos 1, 4, 36, 43 (first part) and Amendments Nos 44, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and 67.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the first time that the Women's Committee had participated in the codecision procedure. It was a first experience and a very successful one, because such complicated work has had excellent results. I would like to congratulate you. I would like to thank you for your cooperation so that we can have this directive in place as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
