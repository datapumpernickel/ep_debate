<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mrs Plassnik, Commissioners, I believe – partly for the reasons that we have previously discussed – that the transatlantic relationship is extraordinarily important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an issue concerned with the operation of NATO which, now as previously, is indispensable to Europe’s collective security. In the big issues concerning business and trade, there are conflicts but also agreements. This transatlantic community is also a community of values in spite of all the discussions we have regarding individual matters. That being said, matters are coming slightly unstuck.</p>
<p class="contents">I found it remarkable that, a fortnight ago, when, at my request, the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lawrow, visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he proposed that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia be extended next year and deeper institutional links be established between the Russian and EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has agreements with just about everyone in the world, just as the United States of America does. Only, there are no agreements between the United States and the European Union. This will have consequences at some point. When I consider the preparations for the summit in terms of this absence of agreements – preparations helped along by the sterling efforts of the Council and the Commission – I can see there again being discussions about many individual matters, on which there may or may not be agreement, but there being, however, no bigger picture or framework for the discussions to take place in: a framework, moreover, in which we might also be able to include the American Congress, for anyone familiar with American policy in the fields of trade, economics and foreign policy knows that speaking with the administration is only half the battle.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we should find contractual solutions that will enable us to convert the Transatlantic Declaration into a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement. Such an agreement would provide a framework – and our fellow Member, Mrs Mann, will later present this in much more detail in terms of economic policy – that will make it possible, even in the case of tensions and conflicts of interest, to reach agreements more quickly. For the reasons I have just mentioned, I consider this to be incredibly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, as the public are also aware, NATO can no longer cope with everything on its own. The aim is that, by 2015, it should be possible for a transatlantic market to arise that can also deal with all associated problems to do with social policy and with the need to secure the multilateral dimension. Let me not be misunderstood: a bilateral relationship should not destroy the multilateral approach of, for example, the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">What this arrangement could, however, do is draw us into a ‘community of actions’ to promote global and regional cooperation on the basis of common values. Underlying the arrangement would be a common basis of values and our joint interest in the arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iran issue is the kind of issue I have in mind: one in relation to which we can only achieve something if we act together in order peacefully to prevent people from producing atomic bombs. We must also arrive at peaceful solutions in the Near and Middle East, where there is a cluster of common interests and values. This is something we can do only within the framework of this dialogue, which goes above and beyond the NATO dialogue. The currently still very sluggish Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue could be converted into a Transatlantic Assembly. These things may at present be pipe-dreams and fantasies, but I consider it necessary to proceed in this way in order to turn them into a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to bring such an arrangement into operation, the European Parliament should, as a first step, set up an early warning system in Washington, with a reciprocal arrangement also put in place, in order in this way to have our sights set on legislation at an early stage. The European Parliament’s rapporteurs should be able to speak with their opposite numbers in the American Congress in order to make progress with these matters. In that way, consensus might be achieved at the preparatory phase, and there would subsequently be no anger of the kind now given rise to by, for example, court judgments on past actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should bring our critical stance to bear. On many issues, including the International Court of Justice, climate change and Iraq, the United States has adopted attitudes for which we need to criticise the present US Government. Such criticism – directed towards a particular administration in individual cases and concerning specific matters – should not, however, cause the transatlantic gulf to become wider. For this reason, the Council, the Commission and the US administration should at last find the strength to go beyond the catch-as-catch-can approach and provide a broader and deeper basis for this alliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As so often, I have the great pleasure of preparing the accompanying report on behalf of the Committee on International Trade and, in this, I am concentrating more on foreign trade and economic themes.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the past, I also share the views of my fellow Member, Mr Brok. Like many of our fellow Members, we have worked together for many years, and we have also always received the considerable support of this House, for which I should expressly like to thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at business and trade relations, then my report essentially contains one key idea. The Commission does, of course, share the view that we should proceed on the basis of how things really are. We already have a transatlantic market. It exists. It is just that we are often scarcely aware of it. We always talk about all the things we have to do, and we always focus completely on the trade barriers that exist. It is these trade barriers too with which the press concerns itself on a daily basis, but what frequently we no longer see at all are the positive things we have achieved. What this report says, therefore, is: let us for once just be aware of the way things really are. How much trade really goes on between the European Union and the United States? What investments take place? Another thing: what is the volume of trade done by enterprises established in both Europe and the United States? As can be seen, the figure is huge. I do not want to bore you now with it, but it is astronomical.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of jobs that depend on such trade is really extremely high. The figure for those that we know about on each side of the Atlantic – and there are very many more, because there is a lot of data we have not obtained – in itself amounts to EUR 7 million. Here is an example that I come up with again and again: that of our famous flagship, Airbus, on the European side and of Boeing on the American side. We are always so proud, with Europeans and Americans each believing the one to be a purely European business and the other a purely American one. Yet that is not the case. The two companies are 40% dependent on each other. This provides you with a good example. Go to MTU. I have had the great pleasure of looking at the operation in my own constituency. When, for example, repairs are being carried out – with the work benches, as it were, running parallel – you can see Airbus and Boeing planes each in their turn, now one and now the other. That is only one example, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Building on an awareness of how things really are and proceeding on the basis of the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 and of the economic agenda that we have had since 1998, which has been upheld at all the summits, in all the decisions of the European Parliament and in the Commission’s work programme and which was upheld and confirmed in the legislative dialogue that took place a couple of weeks ago in Vienna between our fellow Members and the Americans, we should therefore take a further step – not an earth-shattering step, but just a small one – and say: let us at long last remove the barriers that are causing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, as many people outside believe, about removing barriers to create a free-trade zone – ATTAC has been stirring things up a bit in this case – but about removing technical barriers, as we have been doing for many years. In that way, we stick to our standards and to our precautionary principle, and we continue to maintain the rules of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s and the Member States’ sovereignty is not encroached upon. Nor is this a naïve proposal because we know that there will, of course, be further trade disputes. That is only natural and to be expected. What we have here are the two largest trade blocks. Obviously, there is a clash of interests. That is also the way it should be. The fact is, we have disputes in the EU too, but they do not send us into a panic every time they happen. Disputes are normal. Some of them we can solve within the framework of the world trade round. Many of them we cannot solve. The Hamon dispute is one that we have not been able to solve for many years, and we are paying for the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also problems on the American side. For example, the Americans have difficulty recognising non-pasteurised milk, which they see as a health problem. So what about their precautionary principle? All right, that is just the way things are. Let us live with the situation. There are, however, many other barriers that we should remove. In this report, I am asking that we do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a point about which I still need, in a moment, to say something. I should expressly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee, all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission which, as always, has worked excellently with me and all my colleagues, and, also of course, the Council, the NGOs, the think tanks, the trade unions, the companies and those otherwise involved, as well as my own group. Some parts of my own group – I am referring to the group of the Greens – have some problems with the term ‘barrier-free’, because it always sounds as if it refers to a free-trade area. Hence, my proposal for tomorrow concerning split voting. I would propose that we simply remove such concepts and the figures referred to in connection with them. I hope that I shall obtain the House’s support in this connection. We can then all breathe a sigh of relief, and we shall have a sound basis on which to proceed. I hope that we shall then also obtain the House’s full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I know that you are nervous. Nonetheless, just two more points I have to mention. In the case of bioethanol, I should like to introduce a verbal addition. I forgot to include bioethanol and biodiesel. Therefore, I shall say tomorrow: and diesel. On this subject, too, I hope that I shall obtain your support. And that, in theory, is everything. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ursula Plassnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union probably has no other partner in the world with which it has such close and intensive relations as the United States of America. It goes without saying, then, that it is a matter of central importance for every Presidency that a strong and well-functioning network of relations should be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In retrospect, 2005 saw the relationship characterised, on the whole, by positive developments. We have achieved considerable progress on a number of issues, and we are – as is often the case prior to policies are determined – engaging in dialogue in order to reach a convergence of opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consider for instance the area of promotion of democracy, where we can take positive credit for our close cooperation during the presidential elections in Belarus. In the run-up to the elections we declared ourselves, over and over again, in favour of a free and fair electoral process. We called for the protection of the opposition and adopted parallel strategies in support of democratic forces. After the elections, which were neither free nor fair, we also agreed to impose travel restrictions and targeted financial sanctions on government members and other leading individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of promotion of democracy, much the same holds true for Ukraine, where we are working together closely with the USA to consolidate democratic and market-economy structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example of a very close and successful ongoing cooperation is the Western Balkans. In this case we are agreed on the necessary European or rather European-Atlantic perspective for the states of the Western Balkans. We are, in the Contact Group, working towards a common position for the final status talks on Kosovo. We affirm our commitment to a continuing international presence, and we are convinced that close cooperation on the basis of equal rights between the EU and NATO in the area of security policy is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">A further example is the Middle East Peace Process, where we are continually working very closely together to coordinate our position within the framework of the Quartet and on the basis of the Road Map – now a topic of particular significance, given the elections and new governments in Israel and among the Palestinians as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you will allow me here to make a short comment on Iran. Tomorrow a meeting of foreign ministers takes place in Vienna, in which the EU three, Javier Solana, China, Russia and the USA will be taking part. The intention is that, at this meeting, an offer to Iran should be finalised, one that should make it possible for Iran to use atomic energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. At the same time there must be absolute certainty that Iran is using or rather developing nuclear energy for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we heard with interest that my American counterpart Condoleezza Rice has spoken of the possibility, and I quote, ‘of newer and more positive relations between the USA and Iran’. We regard this as an important signal and hope that active American participation will bring us success in building a new cooperative relationship with Iran. This is where direct dialogue between Washington and Tehran is certainly of central significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability and security, peace and prosperity are also the highest common goals of transatlantic cooperation with regard to Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the area of justice and internal affairs, it has been possible, during the Austrian Presidency, to involve the USA in the implementation of foreign policy strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of important challenges raise overlapping political questions in their various aspects, and they still deserve particular attention, for instance international humanitarian law, anti-terrorism and cooperation in crisis management. It should not go unmentioned that there are topics on which we have clear differences of opinion, and in this broad dialogue it does not go without being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Guantánamo – about which we have just had a debate – is one of these issues. Nevertheless it is important in this context to mention that the dialogue of experts on international law, which was begun under our Presidency, serves the purpose of arriving together at positions which are in accordance with our common fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">Other controversial themes which we keep on putting on the agenda of formal summits between the EU and the USA are the Visa Waiver Programme and the International Criminal Court. We share the same opinion on many multilateral questions and we work hand in hand, but the International Criminal Court is one of the points about which there are differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We also take a critical view of the USA’s attempts to conclude agreements with third countries relating to Article 98 of the Rome Statute, since this runs counter to the International Criminal Court’s aim to have a universally valid jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me also mention a positive aspect in this context, that being the fact that the USA has permitted the prosecution of war crimes in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">One important component to which reference was made earlier is economic relations. Given the vast degree of economic interconnection and mutual interdependence, the successful further development of our economic relations must be a matter of priority. We are each others’ most important trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Two thirds of direct investment in the European Union comes from the USA, and reciprocal investments at present amount to EUR 1 500 billion. Mutual trade amounts to approximately EUR 1 billion per day. In view of our joint share of world production the European Union and the USA have a particular global responsibility, and so it is essential that we should cooperate closely in economic questions as well and strive together towards a progressive removal of trade barriers. I am sure that the Commission will go into this matter in even greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Spring Summit, we have achieved a great deal with the implementation of the jointly agreed working programme, for instance the first meeting of the Regulatory Cooperation Forum. This deals among other things with the reduction or rather the removal of trade barriers which arise because of different safety regulations for cars or other goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are working on a common strategy for the protection of intellectual property rights. We welcome Parliament’s suggestions and recommendations, as expressed in the reports of your Members Mr Brok and Mrs Mann. The reports show us very clearly how hard we are all working together in a united effort, and also that improving transatlantic relations is just as much a matter of great importance for you as it is for the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would also like to mention that a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue – an important component of our relations – recently took place in Vienna. Passing on to the specific question of the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, discussed in the report, it seems to us that the time is not yet ripe for this, and so the Presidency recommends, in the first instance, continuing to build upon existing practical cooperation. The New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 continues to be the currently-applicable framework for our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we have received clear signals from the USA that it takes a somewhat cautious view of the prospect of further formalisation of relations, we have chosen to concentrate on content and concrete results and are now striving towards a more effective use of existing structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The regular formal meetings of senior officials are well supplemented by a great many further contacts and agreements in all areas of common interest. They have made the political dialogue more strategic and at the same time more substantial. In many areas referred to in your House’s reports, we are already working closely together, and so there is a community of actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The next Summit in June 2006 in Vienna is currently being prepared by the Council and the Commission. Our goal for the Summit is to maintain the recent dynamic in transatlantic relations. We also want to create new initiatives for further cooperation leading up to the next Summit, whereby a matter of particular concern to us is to communicate better the intensity, importance and usefulness of the transatlantic partnership to the Europeans as well. We have therefore decided to concentrate on a Summit statement that will look towards the future and be as concise and substantial as possible, and to supplement this with progress reports for political and economic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we will also state our future priorities at the Summit. These are among others a reinforced cooperation in the global promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, a new dialogue about energy security, the conclusion of an agreement on air traffic and concentrating on the implementation of intellectual property rights in third countries. Europe and the USA are bound together inseparably, not only historically, but also by common values. It is only together that we can meet global challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Our many common economic and political interests as well as our security interests outweigh the differences which can and must exist between partners. We are ultimately indispensable partners for each other, partners who have to bear a global responsibility together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, let me start with my perception of EU-US relations from the external relations perspective. Commissioner Mandelson will then complete the picture on the economic and trade relations. I shall focus, therefore, more on Mr Brok’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">As this excellent report makes clear, the context of EU-US relations has changed enormously over the course of the last year. Following President Bush’s visit to Brussels and the 2005 summit, the tensions we experienced in 2003 and 2004 have been replaced by a new spirit of constructive engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">We came out of the 2005 summit with eight declarations on a wide range of issues which guided our collaboration. The declaration on democracy promotion shows how far our cooperation on foreign policy has come. Even if there are differences from time to time – as we have just seen and the President-in-Office of the Council has just mentioned – we are now taking the initiative and being more proactive in our approach, rather than fire-fighting.</p>
<p class="contents">Our activity to spread democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law – which Mr Brok highlights in his motion for a resolution – can only go so far. Without the full commitment of the country concerned, democracy cannot be sustained. Nevertheless, when that commitment is there, our coordinated action makes a difference, for instance – as has already been mentioned – in Ukraine, where we supported the reform process; in Belarus, where our common stance against the lack of reform sent a clear message to the regime; and in the Middle East peace process, where coordination is essential and where it works quite well.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have been very closely involved in coordinating our position with the United States. The motion for a resolution mentions the need to better coordinate assistance. I am particularly pleased that the Quartet took up the EU’s proposal for a temporary international mechanism to channel contributions to the basic health and social needs of the Palestinian people. We are working on that basis and I hope that we will be ready by the end of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">Before handing over to Mr Mandelson, let me mention four issues which are highlighted in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is energy. Both the EU and the US are faced with record high oil prices and increased dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels. According to current trends, the European Union will have to import 70% of its energy in 2030 compared to 50% today. The US is facing a similar problem. We therefore need to take a holistic approach in tackling this problem, including involving our major partners. At next month’s EU-US Summit, we intend to establish a strategic cooperation on energy, addressing the security of energy supply – including the diversification of supply routes, the enforcement of market rules, the protection of infrastructure, the promotion of alternative sources of energy, and, finally, energy sufficiency. The key is to increase predictability by creating the right market conditions and legal frameworks in both the producer and transit countries. This is the message we will bring to the EU-US Summit, but also to the G8 Summit and to other international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is visas. One of the Commission’s top priorities is to resolve the issue of the US’s non-reciprocal application of visa requirements. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will reach a solution soon, but we will continue to press for progress and will raise it again with President Bush at the summit. Last time, the issue was highlighted and we hoped that things would progress more quickly. In July 2006, we will issue a second report on visa reciprocity, which may examine the possibility of taking specific measures in response to any lack of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I wanted to tackle is China. As Mr Brok rightly points out in his resolution, we need to coordinate our approach to third countries, particularly China, effectively. We share the same approach: to help China move towards democracy and integrate fully into the world economy and the world market. Two years ago, we took steps to coordinate ourselves better by establishing the EU-US dialogue on East Asia. This has proved a very useful forum for discussing relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement. I know that Mr Brok’s committee feels very strongly about this, and I fully support the desire to see transatlantic relations go from strength to strength. As you know, I have always been open to exploring the pros and cons of a contractual relationship with the United States. It is indeed strange that we do not have more formal relations with our most important partner. As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, the question is whether a formal agreement would really bring much added value today to our relations. The most important thing is that the EU and the US work together for our common strategic cause. For this, we need political will, in particular, but also understanding towards each other. I feel that a treaty, for instance, would not have enabled us to bridge the differences which dogged our relations in 2003 and 2004, which were political in nature. At this moment there is no political appetite for such an agreement either in the US Administration or among Member States. However, this might change in the future. Should attitudes change or should it become clear that there is, after all, an institutional obstacle to closer cooperation, then the time might be right to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end with a remark about the important role Parliament plays in transatlantic relations. As you know, I have always been an enthusiastic supporter of interparliamentary exchanges. I am convinced that these relations benefit greatly from the links between the European Parliament and the US Congress. I very much encourage you to continue to build these ties. I thank you for what has already been done in the legislators’ dialogue and what might be done before the summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a dozen committees of this Parliament, and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it, shows how deep and intricate the EU-US economic relationship is.</p>
<p class="contents">That relationship effectively operates at two levels. On one level, steady leadership is required to promote a further convergence of our shared economic rules and regulatory frameworks – our companies, our jobs and our competitiveness demand this. At the other level, what happens in the rest of the world also depends on whether and how the EU and the US are able to react to events together.</p>
<p class="contents">No political relationship in our time is of greater importance to the global economy than the Transatlantic Partnership. The response to the rise of China and India, the pressures of globalisation, the current challenges in the energy field, the way multilateral institutions function, climate change: all these depend on the ability of Europe and the United States to cooperate effectively together.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere is this more apparent than in the continuing WTO negotiations. I am fortunate to have had a shared sense of purpose with my counterpart Rob Portman, and I look forward to continuing this with Susan Schwab, the new US Trade Representative – I hope she will be confirmed shortly by the Senate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that I think the European Union and the United States need to bring our positions in the Doha round closer together. The warning bell is ringing on the DDA. The danger lights are flashing, because if the gaps are not closed in the coming weeks, we will face serious institutional, legislative and political obstacles to ending this round.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States will shortly swing into election mode, trade authority is set to lapse, there are electoral constraints in other parts of the world too – a coming election in Brazil, for example. The window on the Doha round is closing rapidly. Europe is ready to negotiate further; we have indicated our flexibility, and no sector is out of bounds to us. We look to our partners to express the same sense of purpose and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words now on Erika Mann’s report itself. I am glad that it shows strong support for the work programmes adopted last November to implement the EU-US economic initiative. In the progress report which we will present to the next summit on 21 June, we will be able to list some good achievements. The EU-US action strategy for intellectual property rights enforcement in third countries will be endorsed. It will contain a number of concrete cooperation measures, especially between our customs services and embassies in selected third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the high-level regulatory cooperation forum, too, I am satisfied that after two meetings in Brussels and Washington within a very short timeframe, we have now clearly established the forum as the place for EU and US regulators to exchange best practice. We hope very much that the benefits of increased cooperation will soon be felt by companies on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">The signature of the long-awaited air services agreement, as well as the agreement on civil aviation safety, is now expected during the second half of the year. On the air services agreement, we will have to keep pushing the US Government to go ahead with the rule-making changes and resist protectionist pressure from Congress. Your help in this House will be most valuable to us in pursuing this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your continued interest in a more visionary and strategic approach – I happen to think that there is a place for vision in politics. I note your call for the 2006 EU-US Summit to design a new transatlantic partnership agreement that leads to the achievement of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015. In my view, the EU-US economic initiative has shown that we are getting there, we are moving in that direction step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably the right approach is to advance steadily on issues of mutual interest and to show – for example in the areas of intellectual property rights and regulatory cooperation – concrete successes to our citizens. We have to earn our way in our acceptance of the approach that I know is supported in the report. I think this pragmatic approach will be assured of support because in reality there is no US enthusiasm – either in the Administration or in Congress – for any ‘bigger bang’ EU-US scheme. On issues like investment and public procurement, which you rightly identify as areas of enormous potential – and they do have very great potential indeed – the US has not so far shown any interest in tackling bilateral barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the investment side, the Dubai Ports fallout requires careful handling. We have now at least established a contact group to address both old and new problems, and have proposed to the US government to include an investment paragraph in the summit declaration regarding the importance of an open transatlantic investment climate. This should send a strong message to the US Congress, which is currently debating the Shelby bill on the tightening of the Exon-Florio Statute. Again, your continued help on this, along with that of the US Congress, would be much appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to point out that we have had a very good first half of the year clearing out some important EU-US trade disputes on Foreign Sales Corporations, on Byrd, on the telecoms sanctions – I hope we can keep up the momentum in other areas. I am looking at two other disputes particularly at the moment to see whether they are susceptible to early resolution. FSC and Byrd prove that the WTO dispute settlement system works and that the availability of WTO-compatible sanctions can be an efficient way of obtaining US implementation of WTO judgments. Given the good results of the WTO system, I do not see at this stage the need for the kind of formal bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanism which you propose in your report, but I do not want to reject the idea completely. Be assured that we will exhaust all our informal channels with the United States and try everything possible to avoid going down the expensive and time-consuming route to Geneva, whenever this is avoidable.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me say that the transatlantic relationship is one which is too often simply taken for granted. Especially at this time, what we need is renewed commitment in order to make it work better. I am grateful for your report, which has highlighted this need once again in a very timely way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report contains a goal that I would particularly like to emphasise, namely the goal of achieving a common transatlantic capital market by 2010, for this is a goal that, in turn, shows the way forward in other areas. We can today already see that the transatlantic economy is defined by, and functions as a result of, direct investments and the ongoing collaboration between industry and research that supports trade. It is the intensity of those investments and the quantity of acquisitions in both directions which form the basis for comprehensive trade across the Atlantic, but it is also important to achieve a high level of research and innovation. This must be the best way to face up to and contribute to globalisation and to help bring about a strong global economy, not just for ourselves but for the rest of the world too.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also takes up a number of other issues, such as the importance of making it easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to become listed on the various stock markets, of facilitating and opening the way for company investments of equal size in both directions, of ensuring that reinsurers have the same opportunities and of ensuring that we achieve a common transatlantic capital market in the true meaning of the phrase. If we can achieve this, we will also be in a position to achieve other goals for cooperation across the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as the Commissioner mentioned, in the field of energy we need cooperation on efficiency sufficiency and on sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to research – which is extremely important – our committee is now working with the Seventh Framework Programme. Equally important is the cooperation with the institutions in the US as well as with industry. Much can be done to facilitate more cooperation in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have discussed the setting-up of a body to improve discussions between industries. We would like to set up something analogous to the very successful Iran-US claims tribunal, which, in a simple and elegant way, resolves thousands of disputes. We would like something similar in the future.</p>

We are pleased, therefore, to note that the rapporteur has taken into account the entire opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘cultural key’ can actually contribute towards strengthening our relationship and promoting mutual understanding between Europeans and Americans. Consequently, the establishment of a dialogue devoted to culture and education should encourage regular exchange of good practice and experience in fields such as the fight against piracy, the mobility of cultural players, or, again, the development of cultural tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding education, this dialogue should focus on strengthening the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications but also on interchanges of researchers and of university teachers and students. We should mention, therefore, that the forthcoming renewal of the Cooperation programme between our two continents in the fields of higher education and vocational training will also be of great benefit. On the other hand, the specificity of the audiovisual sector entails transatlantic exchanges that respect Europe’s cultural and linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, and in conclusion, we regret, nonetheless, that the United States did not choose to follow the Union and vote in favour of the Unesco Convention.</p>

<p class="contents">The USA is in a class of its own as the most important trading partner we in Europe have, which is a fact we often forget. The focus in public debate is mostly on what few problems there are in our trade relations. There is talk of crisis and conflict between Europe and the USA. This can be the case occasionally in the political sphere, but from an economic perspective precisely the opposite is, in actual fact, the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I might even dare to whisper that the trade between us has undergone a revolution. Today, the flow of trade between us is a fantastical EUR 1 billion per day. The deepest form of cross-border economic integration is mutual direct foreign investments. These have increased sharply and now stand at EUR 1.5 trillion. These are more than mere figures. Even if we do not think about it, the result is new opportunities for us in our everyday lives. The market that we have has, for example, created nearly seven million jobs in Europe. It gives us more and more services and better products.</p>
<p class="contents">Transatlantic trade, moreover, forms a large part of the engine of the world economy. If our relationship shows signs of weakness, there are knock-on effects for the whole world. The trade between us is thus not an alternative to trade with poorer countries. On the contrary, it is, in fact, a precondition and something that makes us all, throughout the world, richer. We must not take it for granted. We must carry on our work and integrate our economies. I therefore hope that we, together with the USA, can realise the idea of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I received an e-mail from the left-wing antiglobalisation movement. They exhorted me and every other MEP to vote against this report. Their argument was that, if this report were voted through by a majority in Parliament, it would open the way for an accelerated process of increased free trade between the USA and Europe. I hope that they are right and, for exactly that reason, I and the Swedish Conservatives intend to vote, rather, in favour of the report and in favour of a transatlantic free trade area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is paramount, as far as we are concerned, is the fact that the United States and the European Union have many shared interests, not least in the economic area, and we cannot sufficiently stress the importance of those economic interests. Those also include the risks that these entail, considering the differences in financial policy of the EU countries and that of the United States. Certainly in that area, we must try to strengthen cooperation with them, and Mrs Mann’s report contains many initiatives to that effect which are, in my view, very valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, by the same token, no denying the fact that we see things differently in certain areas. That is something that is, in fact, very well demonstrated in Mr Brok’s report. We are both independent partners in the partnership. I also support the idea of creating a more contractual relationship and partnership, which opens up the possibility, in the event of problems, of being able to discuss those openly and honestly, not least at parliamentary level. My question is only whether the USA is prepared to recognise the European Union to such an extent that it is prepared to enter into such a contractual relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, in the coming years, try to develop fresh policy in a number of areas, including energy policy, given the energy problems we experience and where the US and the Europeans share a number of common interests. I am in favour of a deeper relationship and of our cooperation to be fleshed out at federal level.</p>

The most important thing is that the basis is sound, and despite all the differences of opinion and all the frustration felt by America’s friends about some of the present administration’s policies, the basis here is sound. As the President-in-Office of the Council says, economic exchange is strong; people-to-people contacts are working, and politically too, numerous networks of intensive contacts have emerged from different dialogue formats and ad-hoc cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the mutual cooperation could still be improved: the New Transatlantic Agenda was well-constructed, but it has not become a genuine foundation and must be revitalised. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore supports the proposal put forward by Mr Brok in his report for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement as well as Mrs Mann’s vision of a transatlantic market.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course an agreement will add value only if it is filled with life, which means that the American side, too – especially in Congress – must demonstrate a real commitment to it. Given the current and long-term challenges that we face, progress here is absolutely necessary. As great democracies, we cannot afford not to fulfil our joint potential, and that is why a Partnership Agreement could be a step in the right direction, so let us take it!

However, in her report Mrs Mann calls, in her own words, for ‘a barrier-free transatlantic market’, and that is a free trade zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade should not be an end in itself for the purpose of higher profit rates, but one of the instruments for ensuring that the population is supplied with goods and services, for creating jobs and promoting social development and prosperity. We should therefore first of all assess whether the potential partner complies with internationally agreed standards on the protection of social security, jobs, environment and human rights and whether or not the partner accepts the institutions created to safeguard these.</p>
<p class="contents">Three brief examples: Firstly, there are fundamentally different opinions about GMOs and hormone-treated meat. The citizens of the European Union do not want these things. In the USA however it is absolutely legal to trade in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while public services and comprehensive social security systems are basic parts of political culture in the European Union, this is viewed differently in the USA. I ask you: How, in such an integrated economic area, can these things, which are of such importance to, and in the interests of, the public and the European Union, be preserved?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, does it, or does it not, distort competition if the USA does not sign the Kyoto Protocol? Of course it does, for they can then produce more cheaply to the detriment of the environment. As for the decisions of the WTO arbitration court on such things as cotton export subsidies, the USA simply ignores them.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude: this House recently adopted the Agnoletto report, which clearly states that the European Union should include a clause on human rights in all treaties with third countries. The USA makes war in Iraq in contravention of international law; it does not recognise the International Criminal Court; it holds prisoners of war in inhuman conditions in prisons like the one in Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p class="contents">I should now like to make a few brief political comments. If we in Europe want to avoid playing the role of junior partner, we cannot afford to fall further and further behind on economic and military matters. I must say that I am surprised at the complaints regarding American unilateralism, since our defence spending is two thirds that of America’s. I am concerned that Europe has only 25% of the USA’s mobile defence potential, and that we have an outdated structure of NATO bases in Europe, which in addition may be scaled down in favour of vague European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will not be a global player if we lose our capability to create a strategic political partnership with the USA. We cannot replace the USA for some other, better partner in this partnership. There is only one alternative open to a Europe with a declining economy, ailing public finances and tragic demographic figures. That alternative is marginalisation and isolation on the edges of a world that is forging ahead, sometimes recklessly, and sometimes even with hostility to ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this Chamber we often hear strong words of criticism and condemnation of the USA and, much more rarely, appeals to refrain from making any judgments of our largest ally. We should reject both extremes. Europe needs the United States, and the United States needs Europe. I say this against a background of rapid growth in the role of Asia, as well as an increase in the demographic and political role of Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Obsessive anti-Americanism is a disaster, but it is equally disastrous to be deprived of the right to ask our friends questions, for example to do with Guantanamo Bay. We must also patiently explain to Washington that if we are retreating, albeit slowly, from interventionism and protectionism in trade, America should do the same for the sake of balance.</p>
<p class="contents">EU-US relations should in the near future take the form of a real partnership and a strategic alliance, but this will only happen if we do not succumb to the stereotype of ‘Europe the teacher’ on the one hand, and ‘Europe the American client’ on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As shown by the relevant statistics, which I will not comment on due to lack of time, EU-US economic relations are characterised by symmetry and acute interdependence. Any crises which arise from time to time are, in my opinion, factors of the – so far – unresolved question of the management of this interdependence. This interdependence does not relate only to the past; it also relates to the new global economic and social challenges, including the so-called Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting these global challenges depends on moving bilateral relations from the current level of pronouncements to a cohesive, transparent and stable institutional framework and a more harmonised bilateral regulatory environment. A transatlantic market without barriers is a feasible objective; it just needs to be based on a new and unified regulatory architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement and intensification of the areas of close cooperation between the European Union and the USA are expected to have a positive spillover effect on all the problems which constitute the challenges of the contemporary global agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I would refer, among other things, to the promotion of common principles and values, such as democracy, the rule of law, defence of fundamental rights and freedoms, taking a broader view of the global trade order, effective international environmental protection, combating terrorism and organised crime and establishing a new financial architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, breaking the cohesion in EU-US relations will exacerbate international uncertainty and will have adverse repercussions on global cooperation, peace, stability and security, both political and economic.</p>
<p class="contents">The completion of negotiations at the Doha Round constitutes, as Commissioner Mandelson has also said, a test ground for this close relationship between the European Union and the USA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to stress the role of political dialogue between the European Parliament and the US Congress. Every EU-US summit should be preceded by a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, dealing with political, economic, cultural and social issues. The aim should be for the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue to become one of the most important platforms for EU foreign policy-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA’s hegemonistic role at the start of the 21st century requires the EU to display autonomy and true partnership in transatlantic relations, as well as to ask questions openly and to search for a common political platform. The most pressing issues are still the need to convince the USA to take part in reforming the UN and to respect human rights and civil liberties in the fight against terror. These issues must be discussed at the next EU-US summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the issue of visas. The European Union should not tolerate a situation in which the citizens of some Member States require a visa to stay in the USA. The relevant EU institutions should pose the question of lifting visa restrictions for the USA for all citizens of the European Union in their contacts with the US authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good time to underline how strong this relationship is and to what extent it goes far beyond the current administration and the problems with the specific administration and specific leadership, which some of us will not like. It is something that is deeper than that and it goes far beyond that. It goes beyond the strong political debate we might have. Precisely because the relationship is strong, it allows us to tell the truth to the other party.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the relationship lacks a real new structure, a real new architecture. As is mentioned in the reports, we need a new architecture to protect this relationship, to protect it from external storms and to make it much more solid than it is now. This needs commitment from the Commission. We are not seeing this commitment in looking for this new architecture, and I think it is the Commission’s role to develop and to work towards that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do still have some concerns about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is at least a question mark over whether now is the right time, politically, to be advancing a policy of what is essentially a bilateral free trade area. We are in a time when the multilateral system is in crisis. We have therefore to consider what political message we are sending by doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, my concern is that by pursuing extremely controversial issues such as the liberalisation of investment, public procurement and services in a projected transatlantic free trade area, other countries could well perceive that as the EU and US setting the stage for transferring the negotiations over to the global level. As you know, they have been extremely highly contested in the WTO framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of regulation and harmonisation, in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary, there is a risk that we will see a levelling down – rather than a levelling up – of hard-won environmental health and consumer standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Global terrorism is a new phenomenon whose extent is not yet fully known, but which has a wide reach and operational capabilities.

<p class="contents">It should also be said, though, that some groups here in this House are not as much interested in the rights of terrorists or alleged terrorists as they are in mainly indulging in basic anti-Americanism. If those groups were as active in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba, for example, much more progress would have been made by now.

<p class="contents">The second topic is Iran. I not only wish you a lot of luck, Mrs Plassnik, I also hope that you can do much work of persuasion here too. We must remain firm in this matter.

Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable? No. Do we want to open up our market to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or to beef from cattle raised on hormones? No. Therefore, I want the transatlantic agenda to be based on practical research of general European interest, and not on unconditional commitment to the doctrine of free trade as a goal in itself.</p>

Regarding international questions it has been pointed out that in recent months progress has been achieved on a range of issues. Here we need to advance slowly and step by step. I would like to thank the Commission, too, for its close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs and all those who have also worked on this report and those who regularly take part in the debate on our transatlantic relations. These relations are central for the European Union and for us all, and so we must avoid adopting one-sided positions. What is needed, rather, is to discuss existing irritations and all unresolved questions as partners in a dialogue. These points must not, however, overshadow that which binds us together or that which is profound and resistant to strain: the shared community of values and the work on the world issues that are important to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me respond to a few question rather briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we plan to sign a new agreement on higher education and vocational training, including launching an innovative transatlantic degree programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As for tourism – which was also mentioned – exchanges would be facilitated by extending the visa waiver programme to all our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the environment, we want to relaunch our dialogue with the US, notably by relaunching the high-level dialogue on the environment, including the issue of climate change. Our cooperation on energy will also touch on climate change issues from the standpoint of energy efficiency. However, our overall dialogue needs to be broader than this.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who might not have been here at the beginning, I would like to come back to the questions of visa waiver and visa reciprocity. These are issues that we not only mention on a regular basis, but they are there in the dialogue, and will certainly be taken up again with President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">On passenger name records and the recent European Court of Justice judgment relating to the cases brought by the European Parliament, we respect the Court’s judgment and analysis and we will fully comply with it. We will cooperate with Parliament, the Council and with the national data protection authorities to ensure that the judgment is fully complied with. We have only four months to find a new legal basis, but I hope we will be able to cooperate in such a way that there will be no lowering of protection standards, no disruption to transatlantic air traffic, and that a high level of security will be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are looking forward to the successful setting-up of the Galileo satellite navigation system, where cooperation with third countries is necessary and useful, and where we hope that cooperation with the US will bring an additional benefit to our companies and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very thankful to the two rapporteurs and for the engagement and commitment of Parliament. It will certainly give us more strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that for all the attention that is occasionally given to disagreements in trade matters between the United States and the European Union, it is worth bearing in mind that 98% of our trade is dispute-free. Where there are disputes, both sides move rapidly, not always with immediate success, but rapidly to resolve these amicably and quickly. That is something we should note and celebrate without being complacent.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that Erika Mann’s report does not actually call for a single free trade area, so those who are opposing it are aiming at the wrong target. What the report calls for is a barrier-free area, a barrier-free transatlantic market between Europe and the United States. That is something that we can applaud and encourage. As I said earlier on, I do not think it will attract the support of some sort of ‘big-bang’ elaborate scheme. However, the fact is that this trade and investment relationship between us is worth a <span class="italic">colossal</span> amount in terms of people’s jobs, their livelihoods, their futures. It is not so much tariffs, anymore, that stand in the way of growth in this relationship; it is non-tariff barriers, regulatory barriers, differences in standards and licensing and all the rest. There is a sort of bonfire of barriers to set alight. These are very noble and correct economic objectives for us to set our hands and our shoulders to. This is why I so heartily commend this report and will dedicate myself and my services to realising its spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Joint action is needed today in areas of common interest and shared values and threats, in order to lend a new, effective and representative dimension to our common policy and economic relations and to combine forces to face the threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Global problems require global and prompt action. The priorities of the UN summit in 2005 and the drafting of a plan of action against terrorism should become our goal and our motivation for cooperation, and should speed up reforms in the structures both of NATO and of the UN, with particular emphasis on the reform of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The decline of the ‘enemy of the Western world’ in Eastern Europe, and disagreement between the Member States on intervention in Iraq, gives rise to a question posed frequently both in the USA and in Europe, namely whether NATO has any useful purpose any more. The threat of terrorism could provide a basis for the existence of the alliance, but this challenge requires the creation of new political and military structures and cooperation with regard to the EU’s foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Steps must be taken to draw up a common strategy on securing supplies of energy and raw materials by diversifying our supply sources, production and transportation, and to intensify political dialogue on renewable sources of energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
