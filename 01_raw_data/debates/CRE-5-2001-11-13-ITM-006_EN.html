<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, general interest services are services of both an economic and non-economic nature which are geared towards the public interest and in whose provision both the public at large and the state have a special interest. In the various Member States of the European Union, this includes supplying the public with services in the fields of energy, water, waste disposal, transport, telecommunications, post, media, finance and insurance, a basic social, educational and training system, social services, external and internal security, a judiciary and a system of registration. You will see from this broad span of services how wide-ranging this subject is.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we concerned with this area? Because some Member States, and, in particular, Germany, have questioned the power of the Commission to take decisions under Article 86 of the EC Treaty, and have also challenged the enactment of secondary Community law such as the transparency directive. I believe that there is no justification for the fears of the <span class="italic">Länder</span> and municipalities that competition law will greatly undermine their powers and destroy the existing network of mature, tried and tested general interest structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we wish Parliament to adopt an opinion on the decisions to be taken by the Heads of State and Government in Laeken, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues very sincerely for their cooperation on this issue. We have been trying for over a year, by means of hearings and a great many debates, to identify a common line. The Commission's behaviour on this issue has been objective and I think I can say successful. I would therefore like to thank the Commission, which I see is still represented here. The Commission has comprehensively described the Community law framework. It has presented the principles of neutrality, freedom of definition and proportionality, which we support, and in response to the question of how more legal certainty is to be achieved, it has proposed the use of exempting regulations and case-by-case decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the questions that have to be resolved. Whereas a good many Members favour an amendment to Article 16, we have agreed to propose a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, the internal market article, which will allow all unresolved issues to be settled, and using the codecision procedure, this is not to be a Council regulation or a Commission instrument, but a directive under the codecision procedure, so that we will be able to fully participate in decision making on these marginal issues under competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two pivotal points in the debate: to what extent can we maintain structures that have developed along traditional lines or need to be opened up with regard to free markets and competition? Secondly, to what extent is it permissible for the state to subsidise general interest services? And if so, is there a difference between public and private companies? What general interest services come under EU law? Activities not included are all those of a non-economic nature and those that are purely national. What does this cover? EU competition law assumes that companies are involved and in this case we have the controls on state aid under Articles 87 to 89. The internal market rules refer to economic activities, and in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are activities relating to sovereignty which the state has effectively reserved to itself, and there are institutions which do not fall into this category, which are neither companies nor state institutions, the "independent charitable associations" or not-for-profit organisations which the Commission refers to in its observations on Article 30, as do we. The EU's competition rules and the internal market rules are not applicable to purely internal national matters. This is particularly relevant to general interest services at regional and local level. If they are applicable, then there are exemption arrangements, such as the <span class="italic">de minimis </span>rule, such as aids for culture and such as the exempting regulations for small and medium-sized enterprises and other bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Commission has given us a head start by means of this framework, and one with which we basically agree, in cases where we want to establish legal certainty on issues that we have openly debated and in cases where we want to declare the free market, competition in the market, to be a fundamental principle. I would like to ask honourable Members to actively support the compromise that we worked out in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was in favour of the introduction of private-sector television from the very outset, as I still am, whilst being convinced, in the final analysis, that we must work on the assumption that a public-service broadcasting remit is necessary. Two particular aspects must be highlighted here: on the one hand the obligation to provide a service to all, that is, overall popular provision under appropriate conditions, and on the other the obligation to reflect the pluralistic nature of our society. The dual broadcasting system has proved itself. There would be no sense in constantly requiring the public broadcasters to justify every single programme. A balanced programme needs leeway.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also certain is that we cannot allow taxes and licence fees to finance the creation of a public-service copy of the private-sector service providers. The public media need leeway, but also clarification of their role and standards for fulfilling it. It is in this respect that the communication from the Commission is particularly to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">It also needs to be made clear, however, that, in the case of services with social welfare in mind, the type of transmission – be it terrestrial or videostreaming – cannot be crucial. What matters are the objectives to be safeguarded, our democratic foundational principles, pluralism and free access to culture and to technological progress. We must of course guarantee the protection of the users, especially of the young. In terms of competition law, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must restrict itself to watching out for misuse. It must continue to respect and defend the competence of Member States as regards the content of programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulatory authority must then remain with the Member States, and it is therefore incumbent on them too to determine financial and organisational structures. I welcome the fact the Commission and the Council are endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the Member States about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was adopted by the Committee almost unanimously, with only one member casting a blank vote. The draftsman does not share the Commission’s view that compliance with the rules governing competition and the internal market is fully compatible with safeguarding the supply of services of general interest. The problem arising is how to safeguard the supply of such services.</p>
<p class="contents">The draftsman proposes the creation of a European joint responsibility framework to cover services of general interest. He considers that more open and more democratic regulation is a necessity, also in the conditions that will prevail following the potential enlargement of the EU. The draftsman wishes to make the tasks clearer and at the same time to strengthen the communities’ and states’ freedom of choice regarding the selection of a model for safeguarding these services and the type of administration to be set up for this purpose. While the current market philosophy and rules of competition encourage privatisation, the EU should retain the principle of diversity, or in other words, there should be a number of options to choose from.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these arguments the committee has adopted an opinion according to which the gradual process of freeing service industries must be implemented in parallel with retaining general services. The principle according to which it is up to the Member States, within their own territories, to retain their cultural habits and political views has also been adopted. The Member States should have the right to ensure that services of general interest are also provided to the less advantaged of their citizens. In paying particular attention to the problems presented by the financing and its safeguarding, the committee in its opinion shares the draftsman’s concern about the necessity to safeguard general services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens, and indeed enterprises, of today, work on the assumption that a broad spectrum of such services will be generally available, with high quality and at affordable prices.</p>
<p class="contents">By 'services of general interest' is understood activities engaged in for the general good and therefore linked by the authorities with specific social welfare obligations and benefits. Such services make a significant contribution to improving citizens' quality of life and thus play a significant part in maintaining the social, human and geographical cohesion of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle clarifies responsibilities at regional and national level. The meaning of 'social welfare interest' is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It has therefore been important for me as President of the Austrian Welfare Service to clarify my position with respect to the major social institutions and health organisations, with the Red Cross, Caritas, the Welfare Service, the sports clubs, the fire brigades, the parishes and towns. It was also important for me to observe that the specifically rural areas are involved, that the candidate countries through which the EU is to be enlarged are involved and that the significance of 'non profit organisations' in the service of the public is clearly expressed.

<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, day after day I see judgments being passed, which show just how far ahead case law is on this issue, in comparison to our legislation. In a judgment dated 25 October 2001, this case law again justified certain restrictions on competition where these are necessary for carrying out the task in question in order to achieve economic and social balance.</p>
<p class="contents">So, when you consider the timeliness of this framework directive, you must also consider the organisation of services of general interest. And, from that point of view, this would mean knowing which authority is responsible for services of general interest. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we are calling for all levels of the European Union to be involved, whether at European or local level, both in defining the scope of services of general interest as well as in the ways that they are organised.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern relates to consistency between the general approach towards services of general interest and the sectoral approach. This is because there is no point defining the framework if there is a lack of cohesion between one sector and another. Our group will therefore oppose a number of paragraphs which fall within a sectoral approach that we will not support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would lastly like to touch on the issue of funding. The Commission recently proposed a new text which deals with an exemption regime in the sector of services of general interest. We shall support this proposal which we believe must be supplemented by an approach that enables cross-funding, without which adjustments are not possible, and that threatens, over the long term, the functioning of general interest services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, the basic objective in this connection should be to step up competition in favour of the citizen and to determine the pre-conditions on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of services of general interest should be a matter to be decided upon by the Member States, and subsidiarity should be a keyword in this connection. It is essential to accomplish the internal market in the way it was agreed in Lisbon. That is why, in the interest of the citizen, swift progress should be made with the ongoing liberalisation of postal services, transport, electricity and gas – and water as well, as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Current liberalisation has contributed greatly to the competitiveness of European businesses and has also benefited the European citizen. Citizens should have a choice, particularly in the case of products which are so important in everyday life. Citizens must be regarded as consumers rather than objects.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why services of general interest must be provided in a competitive manner everywhere. It is important for a sufficient number of market operators to enter the market, and that is why the same conditions of access must apply to public and private businesses alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizen also benefits from clarity in the field of prices, bills and supplies. In addition, high quality must be delivered. This should, of course, go hand in hand with the correct and prompt handling of complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Efficiency, for example with a view to an improved guarantee of supply, should also be on the agenda. Furthermore, the market for other products, such as water, must be opened up so that the citizen can reap the benefits there too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the drafting of a framework directive, I would prefer to await the Commission position in Laeken. At the moment, we are actually opposed to a framework directive. We must carefully consider whether such a directive is in fact necessary, and we should only draft legislation if it is required. We should not make it more opaque than it already is.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I should like to thank the rapporteur, including for the consultation he has entered into with all of us. In all honesty, I thought his original proposal was the best and the Commission has since then made every effort to tone things down. Our voting behaviour will therefore be able to hit quite a critical note in that respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, the current economic situation and the numerous job losses that have been announced in recent weeks, coupled with the fact that, even during a period of strong growth, we have had an average unemployment rate of 8% in recent years, highlight the absolute need to develop services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group fully supports the voluntarist guidelines drawn up, in the main, by the European Confederation of Trade Unions and by the European Liaison Committee on services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for Europe. It is now deemed to be insufficient, and that is why we are supporting the draft framework directive and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We expect the Laeken European Council, part of which will be dedicated to the European Union’s objectives, to clearly set forth this objective on services of general interest and the framework directive as well as a timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is of crucial importance. As in the case of procedures for public procurement contracts, which the Zappala report tackled, and as in the case of a particular sector such as public transport, which the Meijer report dealt with, we are required to adopt a framework for the policy on European competition, to develop a policy on regulated competition, to enable national, regional or local public authorities, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, to determine the missions of general interest services, the management contract that is to be fulfilled by the operators and the funding of these missions. This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 52 and 55 that we have tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that we must insist on carrying out a much more in-depth evaluation on the liberalisation of sectors, taking into consideration the interests of consumers and workers and the compatibility of market guidelines with the objectives of sustainable development – I am thinking of the water sector, for example – and not only from a technical point of view, but equally through dialogue with all the actors involved. This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 44 and 46.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it was necessary to present the various amendments to the House once again obviously indicates that what I have just said about objectives, and above all, about the resources to be implemented, has not received unanimous support.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, in this field as in others, it is greater European integration that we need, whilst respecting the Community method and guaranteeing that public figures at all levels take the proper action to ensure the provision of general interest services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The contribution of these has led to the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises the essential role of services of general interest in ensuring social and territorial cohesion. The Commission’s proposals, however, contain the usual double language. On the one hand, there is reference to the interests of citizens, and therefore to the need for services of general interest, whilst on the other, several of the Commission’s directives accentuate liberalisation and deregulation of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Langen report supports the spirit of the Commission’s communication of September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe. The Commission acknowledges that competition cannot meet all the requirements of citizens and that Member States have good reason to set up and implement services of general interest. At the same time, however, the Commission states that the progress of liberalisation is positive and relies on the content of the Lisbon meeting of the Council of Ministers to step up this process. The report has been improved by the debate and the amendments. It has made a real effort to adopt a balanced position between liberalisation and public services, it also stresses that services of general interest must ensure equal access, security of supply and continuity. It also proposes to assess the actual impact of liberalisation before embarking on any new phases, as my group suggested on many occasions. However, we still have a long way to go before we meet the required demands for services of general interest that are worthy of the name. The Langen report claims to relentlessly pursue liberalisation in sectors such as transport, electricity and gas and the postal services. Furthermore, it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that services of general interest, as their name suggests, must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands. In other words, this means providing transparency, continuity and equality. We need a new European model of services of general interest that meets citizens’ aspirations, and we must stop approaching this issue solely from the point of view of competition, as advocated in the report. That is why I do not think it is wise, and I think it could even be dangerous, to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach. Yes, I believe that we need safeguards. I am in favour of a framework directive on services of general interest on the condition that it maintains the social benefits that these provide in terms of employment, security and sustainable regional development. This directive should also ensure the respect of service obligations in terms of quality, equality, access for all users, and also by maintaining reserved areas allowing price offsetting on a geographical basis and on social grounds. I also think that all levels of the European Union must be involved. Our position will be related to whether or not a number of amendments are accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity. The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission. It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly. If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin. Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit? Let me mention only ambulance services.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the issue of checking for misuse. The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water. For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area. I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union – and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject. We reject this decisively. Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first. I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Services of general interest are now an outstanding example of this, an example made more problematic by the additional factor that the objectives of services of general interest are similar in the Member States. The instruments, however, sometimes differ significantly as a consequence not only of different cultural developments, but also of the Member States' differing administrative structures. The drawing-up of shared rules is not exactly made easier by this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must, however, continue in future to be able to decide what services they will categorise as being of general interest. On the other hand, the rules must be as similar as possible in a common internal market. Competition law, as laid down in the Treaty, provides on its own insufficient legal certainty when it comes to framing them. On the other hand, the objective should not be to empty European competition law of its meaning. It must therefore be interpreted in a binding way for the purposes of services of public interest. We accordingly call for a framework directive to determine the Community principles on which services of general interest are to be founded.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive should lay down rules for the Member States. Above all, though, it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest. Thirdly, it should limit the space available for the Commission to exercise its discretion. Its executive monopoly should not be infringed, but as far as its decisions in individual cases and its block exemption regulations are concerned, I would like to see it laid down what, for example, are 'economic activities' and what are not. What falls at this arbitrary threshold? When is intra-Community trade affected? Above all, the many sectoral directives and regulations on which we are working at present must give direction to the legislative work in various sectors done by those of us in the European Parliament…</p>

<p class="contents">Contrary to the misleading assertions made in the report, privatisation brings about poorer services and social discrimination that affects those on the lowest incomes. Activities are reduced or withdrawn in order to avoid making private profit, and these are still just as essential to the population. And there can be no other approach. The private companies that benefit from the erosion of public services are motivated by making maximum profits for their shareholders and not by the need to satisfy the general interest as best they can. The policy to hand over public services to private interests is a policy pursued by the European institutions and the national governments, and represents a major social step backwards. Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supply, and refuse collection must remain public services which must not generate profits…</p>

If that means increased and fairer competition in postal services, transport, water supply, social services and so on, this can only be agreed to. If, though, simple considerations of cost mean that the quality of service drops, with ever fewer service providers being available and ever fewer people being employed, this proposal merits political resistance. State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies. Mr Langen, the rapporteur, has taken on board my suggestion that tasks of general interest should be acknowledged to be common European values. They contribute to the European social model and to the sustainable development of the EU's regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to guarantee high standards of quality and safety, range of provision and continuity in a healthy price/service ratio. As before, the Member States' offers for tender will independently determine which yardstick to apply as regards environmental friendliness, availability and social standards. It is for the good of all citizens if these services are unambiguously defined in the context of a European law on the placing of contracts. Exceptions from the internal market's competition and market regulations should include local, social and charitable services which do not work with their eye on profit and are committed to meeting the needs of the weak and those on the margins of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens and service users are to be comprehensively involved in the Member States' and the Commission's efforts to make this agreement reality. New regulations on services of general interest in the EU will only be accepted if transparency and involvement are ensured. As a member not only of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also of that on Employment and Social Affairs, I recommend that this House approve this report, which is excellent because it is balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Initially we have to address this question of services of general interest from the point of view of the rights of citizens, for the rights of consumers are a subset of those rights. Citizenship confers rights which entitle one to various essential needs such as water, which is essential to human life. Water cannot be treated within the European Union simply as a commodity to be bought and sold.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is committed to the idea of a distinct social model based on solidarity. It is therefore essential that we have a legal framework, a regulatory framework, within which the Commission and Member States can address the question of competition as it affects social services, public services, and services of general interest. It is part of a democratic agenda for the European Union to ensure that we are accountable, that the services we provide are accountable, and that we have a Europe which is developed as a socially inclusive Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The economy has to be an instrument to serve the people, not simply to serve the market. Rights of the consumer being defined on the basis of purchasing power is not an adequate way to develop a cohesive social Europe. It is a Europe where politics is denigrated because it is simply based on people's capacity to buy or not to buy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has played its part by presenting two communications on this subject and most recently a report to the Laeken European Council. Essentially we are all inspired by the same will to ensure that every citizen in Europe has access to high-quality services of general interest. The European Union has direct responsibilities with regard to those sectors for which internal market legislation has been introduced, essentially for network industries. In each case, specific provisions have been devoted to public service obligations. All this legislation has been adopted under codecision and is continuing to evolve. The package of proposals on energy adopted by the Commission this spring comprises greatly strengthened elements relating to public service obligations. Member States have a duty to specify and implement those obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, in sectors not covered by specific Community legislation, Member States and their constituted authorities have the main role to play, for instance in the organisation and provision of local and social services. Here the Commission limits itself to ensuring compatibility with competition and internal market rules in general. Those rules, as emphasised by the Langen report, are quite flexible. In particular they provide for adequate financing of services of general interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly been requested to provide greater legal security with regard to the general competition and internal market rules applicable to services of general interest. By explaining and developing its approach, it has attempted to put the fears expressed by operators and others involved to rest. The Commission proposes to continue to use examples, guidelines and communications, together with proposals for regulations on exemptions, to provide further clarification, as called for in the Langen report.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to Laeken, the Commission has undertaken to establish a Community framework for state aid granted for services of general economic interest. That framework could, in particular, specify the conditions for the authorisation of state aid schemes by the Commission, thus alleviating the notification obligation for individual aid. This may lead to the adoption of a regulation exempting certain categories of aid from the obligation of prior notification.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of a proposed framework directive, the Commission is not opposed in principle and has already agreed to assess the value and feasibility of such an instrument. Our doubts concern mainly the articulation between such a directive and legislation at sectoral level. In the light of the European Parliament's resolution, the Commission will look at the subject again.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major issue concerns evaluation. I repeat that the Commission has every interest in rigorous, complete and honest evaluation of the results of Community legislation. That is good practice; it is also good governance and it should not be neglected, either at Member State or at European level. We propose to improve on existing sectoral evaluations and we have agreed to present an annual horizontal report in the context of the Cardiff process. The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's proposal to organise a debate in the existing forums in order to ensure a pluralist assessment and the debate ought to take place before the preparation of the Cardiff report in order to take full account of its results and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I stress that services of general interest are an area of ongoing concern which will require new initiatives in future and further development of Community legislation. The Commission looks forward to involving the European Parliament as a partner in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
