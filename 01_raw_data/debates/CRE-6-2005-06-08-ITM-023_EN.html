<p class="contents">We must in fact make every reasonable effort to reduce emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in order to protect health and the environment. These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances. According to the UNECE protocol, they are also classified as persistent organic pollutants.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these particular hydrocarbons are ingredients in extender oils used in the production of tyres and therefore cause health and environmental problems. That is why the Commission has proposed introducing harmonised restrictions on the marketing and use of oils containing these PAKs, and on tyres containing these oils.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal will ensure that the internal market in tyres is maintained and that national measures which create trade barriers to the free movement of goods are avoided. Alternatives to the substances to be restricted are being developed by industry. In order to give industry the time needed to adjust to the new standards laid down in this directive, the Commission has proposed a reasonable transition period for the transposition of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council have tabled a workable compromise package, with amendments on the later introduction of measures and testing requirements and deleting unnecessary exemptions for certain sectors. The Commission supports these amendments. I would like to encourage Parliament to accept the proposal at first reading, together with the amendments forming part of this compromise package. This will demonstrate that the European institutions are willing and able to address such problems without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an important development, if you consider that the European tyre industry produces around 300 million tyres annually and uses 250 000 tonnes of extender oils, which are incorporated into the rubber matrix and remain in the rubber used for the end tyre. These oils contain certain quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, as well as persistent organic pollutants.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its initiative to extend Annex 1 to Directive 76/769 by the addition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to car tyres. I consider that its proposal is a very good proposal. Taking as a starting point the protection of public health and the environment, as well as public safety and the smooth functioning of the internal market, and following consultations both with the Commission and the Council, as well as with the tyre and oil industry and non-governmental organisations, I tried to draft a balanced report, which was amended accordingly by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issues which concerned us were the duration of the transitional period for the application of the directive, the method of detecting the toxic substances which would be used and the question of exemptions from the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Following consultations with the Council and in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, a package of amendments was proposed, which has been endorsed by most of the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, I have recommended the tabled amendments, so that we can bring this matter to a smooth conclusion at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In detail and as regards the transitional period, which is considered necessary in order to develop new types of tyres with extender oils which contain the minimum quantity of the substances which concern us, it is proposed that it be extended to 1 January 2010. We should point out here that, for environmental reasons, we decided to take account of the date of manufacture of the tyre, which is marked on the tyre itself. That is because the destruction of tyres remaining in stock is also harmful – perhaps even more harmful – to the environment and, of course, we are also helping industry to dispose of these stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Federation of Tyre Manufacturers has assured us in writing that it can apply the criteria in the directive to all types of tyres, including tyres for racing cars, aeroplanes and special vehicles and vintage cars, without any risk to driver safety. We therefore propose that there should be no exemption in the application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I received three faxes protesting that we should grant extensions. I have spoken to all three senders and, when I explained the compromise proposal, they appeared to agree with it. One of them even apologised for his ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the methods for detecting and defining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Commission has proposed limiting the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene, the substance which will act as a marker for the entire group, to 1 mg per kilogramme or, taking all listed PAHs, to no more than 10 mg per kilogramme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, industry has used IP 346 method of the Institute of Petroleum for PAC-dimethyl sulfoxide extract, which must not exceed 3%. Its inclusion has been proposed, given that it is the traditional method used. So much for extender oils. As far as the oil content in car tyres is concerned, as ISO 21461 method has been developed in order to detect this type of oils in tyres, it is proposed that it be defined in the directive as an addendum to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last amendment concerns retreading, on which the Commission proposal contains no provisions. Tread for retreading may not be placed on the market if it contains extender oils exceeding the limits indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to thank both the shadow rapporteurs, for their excellent cooperation, and the secretarial staff of the Committee on the Environment, as well as the Council for its constructive proposals and cooperation, which will allow us to bring this matter to a close at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously he has not, as he is not listening to what we are saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on his report. It was a difficult and very technical report and required a certain amount of skill. I also wish to congratulate the tyre manufacturers, because over the years they have improved road safety, the availability of tyres and also the tread and the capacity of the tyre to stick to the road. That was why I know that my fellow rapporteur had a slight problem with the date 2010. I realise that he wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal of 2009, but a number of tyres could not be changed for that date and that is why we opted for the date on the tyre. I am delighted to hear that he has accepted that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission and the Council have accepted, because we have come forward with a compromise package for its acceptance. Particularly in the current climate, after the French and the Dutch votes, people often see the Council and the Commission – the Commission in particular – as aloof from Parliament, the only democratically elected body that represents the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Adamou quite rightly mentioned Annex I and I am grateful to him for going through all the technical details for something we totally accept and agree with. This report is a triumph for Parliament and I am delighted that we have come up with a compromise package. I am just sorry the Commissioner is unable to listen to what we are saying and is too busy texting people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has consulted painstakingly and taken due note of the views expressed by all the main players. In addition, I commend the productive efforts and efficient methodology employed in bringing about full and genuine cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs for all the main political groups. This has led to the achievement of a compromise package of amendments, which appears to have been widely accepted by most parliamentary groups, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the substance of the directive, with the compromise amendments, this will to a very large degree achieve the intended aims, i.e., to effect, as soon as practicably possible, a reduction in the emission of carcinogenic tyre debris into the environment to an acceptable level, by restricting the marketing and use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-rich extender oils and tyres. That would be done by harmonising the rules on the marketing and use of extender oils and tyres containing these toxic substances, thus preserving and improving the conditions and functioning of the internal market, while making sure that a high degree of health and environmental protection is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it should be mentioned that there have, sadly, been a few direct and indirect attempts by some transatlantic tyre manufacturers to manipulate the derailing of the effectiveness clause of this directive. It is to the credit of the rapporteur and the shadows that fortunately logic and a sense of preservation of the EU’s high standards of safety and efficiency prevailed and such attempts fortunately failed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a good example, demonstrating clearly that unity and common sense will always protect us against the ‘big brother’ approach sometimes propagated by a small number of US industrialists and politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I strongly urge you to vote in favour of the compromise amendment package presented to you in connection with Mr Adamou’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that most groups but also the Commission, the Council and industry are nearly all of the same mind is the result of sound work put in by Mr Adamou.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I, along with others apparently, was approached by an aircraft tyre manufacturer who informed me that the extensive tests and security requirements to which aircraft tyres are subjected will make it impossible for him to keep to the 2010 deadline. I assume that the rapporteur and Commissioner have also been approached, and I should like to know whether those objections have any real value.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to hear from the Commissioner what his opinion is on the matter and whether aircraft tyre manufacturers are now able to meet the requirements of the compromise package. I was under the impression, from my contacts over the past six months, that that should be feasible, but I am very keen to hear your reaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commission line is broadly acceptable, Parliament should support it without watering down the issue to any greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative initiative under discussion is a natural extension to the directive that was drafted in Parliament’s last term and in which we laid down limit and target values for impurities in the air and PAHs for 1996. As we now decide a suitable timetable and limit values for PAH emissions passing into the rest of the environment, we have a challenging task before us. PAHs are everywhere and they occur as multicomponent blends. In international toxicology assessments several carcinogenic compounds have been identified among PAHs. PAHs do not dissolve in water, they accumulate in the food chain, and they return to the carbon cycle when released into the environment, thus causing lasting damage to nature. Accordingly, we should agree common testing procedures in order to bring emissions under control swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time now development and testing work has been conducted on tyres, and, indeed, the first tyres containing a safer oil are already on the market. Traffic, in which the tyres that are used and the limit values for their extender oils we now want to regulate, is in itself ecologically problematic. Traffic emissions are one of the commonest and worst spreaders of PAHs into the air we breathe. It is from tyre debris in particular that large quantities of compounds in the form of small particles are released into the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular problem with tyres and extender oils is benzopyrene, which, unfortunately, is very often used in these products. This PAH is the best-known and worst carcinogenic substance. We must now define sustainable limit values which will reduce emissions of benzopyrene into the environment to a minimum, at the same time recognising the necessity of extender oils in the tyre industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of their toxicity, we are today debating their restriction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have before us a compromise which will probably be accepted tomorrow by a large majority. Happy though I am when we avoid ideological debates on technical issues and adopt slim directives in a short space of time, there are a couple of minor but important aspects that we have overlooked. A proposed amendment, which I jointly initiated and which was originally accepted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, aimed to obtain an extension to 2012 for certain urgently needed technical applications. These were exceptions for armoured, fire brigade, rescue and other special purpose vehicles. The number of applications is extremely minor and the damage to the environment negligible.</p>
<p class="contents">The original exemption for aircraft tyres, to which no time limit was originally attached, was also buried in the compromise package. On this point, Parliament is about to take an irresponsible decision. The aviation sector operates at physical limits, which is why the safety aspect must not be compromised and must even come before environmental aspects. Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres.</p>
<p class="contents">I fail to understand how the Council could totally disregard this aspect, especially as the European Aviation Safety Agency was not consulted and there has been no follow-up assessment on it. I am not in favour of more bureaucracy, but in such a safety sensitive sector as aviation, more careful attention should have been paid to the risks, especially as this is what we do with other regulations in the environmental sector where we often rush past the target.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a letter from the European Cockpit Association, which represents 34 000 pilots in Europe and expresses great concern about this. I wish to highlight this, because the pilots certainly cannot be suspected of engaging in industrial lobbying. I would like to know from Commissioner Verheugen whether he is aware of this problem. As I see it, this compromise is unacceptable if this aspect is disregarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no excuse for us; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from. We make tyres with them, but we also create them when we burn waste. The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators, some for toxic waste, be created in my country, thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water, air, soil, plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc. Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators, especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reply to Mr Blokland's question is in the negative; no tyre manufacturers have contacted me, nor would I have advised any of them to do so, for they would have received the same reply that I am giving you now. The Commission has examined the problem carefully. We have received a formal statement from European tyre manufacturers to the effect that the technical requirements of this directive will also be met by the year 2010 for aircraft tyres. That is therefore also my reply to Mr Krahmer, whose concerns about the safety of aircraft I fully and completely share. I also think that, as far as the composition of tyres is concerned, tyre manufacturers are rather more qualified than pilots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
