He also stated that hundreds of his fellow citizens had been imprisoned for claiming and defending those rights. The situation in Cuba remains unchanged. Amongst those arrested and sentenced in the last wave of repression are human rights defenders and peaceful dissidents. Many of them were members of the Christian Liberation Movement, and involved in the Varela Project. Independent journalists such as Raúl Rivero were also targeted. This gentleman is 57 years of age and received a 20-year prison sentence. Others sentenced include Omar Rodríguez, a photographer, who received a 27-year sentence and another journalist, Víctor Rolando Arroyo, sentenced to 26 years in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is no accident that Cuba is the only Latin American country not linked to the European Union by virtue of an association or cooperation agreement. These regrettable events illustrate why this is so. Sadly, the events took place just as the European Commission opened a representation in Havana, and when our institutions and many Members of this House were favourably disposed towards extending participation in the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba. I urge the Commissioner to condemn these events and further, to state the conclusions the Commission intends to draw from them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Mr President, I believe Parliament must first reject and strongly condemn these events, as provided for by the joint resolution. Parliament has to stand firm and continue to insist on freedom as a prerequisite. Secondly, Parliament must express its solidarity with all those fighting for their freedom and dignity inside Cuba. To paraphrase Oswaldo Payá, they feel no hate in their hearts as they fight, but no fear of their oppressors either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Which is why he is scared to death of democratic reforms and is eliminating opponents. In the shadow of Iraq, Fidel now sees his opportunity to put more than 75 dissidents and independent journalists behind bars for a villainously long time. Their only crime is that they disagree with the regime, are open about it and are possibly supported by the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">On my visit to Cuba in December it became clear to me that Cuba wants better relations with the European Union and is keen to accede to the Cotonou Agreement. To this end the Commission office was recently opened in Havana. Four days later came the arrests. What a slap in the face of the European Union! If the political detainees are not released, the question arises as to what the point is of a political dialogue and of a European Union office. Nor do any negotiations need to be conducted with regard to the Cotonou Agreement. I would like to hear what Commissioner Bolkestein has to say on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As human rights rapporteur I have spoken to many Cuban authorities, including the Vice President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately, I have to say now that they wrong-footed me with their evasive answers. Political processes behind closed doors are old Soviet practices for which there is no longer a place in a civilised world. The American boycott is ill-advised. Cuba is crazy about dollars. That is why a new invasion is needed. Not of soldiers but of peaceful visitors from America and Cuba. Democrats of the world unite ... in Cuba and give Castro a fright, by opening not only your wallet but also your mouth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Group protests with great indignation at the monstrous wave of repression that has crashed down on anyone who dares to dissent, disagree, think differently or create freely in Cuba. This incredible wave of repression reveals, to anyone still harbouring doubts or illusions, the true nature of the Cuban political regime. This is a totalitarian regime that could be called Orwellian, in other words, of the type imagined by George Orwell in his masterpiece entitled ‘nineteen eighty-four’. Once Cuban music, symbolised by Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer and their Buena Vista Social Club, was liberated we thought that we would also see the liberation of the spoken word – poetry –embodied by Raúl Rivero, a great poet who has been sentenced to twenty years in prison. And the liberation of political speech, personified by Elizardo Sanchez and Osvaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, however, what has happened. We were deceived. The Cuban dictator has had intellectuals, journalists, political dissidents and members of the Varela project arrested and brutally repressed, using the usual pretexts and means employed by any common or garden dictatorship: spying on its citizens, arbitrary imprisonment, court-room farces and absurd sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no good or bad dictatorships, Mr President. All dictatorships are intrinsically evil. There is no point in grading them on a scale of evilness and calling Fidel Castro’s dictatorship ‘benign’. It makes no sense for the left to call Fidel Castro’s dictatorship a ‘respectable’ dictatorship. I personally wish to protest against this!</p>
<p class="contents">The cynical, barefaced and shameless breach of fundamental freedoms and human rights now represents a challenge and a provocation thrown down by Fidel Castro to all citizens and democratic countries. We must unite our efforts to isolate Cuba politically. I am not talking about economic isolation, because in fact the US economic embargo has provided the greatest excuse for the Cuban dictatorship. I am talking about moral and political isolation. We must support the dissident Cuban socialist Elizardo Sanchez, who has spent eight years in Fidel’s prisons and heads the Committee on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, when he demonstrates exemplary courage by stating in an interview with a French newspaper on the subject of this wave of repression, that what is being called into question in Cuba – these are his words – ‘is the totalitarian model’, which has failed there as elsewhere, and calls it an obscene model, adding that the Cuban regime is in its final throes. These are troubled times for dictatorships, Mr President. I fervently hope that democracy will triumph in Cuba and that the admirable Cuban people will regain the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to demonstrate, the freedom of speech, and the freedom to travel beyond their island. In short, I pray that the Cuban people recover the dreams which underpinned a revolution that I have always supported, but whose most important ideas have been betrayed and negated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has carried out this action with shocking cynicism and brutality, taking advantage of the international crisis, in the belief that since the world’s attentions are currently focused on another part of the globe – Iraq – international attention would be shifted and would therefore allow him to unleash all his rage and fury on those citizens who disagree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Were this situation not so tragic, we might say, given this proof of Fidel Castro’s regime once again showing its true colours; that communism and Stalinism are like riding a bicycle: once you have learned how, you never forget. We in the UEN Group support the joint motion for a resolution, the compromise resolution that has been tabled and that will certainly be adopted. I wish, however, to say something further about the action that we feel should be taken. We believe that we in the European Parliament have a particular responsibility at the moment because last December we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá. We cannot abandon our Cuban brothers and sisters to their fate and we must show that awarding the Sakharov Prize serves some purpose. A European Parliament delegation must go to Cuba without delay to meet these detainees and particularly Oswaldo Payá. We must once again express our solidarity and once again invite Oswaldo Payá to come to Strasbourg for the May part-session. If he cannot come in May, then in June and if he cannot come in June, then in July, to tell us what is happening in Cuba. We must act rapidly, to show our solidarity with our Cuban brothers and sisters.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the European Union has already expressed its condemnation. This is important and is to be welcomed but it is not enough. We must do more; we must send a clear message to the Cuban dictator that we do not accept this, and that we shall not concede on this matter. We must put Cuba’s application for Cotonou membership on hold, and we must show quite clearly that we are prepared to support the Cuban situation changing to become a regime of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, but also that we shall not give in to any backsliding and particularly to any renewal of this Stalinist brutality. Let us call for the immediate release of all detainees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the severest wave of repression for ten years the dictator wants to rid himself of dissidents who are disagreeable to him. Sudden, mass arrests of critics of his regime are followed by quick show trials. The first so-called ‘traitors’ were picked up in mid-March. Last Monday the first draconian punishments had already been fixed in a judicial process that rode roughshod over international legal standards. Cubans who did nothing other than exercise their right to free speech were charged with subversive activities. This serious charge gives Castro the chance to impose excessively severe punishments under Law 88. This violation of the international legal order is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely now that the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which has been extremely critical of Cuba, is meeting in Geneva. It is precisely now that the European Union has opened official representation in Havana. It is precisely now that Castro is attempting to seize his chance in the shadow of the liberation of Iraq. We must put a stop to this. In the resolution we argue for the immediate release of all detainees and an end to these dubious detentions. Only then can the European Union consider the continuation of the political dialogue with Cuba and the accession of that island to the Cotonou Agreement. To which I would add the Cuban request to accede to the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, our group has strongly criticised what we consider the unduly harsh sentences handed down to the Cuban dissidents referred to earlier in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we state clearly that freedom of expression and assembly must be respected as the fundamental rights they are. It is important however to take account of the context in which these sentences came about. Firstly, the embargo or blockade, call it what you will, which has had drastic social and economic consequences for Cuba over the last 40 years, and which the international community has condemned at the United Nations year after year. Secondly, the constant harassment by the representative of the United States in Havana for the last six months. That individual, Mr James Cason, has drawn on substantial financial resources to destabilise Cuban institutions. The sum of USD 20 million has been mentioned. Thirdly, the incredible leniency shown by the United States to those who hijacked two aircraft and a vessel during the last month, putting hundreds of lives at risk. Fourthly, the imprisonment of five Cuban citizens sentenced in the United States without guarantees. This was simply for attempting to prevent the terrorist attacks that took place a few months ago in tourist establishments. They caused serious damage, injury, and the death of an Italian holidaymaker. It was because the situation on the island had not been taken into account that we decided not to sign this joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude by expressing a personal view. I believe it is regrettable that the majority of Members who are being so severe on Cuba today should have voted last year against the resolution calling for diplomatic relations with Israel to be broken. This was because of the repeated killing of Palestinians, many of whom were children. Thirty-four Palestinians have been murdered over the last three days. I also believe the vote against any proposal or amendment to condemn or stop the illegal, immoral and unjust war against Iraq during the last mini-session was most regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not know what to make of these double standards. Such an attitude is unfair above all to the victims. These run into the hundreds in Palestine. We may never know the number of victims in Iraq, as history tends to be written by the victors.</p>

All these individuals had done was to attempt to exercise their right to rights, as Oswaldo Payá explained in his address to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This amounts to a flagrant violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. In a sense too, it is a response to the Varela Project. The House is honour bound to respond with strong condemnation of the actions of the Castro regime and that caricature of justice subservient to the dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The House must call for all those imprisoned to be released. It must also speak out against what Oswaldo Payá described as the fallacy or myth that Cubans have to live without rights to sustain the independence and sovereignty of their country. Fundamental rights are not negotiable and their infringement can never be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">We are called on to assure those fighting for the rights of all Cubans that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them and that their fight is our fight also. Indeed, it is our moral and political duty to do so. We should also assure those who have found the courage to support the Varela Project that we support their efforts to re-empower the people of Cuba by constitutional means.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do more than simply condemn, however. I therefore call on the Commissioner to reject Cuba’s request to participate in the Cotonou Agreement if by the time the request comes up for consideration repression still persists and those detained have not been released. I would call on the Council to act in this way too, if the Council were represented here today. Article 9(2) of the aforementioned agreement requires Cuba to make a commitment to human rights. In no way can such a commitment be compatible with the repression currently endured by so many Cuban citizens merely because of their love of freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we must express clear condemnation of the Fidel Castro regime, but we must also attempt to help the Cuban people, who are currently both suffering from the effects of an embargo and the victims of oppression. We must not make the mistake of failing to understand the tragedy of this people and we – including the Commission – must strive to intervene in the Cuban situation in such a way as to isolate the Cuban regime while upholding the fundamental and economic rights of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of those who – while realising that these few minutes will not allow an in-depth analysis of the situation in Cuba – upheld the need for a resolution to be adopted now on the arrests and, in particular, on the sentences, which are not just excessive but groundless. The incredible thing is that we are talking about detentions and even death sentences. The incredible thing is that the regime is actually in earnest, given that sentences as long as 26 years have already been inflicted. I would also like to point out to the Members that political persuasion is no guarantee of safety here, for countless Social Democrats have seen the inside of Fidel Castro’s prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">I too, therefore, consider that we in turn must send out a clear message, and we await the reaction of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself visited Cuba a few years ago on behalf of Liberal International. That has to be one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had anywhere in the world.

<p class="contents">I am therefore puzzled by the remarks of Mrs González, who ventures to say that what is happening in Cuba is a good thing, because she does not think much of the United States as a country, because she disapproves of the war in Iraq and because the situation in Israel is unsatisfactory.

I see the arrests made in recent weeks as a thank you for our support for Cuba’s entry into the ACP, a thank you for Commissioner Nielson’s visit two or three weeks ago and for the opening of a Commission office in Cuba. The dictator, Fidel Castro, has shown us his appreciation. This resolution, which expresses clear condemnation, does not, however, say what we should do – and Mr Ribeiro e Castro mentioned this – it does not say what the European Union ought to do to put an end to this dictatorship. It does not suggest suspending the aid provided by the Member States as well as that provided by the Commission or suspending any negotiations on the Cotonou agreements: no specific measure is proposed for putting pressure on the Cuban Government. It follows that, should the dictator, Fidel Castro, release a prisoner in the coming weeks, it might well be appropriate to produce a resolution to show our appreciation. In my opinion, we are playing the dictator’s game, albeit unintentionally, I realise. The regime is on its way out, and the large number of detentions is a sign that Fidel Castro has lost control of the situation. The time has come to give him a shove to help him on his way, proposing to this vile character – for he is truly vile – that he go into exile, so that the country can, at last, be governed by those fighting for democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality hundreds of people died in Cuban prisons in the early years of the revolution, and many more have been imprisoned or had their lives ruined for daring to speak the truth. Certainly the revolution has had achievements, but the economic, as well as the political, costs have been very high. The Cuban economy is bankrupt, not because of American sanctions, but because of communism. What is the advantage of good doctors if there are inadequate medical facilities and resources?</p>
<p class="contents">Fidel Castro has failed to understand that the world has changed, and few of us were prepared for the recent crackdown on 33 dissidents, the rushed secret trials and the outrageous call for the death penalty for a Christian Democratic leader.</p>

We certainly condemn them. Nonetheless, we feel it is wrong to take these events out of the current context within that country. It is unfair and often perverse to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba is the victim of aggression by the United States. This aggression has been condemned by the international community more times than any other. The blockade has recently acquired a new dimension in the context of President Bush’s foreign policy. The Cuban authorities could well be justified in anticipating the danger of a qualitative change in the aggression they have been subjected to. Given the philosophy of pre-emptive wars which is now the official doctrine of the White House, a military invasion could take place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore understandable that the Cuban Government and of course a large part of the Cuban population should respond with defence mechanisms appropriate to a war situation. We are not surprised these responses are sometimes disproportionate or unjust. We are however saddened by them.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be difficult to convince Cubans that they are not justified in acting as they do. The virtual state of war Cuba has been in for years has suddenly become all too real. It is every bit as real as the Iraq war. It will be even more difficult to convince Cubans to change if the increasing provocation instigated by Mr Cason, who is in charge of the interests of the United States in Cuba, is not condemned whilst Cubans are criticised. Piracy and terrorism must be condemned too. I refer to the recent hijacking of two aircraft and a passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider ourselves friends of the Cuban people. We understand them and are in solidarity with them. We therefore feel we are in a position to appeal to them for moderation and generosity. At the same time we would denounce the situation outlined earlier, and commit the European Union to developing cooperation with Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the resolution before us, I agree in general with the little it does say. Nonetheless, I disagree with all it does not say. I also believe it contains serious untruths. These detract from its credibility. For instance, there are statements concerning requests for the death penalty. In my view, this is a text ridden with errors and omissions. It is unbalanced and therefore not useful. These are the reasons why I shall not vote in its favour, Mr President.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union has made a declaration strongly condemning those measures. That was followed by a <span class="italic">démarche</span> of the troika in Havana on 26 March 2003 in which the Commission participated.</p>
<p class="contents">The grave concern which was felt was highlighted in the European Union’s statement on human rights in the world at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last week. The statement called for the prompt release of those whom the Union considers to be prisoners of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation is and will remain an important aspect of our relationship with Cuba. The European Commission believes that a policy of dialogue is the most effective way to help bring about a positive evolution in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to facilitate a peaceful transition, the European Union follows, under the common position, a policy of 'constructive engagement' with Cuba. The EU common position distances itself from the use of coercive measures which might increase the hardship of the people of Cuba. Instead, it gives priority to a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society. In a nutshell: the European Union is of the firm conviction that a policy of constructive dialogue has more chance of success than one of isolation and embargoes.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cuba’s request for accession to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, that could provide a good framework to continue and deepen a meaningful dialogue with the Cuban authorities, in particular in the field of human rights. Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are essential elements of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore preparing a communication on that subject, in which it will present a full assessment of the situation, including an assessment of the most propitious timing for Cuban accession to the Cotonou Agreement. This is my response on behalf of the Commission, and, in particular, of my colleague Mr Nielson. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the grave concern which the Commission feels was highlighted in the European Union statement on human rights in the world at the United Nations meeting in Geneva last week. That statement calls for the prompt release of those whom the European Union considers to be prisoners of opinion. It goes without saying that a prompt release excludes the death penalty or any other kind of penalty. That is feeling of the Commission and Mr Nielson, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that Commissioner Bolkestein is not the commissioner responsible for this dossier and I do not, therefore, expect him to give me a definitive answer. I wish to ask the Commissioner to convey to the Commission and to Commissioner Nielson, in particular, my, indeed our, deep surprise at the explanation that we have been given here. We are familiar with the policy that had just been drawn up for Cuba. We are familiar with the policy and our attitude towards Cuba was one of goodwill. But the dictator Fidel Castro has betrayed this! He has actually changed the situation and this policy must therefore be changed. We cannot continue to pursue a policy as if the facts remained the same when they have suddenly changed. Commissioner Nielson must come before Parliament at his earliest convenience to give an answer on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will tell him that Parliament takes a very serious view of what is happening in Cuba. However, may I repeat, my colleague, and the Commission as a whole, shares those views.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point at issue at the moment appears to be the matter of the participation of Cuba in the Cotonou Agreement. Mr van den Bos referred to that possibility and asked whether its participation in the Cotonou Agreement would be possible should serious infringements of human rights in Cuba continue. As far as the Commission is concerned, it would be difficult to square participation in the Cotonou Agreement with a continuation of the present situation in Cuba. Therefore, I agree with Mr van den Bos that those two situations are difficult to reconcile. However, once again, I should like to be allowed sufficient time to hold further discussions with my colleague, Mr Nielson, in order to give a more definite reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know how the European Parliament and the European Union interpret human rights from Yugoslavia and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">They cite them to achieve political objectives, as is abundantly clear from the resolution on Cuba, the purpose of which is to slander the socialist system of the country, which has given its people the highest standard of living in Latin America. The motion abides by the ‘common position’ of the European Union, which makes cooperation with Cuba dependent on changes to the country's political system. At the same time, the European Parliament turns a blind eye to decades of subversive activity by the USA and the criminal embargo. It also denies the Cuban people the right to defend their revolution, while openly defending foreign agents and criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn the hypocrisy of the European imperialists and their partners but we understand their concern. Socialist Cuba is a thorn in their side. However, we cannot but condemn certain ‘lefties’ who have no hesitation in joining forces with the reactionaries, so that they do not appear to be lagging behind in supposedly defending human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
