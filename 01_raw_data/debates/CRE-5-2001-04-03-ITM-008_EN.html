<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, Members of Parliament, I am pleased to update you further on the current outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. To date, the outbreak remains largely confined to the UK, where almost 99% of cases recorded so far have occurred. The outbreak started with two cases detected on 20 February. Over the following weeks, however, the number of cases rose exponentially with daily totals sometimes 50 or more in number. As we speak, the total number of cases in the UK stands at over 900.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the other affected Member States is fortunately not as serious. There have been two cases in France, twelve in the Netherlands and one case in Ireland; however, we need to maintain a very high level of vigilance. All Member States are putting huge resources into combating the current outbreak. This is especially the case in the Member States which have recorded cases, and in the UK in particular. There has been a very high level of solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the current difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's strategy towards the crisis has been to act decisively and quickly. Our aim is to assist the Member States to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease. There is a consensus on this objective. Other considerations – very important considerations – arising from the crisis will have to wait until this objective has been achieved. We are maintaining a very high level of coordination and cooperation with the Member States: for example, there have been eight meetings of the Standing Veterinary Committee since the crisis broke; a ninth meeting is taking place in Brussels as we speak; and two further specialist meetings of laboratory experts on foot-and-mouth disease and on zoo animals have also taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also innumerable daily contacts and information exchanges with and between the Member States. We are acting urgently on all new information. For example, the Commission has acted to impose restrictions on exports and animal movements from affected Member States and regions within 24 hours of confirmed outbreaks. There have been no fewer than 18 decisions adopted by the Commission since the outbreak of this crisis. We are acting with as much transparency as possible. In addition to the meetings of the SVC, the crisis has been discussed twice in the agriculture council and five times in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in the European Council, in COPA or with professional organisations, and in countless press conferences and technical briefings. This is my third appearance in Parliament to update you on developments. I have also asked my officials to be available at all times to keep you informed on the progress of the outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Where possible, we are adopting a regionalised approach to any new outbreaks. This is designed to allow trade to continue, with however very severe safeguards to prevent further spread of the disease. The Commission has worked hard to convince third countries that exports from the Community are safe and are not a risk. I met the new US Secretary for Agriculture, Ann Veneman, last week in Washington, and she has undertaken to regularly review the situation. Our efforts are continuing to secure recognition for this regionalised approach by major export markets like Japan. I remain satisfied that the protective measures in place are sufficient to safeguard against the export of the virus to third countries. I repeat my call on them to lift unnecessary and unjustified restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the full range of Community measures in place. As I noted earlier, there are no fewer than 18 decisions adopted by the Commission to date and there will, no doubt, be more. They fall into two broad categories: first, measures with Community-wide effect; and second, measures which are specific to individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On to the first category, Community-wide measures excluding the UK, there are still very important restrictions on movements of live and susceptible animals. Essentially, with a few exceptions, movements are only possible from a holding to an abattoir, or to another holding with permission. In both cases, movements have to be authorised by the competent authorities of the place of departure and of destination. This has proven essential to avoid the possible further spread of the disease on the continent. Another essential measure was the obligation to slaughter all sheep imported from the UK between 1 February and 21 February. This has been proven by the epidemiology of the French outbreak two weeks later, as of 13 March, as the most crucial decision to avoid further spread on the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also important safeguards to ensure that any such transports do not allow animals to come into contact with animals from other holdings except for direct slaughter. Vehicles are cleaned and disinfected, adequate notice of movements of animals is given; movements of susceptible animals into the holding of dispatch within the previous 30 days have not taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is now a suspension in place on staging posts, while the maximum transport time is maintained. These points are designed to provide facilities for the resting, watering and feeding of live animals in transport; however, they are also an opportunity for animals to be cross-contaminated by other animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to Community measures in relation to individual Member States. In relation to the UK, there is a total ban on exports of susceptible live animals, untreated meat and meat products. However, Northern Ireland will be excluded from this measure with effect from today with two important exceptions. There will be no exports of live susceptible animals, and there will be no change in the current restrictions in the area of Newry and Mourne where Northern Ireland's only case of foot-and-mouth disease was detected almost five weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to France, the Netherlands and Ireland, there is a ban on the export of live susceptible animals. There is also a ban on the export of untreated meat and meat products, milk and milk products from the affected regions in Ireland (one county), in the Netherlands (four provinces), and in France (three <span class="italic">départements</span>). These restrictions are adapted as circumstances change. Hence in France for example, the ban on exports of live susceptible animals will remain in force until 12 April. However, the restrictions on exports of untreated meat and meat products will only apply to the three <span class="italic">départements</span> where the second case was detected on 23 March, as of today and following detailed investigations of the epidemiological situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing restrictions in relation to Ireland remain in place until 19 April. In the Netherlands, where there have been a total of 12 cases since the first case was detected on 21 March, the situation will be reviewed in the SVC today and tomorrow. In both of these Member States, the restrictions on products are confined to the regions where the cases have been detected. That summarises the situation insofar as restrictions on exports and movements of animals are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to two other important measures adopted in recent days. These concern the Commission decision to approve vaccination in clearly defined circumstances in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. The decision in relation to the Netherlands provides for suppressive vaccination.</p>
<p class="contents">This involves the vaccination of animals pending their pre-emptive killing and destruction to prevent the further spread of the virus. It has a role to play where there is insufficient capacity to carry out this killing and slaughter with the speed necessary to prevent the further spread of the disease. The Netherlands is in this unfortunate position and the Commission and the Member States in the SVC are sympathetic to the situation. Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate to allow vaccination to take place in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision in relation to the United Kingdom is more complex. It is confined to cattle only in the counties of Cumbria and Devon. Other species would not be vaccinated but pre-emptively killed in a certain radius around infected premises. In contrast with the present policy in the Netherlands, the vaccinated bovines would not necessarily be killed and destroyed. However, there would be very strict restrictions on the movements of these bovine animals, by and large dairy cows, which would effectively confine them to the regions concerned. There would also be important restrictions on the movement of their milk and milk products and, when eventually slaughtered, of meat and meat products from these animals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a measure of the consequences of vaccination that the UK has not yet decided if it will avail itself of the Commission decision in the circumstances in which it has been requested. The Netherlands for its part is considering a request for a revised scheme similar to that approved in the UK. As we speak, the Standing Veterinary Committee is discussing that particular request.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully appreciate that vaccination is a very emotive subject. It certainly appears as an attractive alternative to killing and destroying animals. But the reality is far different. This reality is that there are important limitations to vaccination and there is still no widespread support for such a policy. Generalised vaccination has not been asked for by the Member States, including the Netherlands and the UK. It has not been asked for by the European Council which discussed the crisis in Stockholm recently. And it has not been asked for by the farming community at large, nor have I heard any demands for its introduction in this, my third appearance, in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that it is a complex issue with formidable challenges. I have spoken to you before of some of these challenges. Let me now repeat them. There is no approved test to distinguish individually vaccinated animals from infected animals. This allows the disease to continue to persist in the animal population. There are seven serotypes of FMD, each with several sub-strains. Vaccination is only effective against the targeted strain and for a limited period only. As the disease is not endemic in the EU, the selection of the appropriate vaccine strain would be a pure lottery. There are over 300 million susceptible livestock – cattle, sheep and pigs – in the EU which would need to be vaccinated to give full coverage and it would jeopardise our trade between the Member States and with certain countries which insist on imports only from FMD-free countries which do not vaccinate. In the light of these circumstances, there is still a consensus that eradication of the present outbreak without the use of generalised vaccination is the best course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding I intend that, when this outbreak has been eradicated, we will carry out a very thorough examination of all the contributory factors to the current outbreak and the consequences. These will include issues such as the following which fall within my own area of responsibility: weaknesses in traceability of animals, especially of sheep and pigs; animal transport and especially measures which allow live animals from different Member States to cross-contaminate one another; vaccination and whether there needs to be a departure from the current policy of 'no' to generalised vaccination and, if so, in what circumstances and in what conditions; sanitary controls on imports, bearing in mind that the existing EU provisions are adequate if respected, not only to keep out the virus but also to ensure public health requirements are fully and properly respected.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are other wider issues which will also need to be considered. Costs: the present outbreak already has a full potential cost to the Community budget of up to EUR 170 million on disease eradication measures alone. Research into new marker vaccines and discriminatory tests which will allow vaccinated animals to be easily distinguished from infected animals thus giving much greater scope for protective vaccination. There has already been good progress in this area and it needs to be intensified. Further discussions in the relevant international bodies, especially in the OIE on the current approach towards the virus and perhaps, most importantly of all the issues raised, our current systems of animal production and their interaction with the non-farming rural community which has suffered hugely in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these issues can only be addressed when the current crisis has been brought under control. I hope that this will take place sooner rather than later. Thank you for your attention and I now look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This might be a first step, but in my own opinion, and that of my group, it is probably not sufficient. After all, we cannot deny that the current line of attack with regard to foot-and-mouth disease is unacceptable in real terms, and also from an economic, social and ethical point of view. The disease is continuing to rage out of control in Great Britain, which is leading to huge mass graves and enormous losses. In the Netherlands, twelve cases in a limited area have now led to the slaughter of almost 100 000 animals. In addition, social life has been disrupted to some extent over a large area, and other sectors, such as the medium-sized and small businesses, are suffering huge losses too. In my own country, we are now talking in terms of more than EUR 100 million. This also applies to the rural areas which are far removed from the affected area. For that reason, one could claim that the remedy, namely control by means of destruction, is worse than the disease itself. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions. Why are the Commission and Council not drawing from experience in South Africa and Argentina, among other countries, where outbreaks were successfully brought under control by means of comprehensive vaccination schemes? Why is the Commission not putting the report published in 1999 on the testing of vaccinated animals to good use?</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the enormity of the economic impact outside agriculture has become apparent, and there is – with good reason – widespread dissatisfaction among the public, who refuse to accept animal suffering, what is the Commission intending to do about this in the light of a thorough overhaul of the present non-vaccination policy? Does the Commission really condone the fact that for each animal infected with foot-and-mouth, tens of thousands of other, often still healthy, animals are being killed and destroyed? My question also falls within the scope of fighting BSE, for it is a well-known fact that we have a surplus of beef and veal. I would like the Commission to confirm, in plain language, that this approach of the foot-and-mouth outbreak is not related in any way to the BSE policy, where it is taken for granted that animals have to be removed from the farms and destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on this basis, I believe I have to conclude that the current policy of controlling foot-and-mouth can, both ethically and economically, no longer be justified, and I eagerly await your answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There was complete agreement that slaughter and containment was the most effective policy when this disease broke out. But for the rapid action of the United Kingdom Government to ban exports and impose movement restrictions and alert other Member States, the impact on the Continent and in Britain would have been far greater. Sound-bite television has not been helpful to public understanding of this complicated disease – as you may have experienced a few moments ago, Commissioner. Vaccination is not as simple as some suggest. I congratulate the Commissioner for making that clear and destroying some of the myths that have been bandied about. The Standing Committee has only agreed to vaccination with the proviso that quarantine, slaughter and disposal remain the most effective means of eradicating the disease. That clear message should go out from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no threat to human health. The vast majority of Britain's countryside is disease-free and open for business, subject to sensible precautions about staying away from farm land and farm animals.</p>
<p class="contents">This outbreak will continue for some time and must, as the Commissioner said, be followed by a full inquiry. There is little doubt that the virulence of the virus and the extensive sheep movements just before the outbreak have been important factors in the spread of the disease. But we need to know more about the incubation period, the epidemiology of the virus and how farming practices have been contributing factors. I welcome the commitment of the Commissioner to look at all these and other factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Pontificating on instant solutions in advance of an inquiry will not be helpful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my sympathy to the farming families affected by this, and also to other people who are suffering the effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberal group is backing the policy of emergency vaccinations to restrict the outbreak and spread of the virus. We are of the opinion that, ultimately, this will need to lead to complete eradication of the foot-and-mouth virus throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot turn a blind eye to the major doubts which pervade Europe with regard to the non-vaccination policy. What the Commissioner stated this afternoon can be applauded, but the message must be made clearer to the public. What would the implications be if we were to abandon the current policy? What are the effects on markets in Europe? What would be the implications on the income of the farming families if we were to abandon this policy? This message must be driven home.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to draw your attention to another aspect. At the moment, we are exercising extremely strict control at airports and other entry points. This should not be a temporary but permanent measure. We must follow the lead of the United States and Australia, where such controls have been in place for years. The Commissioner talked about the transport policy in Europe. We must consider whether we cannot set up certain quarantine zones throughout Europe, so that animals can no longer contaminate each other at the so-called resting points which are being used at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off on a minor point. Farmers have been unable to deliver milk for some days in various countries. Is it possible that the Commission could revise its decision to adjust their quota downwards? They must be given an extra milk quota, so that they are not suffering more damage than they already are. The days on which they were unable to deliver should be added to their quota. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have the impression that it comes rather too late. Perhaps these measures should have been adopted in "peace-time", if I can call it that. But the Commission – and some Member States as well – showed a striking lack of concern about the danger posed by the disease, and it would also seem that no one took the precaution of developing a common strategy to combat it. We had the impression that the politicians were falling over themselves with radical demands and instructions, but none of them offered a particularly effective response to the outbreaks.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, the key question now is: culling or vaccination? Let me make it clear to the House that it is not a matter of resuming a regular programme of preventive vaccinations. No, the question is whether the outbreak can now be contained through emergency "ring" and suppressive vaccinations. And what happens to the animals after they have been vaccinated? That is another question. You have authorised the vaccinations, but only on condition that the animals are slaughtered afterwards. You were rather circumspect in your speech today, so let's be frank about it: this is an absolute scandal. Healthy vaccinated animals do not need to be slaughtered to curb the epidemic, they can be returned to the economy. There are a number of countries which have proved that it is possible to pursue an export policy even though they have cases of foot-and-mouth disease at home. Argentina is a case in point, with its trade with the EU and other countries. But they do not export the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">What we expect from you – and I hope that tomorrow's resolution will bear this out – is that you will not present us with endless arguments about why the cull is necessary: I have heard quite enough of them from your subordinates. Endless imagination is used to justify the culling – yet in reality, very little imagination is needed to break away from this fixation with slaughter. I expect you to explain to us how you intend to negotiate at international level in order to enable us to achieve a sensible policy on how to combat the epidemic while continuing to trade with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must finally overcome this contradiction: the two things must be possible, trade and a sensible policy on the disease. Vaccination is not just an emotive issue ….</p>

I do not believe that we are out of the woods yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the first case of foot-and-mouth disease, the Commission has supported the slaughter of lambs and the blazing pyres, and has been reluctant to approve other methods of tackling the disease which might have been agreed at national level. In my view, this is a major political risk, as the costs and benefits are very difficult to quantify. Putting our money on the economy from the outset would have been the right approach. A vaccination programme at the very start of the foot-and-mouth outbreak would have saved a great deal of money, but above all, it would have saved a great deal of personal suffering. It is estimated that around 200 million livestock are moved around the EU every year. Traceability in this commercial chain, especially in the necessary chronological order, is always problematical and uncertain. Even in normal years – without BSE and foot-and-mouth crises – the error rates are high. The common agricultural policy has its own powerful momentum, and it is difficult to halt it once it is under way.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it would have been necessary to identify a number of viable and practical alternatives to the current strategy to combat FMD. The present approach is mediocre and irrational – so I am delighted that it is to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Beef consumption has decreased by 50 per cent. Prices have hit rock-bottom, and the monthly wages bill can no longer be covered from beef production. Commissioner Fischler's compensation programme is to be enhanced with an eighth point, namely the removal of the penalty bonus for the milk quota. This makes sense, as cattle sales have been stopped. Jobs and livelihoods in agriculture, food production and processing are at stake. There is no longer any rural tourism, even in areas which are free of FMD. Even relatives are staying at home. Patching this up through a "rural renewal" programme could take years. After all, cattle cannot be produced overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Vaccination must be utilised more effectively throughout Europe as a normal instrument to combat the disease. It must be ensured, in this context, that vaccinated animals and their products are commercially viable, in other words, that they can be marketed without any trade barriers. Discriminatory tests must be developed as a matter of urgency in order to allow vaccinated animals to be easily distinguished from infected stock. This should also make it easier for the Commission to give the Member States more scope than before to have their say in decisions on measures to prevent and eradicate the disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the situation that has been described to us. I therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient. Moreover, we have heard, in the Committee on Agriculture and elsewhere, that, also in the United Kingdom – as some farmers have said – interventions are not always timely enough considering the fact that as long as three weeks have been known to pass between the occurrence of a case of foot-and-mouth disease on a farm and slaughter of the animal. We must therefore create the right conditions for the Commission to intervene through all the channels open to it and ensure that timely measures are taken, apart from anything else in order to make the need for vaccination clear at last. Although vaccination will not provide a definitive solution to the problem, it will certainly be an indication of the will to stop regarding slaughter as the only possible reaction. There is therefore a clear need to create the right conditions for tighter controls and thus to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from spreading to other countries as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They often have the finger pointed at them, but farmers are, in fact, victims of the system. Mass slaughter, carried out in the name of the much-vaunted precautionary principle, is becoming much less acceptable, especially because consumer confidence has not returned as a result of this sacrifice. Confidence cannot be bought by decree – it has to be earned. An appropriate media campaign should be launched to restore this confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Our exports are paralysed by poorly targeted embargoes. The Commission failed in its negotiations with the United States. Only a few regions are affected by foot-and-mouth disease, but the whole of Europe is being punished – this is an unacceptable situation that must be redressed. The Russian and Japanese markets are also out of bounds. What did the negotiations achieve?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must adopt a strong position on regional policy. With this background of economic and social disaster, why is preventative vaccination not being carried out, instead of resorting to a pre-emptive cull? Systematic culling causes both the ruin of the farmers involved and the destruction of genetic heritage. Europe has a wealth of local breeds authorising their vaccination will enable us to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to compensation, this must be paid to enable farmers to buy new livestock, and payments must be made quickly, since administrative red tape would be unacceptable in this crisis. Compensation must also be paid out to those working in farming-related activities and other rural businesses, such as poultry and game farming and the many tourist activities. Although the tourist industry is not affected by the disease, it has lost revenue due to the prevailing hysteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, psychological counselling facilities should be set up as soon as possible. Apart from the financial aspects, who at the present time is concerned about the distress experienced by farmers who have had part of their heritage destroyed? We must show unwavering solidarity in the light of this human tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foot-and-mouth disease has arrived just in time for eastward enlargement and for the WTO negotiations. First of all, it is in time for eastward enlargement, since we must, of course, cut our agricultural expenditure because the annual budgetary pie for agriculture will have to be cut into 21 slices instead of 15 and everyone’s piece will, therefore, be smaller unless the number of farmers is reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">And it has arrived just in time for the WTO negotiations, since we must make room in our marketplace for goods from the southern hemisphere, for goods from the Cairns Group as we already have for wine, fruit and vegetables – but there is also New Zealand and Australia, which, as if by chance, produce lamb. So, how can we now cut agricultural expenditure for Western Europe and make room in our marketplace for goods from the South? Quite simply by cutting our numbers of farmers and livestock. And how can we cut our numbers of farmers and livestock? Quite simply by making a drama of an everyday occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease, blowing it out of all proportion subjecting it to <span class="italic">Apocalypse Now</span>-type media treatment, turning it into a spectacle, with butchers, mass graves, diggers, bulldozers, cordons sanitaire, the armed forces and mountains of burning sheep, cattle and pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">For months now, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has been warning of foot-and-mouth disease prevalent in Anatolia, Korea, Japan, in South Africa itself and in Greece last year. The world is on red alert and yet the European Union does not flinch. Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out, and it breaks out, as luck would have it, in Great Britain, which has the most livestock in Europe. What we should do is vaccinate. So, what do we do? We do not vaccinate. And we do not vaccinate firstly because we have to come through this unscathed and vaccination would involve three million pigs, sheep and cows, secondly because this would cost EUR 100 million, and finally because we could no longer export anything even though we are not exporting anything at all. And so the disease spreads further.</p>
<p class="contents">And what is the outcome of all this? Farmers aged 55 and over, whose herds have been slaughtered, are forced into retirement. Farmers who suffer unavoidable financial problems due to a fall in sales go out of business. But then, although farmers leave farming, the budget savings that we need can be achieved. Although British herds are haemorrhaging, there is room in the marketplace for lamb from the southern hemisphere and then New Zealand and Australia will, as a result, agree to sign up at the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Eastward enlargement can go ahead, since, in terms of the budget, agricultural expenditure has been slashed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake of the BSE crisis, foot-and-mouth disease has given rise to a total of three miracles. The first miracle is that there are fewer budgetary obstacles standing in the path of eastward enlargement. The second miracle is that the Cairns Group is satisfied with the sacrifice of European livestock and is happy to sign up to the WTO. The third miracle is that we can also reform the CAP at the expense of our farmers, who are made out by the media to be poisoning cows and infecting sheep.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this happened by chance, of course. It was also by chance that Stephen Dorrell admitted in 1996 that BSE could be passed on to humans, at the exact time when there was the scandal of US hormone-treated beef. It is by chance that we have allowed the disease to spread. It is by chance that, for ten years, we have done nothing to combat BSE. It is by chance that the United States has a stranglehold over the world’s media. So, Mr President, you must appoint Mr Chance European Commissioner alongside Mr Pascal Lamy. Having given up on soya at the Blair House negotiations, he will be successful at the WTO negotiations and next on the list will be the farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the urgent steps that must be taken in order to combat this disease, in this situation which is extremely difficult to control, since vaccination was stopped in the European Union in 1991, and, on the other hand, the subsequent measures to be taken once the disease is under control, so that a disaster of this kind can never happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">What will need to be done? First of all, we need to initiate an in-depth discussion of the developments in farming which have allowed such diseases to occur. Were we right to allow such intensive farming to take place and become increasingly widespread and specialised, employing processes that were increasingly artificial? Were we right to have so few abattoirs, which caused local abattoirs to close down, and which encouraged intensive farming and made it necessary to systematically transport animals over long distances?</p>
<p class="contents">We will then have to thoroughly re-examine the international rules laid down by the World Organisation for Animal Health which, in their current state, seem absurd and obsolete. Currently, if a living animal is vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease within a particular country, that country will lose its status as a foot-and-mouth-free country, and is therefore banned from exporting. Who cannot see that this arbitrary rule blatantly favours the United States?</p>
<p class="contents">We must also deal with bilateral trade exchanges, as each country can freely negotiate the conditions governing exports with Russia, Japan or other countries. We must also take a regionalist approach. There is no reason why any Member State, even the whole of the European Union, should be considered as a homogenous entity in this area. There is no reason why a case of foot-and-mouth in Brittany should affect Alsace, nor why a country that has 1 000 cases of infection such as Great Britain and a country that has two cases such as France should be treated in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we will have to give serious thought to whether it was the right decision to ban a preventative vaccination that has been used in the Community since 1991. Should we not at least authorise the vaccination of rare animals, reproductive animals, and even milk herds? To enable this to be done, it is imperative that we encourage research and development into marker vaccines which enable a vaccinated animal to be distinguished from an infected animal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will have to find the resources required to encourage holdings, especially small and medium-sized holdings where rearing and fattening are carried out in the same place, which reduces the risks of spreading diseases since integrating birth, rearing and slaughter at the same holding is a vital factor in preventing the spread of disease. This role must be fully acknowledged under the common policy.</p>

I would also like to add that vaccination must not be used to cover up poor hygiene and disease prevention. But it is also quite clear now that the first real test of the strength of the new FMD policy since the introduction of the internal market is about to end in disaster. However, let me add a further point in all seriousness, Commissioner: international agreements – restrictions, even self-imposed restrictions through the IOE criteria – mean that no one in Europe, neither the Commission nor the other European institutions, can bear to continue the current policy. The endless culling of herds is neither intelligent nor appropriate in the long term. Indeed, it raises a number of issues concerning animal welfare, guaranteed property rights, and even the principle of proportionality, which is part of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. So I welcome the fact that those affected are starting to clarify these issues at the highest judicial level.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do we proceed with a new strategy which will not find it easy to dispense with tried and tested methods of disease prevention? This automatically raises a further question: what has the Commission done to implement the report by the Scientific Committee in March 1999 as regards the regionalisation negotiations at international level, the validation of testing, and the evaluation of the criteria determining when emergency vaccinations are necessary in "at risk" regions too?</p>
<p class="contents">A last word: the general abhorrence of vaccinations, both on a Europe- and worldwide level, must end. And we will push for this with all our energy and determination.</p>

<p class="contents">I would today like to express our general feeling of relief that we have on a local level managed to contain the infection and that we are able to announce that the situation is under control with regard to the second holding in France where foot-and-mouth was discovered and treated, approximately 300 kilometres from the first site.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there have only been these two outbreaks in France, we can, of course, deduce from this that the Community strategy to combat the foot-and-mouth virus is effective and very suitable since it is implemented in a most vigilant and strict manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite our pleasure in having won the first battle, I do not think, however, that we can draw any firm conclusions. I would also like to stress that we will have to wait for the disease to be completely eradicated before we can accurately weigh up its impact in terms of health, the economy, as well as its psychological and budgetary impact. However, before we reach that stage, I would like to mention the problems that we need to deal with now.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers have fulfilled their role as a shield, with their herds being sacrificed in order to protect the community at large. The European and national community must now treat the farmers’ psychological suffering and ensure that their economic losses are totally compensated. The industry is destabilised and under threat. Member States and the European Union must deal with this situation as a matter of urgency and in a way that matches people’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions, the general public has said that it does not understand the mass slaughter of animals when the virus poses no danger to humans. A specific statement should, therefore, be issued in order to clarify the health and economic issues of this disease for the benefit of citizens and on the possible direction of our health strategy, moving towards the use of technology to carry out vaccinations, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this is an exceptional situation. We must deal with it in an exceptional manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope it is. We therefore have to look to the future. Animal diseases spread with animal transportation, and so for this reason animal transport across borders should generally be avoided. At least there should not be any kind of financial incentive for it. Moreover, animal transportation must be properly monitored in each EU Member State and candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem concerns animal auctions, especially those involving bull calves. I think these should be abolished altogether. Animal sales should be carried out, in this age of modern technology, directly between one farm and another, or between farm and abattoir. I would also like to stress the importance of a policy of prevention. Strict adherence to legal provisions on hygiene and transport is the undisputed basis for all agricultural trade and, consequently, for the production chain. The EU should embark on an eventual vaccination programme so that countries free of infection and disease do not have to unduly suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The consequential loss to those directly and indirectly affected by the disease has so far been enormous: hauliers, abattoirs, tourism, cultural events, schools and the small business sector are all bearing the brunt. Farmers whose stock is not affected directly by FMD, but who are unable to move their stock to markets, are also facing massive losses, further exacerbated by the ban on the sale of cattle over 30 months following the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I learnt from one of my colleagues last week that if the UK were to offer state aid to those affected by the crisis, this would not contravene European Union competition policy. I would appreciate clarification by the Commission on this point. We must also call again for the re-establishment of local abattoirs and a reduction in animal transport over long distances, which undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for the rapid spread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because of the EU multinational companies’ demand for complete freedom to move goods within the Community, a demand which has been met by establishing the single internal market. The border veterinary and sanitary controls required in order to move animals and animal products between the countries of the European Union have been abolished within this market. As a result, diseases are easily transmitted and it is difficult, if not impossible, to stop diseases moving from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the certificates testifying to the state of health of the animals and animal products being transported are a symbolic rather than a substantive measure – witness the unacceptable impression created by veterinary services nowadays which do not have even the most rudimentary structure needed in order to cope with the increasing demands, both quantitative and qualitative, of the internal market. This is the natural consequence of the multinationals’ demand that all obstacles be removed and that controls, which are basically left to the companies themselves, be minimised, as we have seen from other recent problems such as dioxin, BSE etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation is therefore the price we have to pay for creating a internal market and bowing to the demand for fewer and fewer controls. It merely proves that we need to reinstate border controls at internal frontiers in order to prevent the emergence and spread of epizootic diseases and to compensate livestock farmers for their losses. Any such compensation should not be linked to cuts in Community funding for other agricultural products, especially from countries which have no part in the causes or dimensions of the current problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the meantime, I have not altered my view other than to say, regretfully, that the dreaded virus has since spread to my country with devastating consequences for farmers within the control zone of Cooley Peninsula, and with worrying implications for Ireland's farming and rural communities.</p>
<p class="contents">With such a dreaded virus one is somewhat reluctant to talk about success, other than to say thankfully Ireland's quick response, sometimes regarded as extreme, has so far been successful in containing the disease to one outbreak. But Ireland is paying an enormous price for this single incident. It affects not just the farmers but the broader economy such as tourism and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am left with some questions about the effectiveness of the controls up to the point of the outbreak of the first disease. It is obvious that Britain's first outbreak originated outside the Community, and I now question whether third countries which export to us are complying with the conditions we have imposed. This is something on which the EU Food and Veterinary Office must focus in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must question whether the meat being imported into the European Union is being fraudulently misrepresented on importation. Are the inspection procedures and sampling arrangements at import points into the Union adequate? I ask the Commissioner today, who has been doing an extremely good job, to consider increasing the level of sampling as an initial step.</p>
<p class="contents">In my contribution last month I called for an EU taskforce to police the implementation of the control measures in Member States. I ask today are we satisfied that enough is being done? What about the method of disposal – have we reached any scientific conclusions about the necessity for incineration as against the safe burial of dead animals? Do we have a view on the psychological impact, not just on farmers, but on the entire EU population, young and old, of the non-stop display on our television screens of truckloads of dead and decomposing animals?</p>

Emergency vaccination is now taking place in a radius around that farm, and 90 000 animals will be slaughtered in the next few weeks. This is a disaster of unknown proportions which is affecting 200 farming families, as well as many others, in this village. Given the permission for emergency vaccination, I had hoped that the Commission would have begun to appreciate the ethical side of agriculture. But emergency vaccination is only putting off the evil hour for healthy animals. This level of destruction is not acceptable, and there are alternatives available, such as those included in our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Cows, sheep and pigs are more than production units. They are God’s creatures in relation to which we need to act as responsible stewards. The measures which the Commission is taking are based only on dubious economic motives, that is to say retaining remote export markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-vaccination policy was based on a restricted outbreak every 5 to 10 years. The present epidemic is anything but restricted. The non-vaccination policy is therefore based on false scenarios and must be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to consider the ethical dimension of its policy. Healthy, vaccinated animals could be kept for the internal market.</p>

In Cumbria, where the outbreak was spreading out of control, we told the farmers that they would have to slaughter even healthy animals in a preventative cull. They reluctantly agreed to comply with that request and the slaughter of healthy animals has begun. Now we appear to be changing direction and saying at a time when we have not enough veterinary resources to deal with the backlog of animals requiring slaughter, with the huge backlog of animals requiring disposal burial, we are saying now that we wish to diversify and use these vets for a mass vaccination policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of dithering has been an element which has been obvious throughout this whole disease. To say that the UK government has been decisive is a nonsense: it dithered over whether to bring in the army. It dithered whether to use incineration instead of burial. Now it is dithering over vaccination. Let me say this afternoon that vaccination is not the right way forward. After what Mr Byrne has told us, if we use the vaccination policy we effectively bring down the curtain on our agricultural economy. We would close off the export trade for all these products from animals in the areas where vaccination had been used.</p>
<p class="contents">Vaccination is not a sensible way forward just now during the epidemic. We know that in Saudi Arabia they have used the vaccination policy for the last two years. They have nevertheless had six outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. We know that when you vaccinate cattle it can take up to 14 days before they develop immunity. In the case of pigs it can take 7 days. During that time they can spread the virus. I would pose one question to Mr Byrne before I finish. He was talking about whole areas of Holland, France and Ireland where restrictions will be lifted. Will similar restrictions be lifted in areas of the United Kingdom not affected by the disease? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I take an entirely different view. I am convinced that if you do not start talking about tomorrow and the future now, while all the Member States are trembling at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, you will find that once everything has settled down, the Member States will all sit back and relax. So now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time, for example, to work actively with your colleague Mr Fischler to ensure that a follow-up system for sheep and pigs is introduced immediately, so that the premium payments are no longer coupled to specific transfer date provisions. It would no longer be necessary to move the sheep and pigs all round the European Union to ensure they can be counted at the right place at the right time when the money is available.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also believe that you must finally take courage and throw a stone into the water. Why do you not say: live transports are banned? Every live transport must be granted an exemption. Why can animals not be transported after slaughter? Try it and see. Why do you not announce here and now that we need a different policy on disease? Sit down with the IOE in Paris and say: the international policy on animal diseases needs to be changed right away, together with all the other relevant partners in the IOE.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally: tell us, what have you got against giraffes? Many people have asked me that question: what has the Commissioner got against giraffes? Why is he stopping the safari parks from vaccinating to prevent disease? Why is he making all the safari parks close down, or putting the fear of whatever disease into the zoos throughout the European Union, because we failed to pursue a decent disease prevention policy and all the animals suddenly have to be culled? So tell us, Mr Byrne: please tell us, what have you got against giraffes? Please be so kind, take the measures today. Be more courageous today, do not wait until tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to make three brief points. Firstly, the animal health policy adopted by the European Union during the 1990s appears to have been a good one. What we are witnessing during these initial months of 2001 is a quite extraordinary phenomenon, but one which requires careful analysis. We thought that foot-and-mouth disease was a minor problem, but the response from all over the world is forcing us to think again: there is a complex situation in Mongolia, specific situations in Africa and Argentina. This will probably mean the need for a rethink and the introduction of a World Trade Organisation regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector is, in any case, constantly the focus of traumatic events which are causing – I would say – a sharp, frightening drop in farmers' incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need flexible policies. There should be separate measures for foot-and-mouth issues relating to zoos and rare animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the battle against the virus, all means must be deployed. The European non-vaccination policy is now turning out to be a self-imposed handicap. I set great store by the fact that we should join forces in this time of crisis, and that we should adhere to a Europe-wide approach. However, the downside of the non-vaccination policy is also making itself felt now. I am quoting animal welfare in this connection. The destruction or evacuation of healthy animals is meeting with enormous resistance. I am also quoting animals in zoos. It is quite inexplicable that animals in zoos and at pasture in nature reserves are not allowed to be vaccinated. Furthermore, you are calling the effectiveness into question. The massive slaughter could not prevent foot-and-mouth from spreading across England. The draconian measures in the Netherlands could not prevent further outbreaks of the disease, or the spread of the virus into Germany. Commissioner, the situation is very serious indeed. We call for a joint approach. Hence, I would like to put two pressing questions to you.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, at what stage will you recognise that the European strategy has failed? I assume that you will not wait until all livestock has disappeared, but where will you draw the line? Secondly, is it conceivable that vaccinations can take place in a short space of time and on a limited scale in the dairy farms, where the identification and registration system can guarantee that meat and dairy products remain in the region and certainly outside the export loop?</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, we do not simply call for a return to a policy of preventive vaccination. Experts, however, do call for strategic vaccination in the event of an outbreak, obviously accompanied by failsafe registration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, today, I received 350 signatures from children who live in Amsterdam. They want the animals in their zoo, Artis, to be vaccinated. I should like to offer you these signatures, and I hope for a positive response to their request. I gave you the note that they enclosed a moment ago, and I hope that you will be able to spend a few minutes of your time on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is being asked for today in this House. A decision on vaccination is not easy. I understand that many farmers are reluctant to go down the route of vaccination but the effect of this outbreak is being felt not only by the farming community, but by hauliers, hoteliers and a whole host of tourist businesses who are suffering without compensation. The Commissioner told us the disease has cost EUR 170 million in eradication measures. It is costing far more in lost business. If science allows us to distinguish between animals which have been vaccinated and those carrying the disease, then vaccination should be allowed whenever requested.</p>
<p class="contents">The lessons from the UK are of inadequate contingency planning, an inadequate number of vets due to cuts in government services and inadequate supplies of labour and materials. I would ask the Commissioner three questions. Are you satisfied with the UK's response to this disease? Are you satisfied that other countries have adequate contingency plans? Would you confirm that the first you heard of this disease in the UK was indeed on 20 February or were your services in fact tipped off about a possible outbreak some weeks earlier? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The message to the UK Government was clear: to help prevent the slaughter of millions of healthy animals and to save farmers and the tourist industry from economic ruin, the government must urgently start a vaccinate-now firebreak campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, Europe's farming must become less dependent on international trade and more self-reliant. It is a nonsense that we simultaneously export and import precisely the same product to and from the same country and it is clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, animal welfare or the tourist industry that the UK Government has as its priority for protection, but simply our meat exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, you also talked of not vaccinating in order to safeguard trade; yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up. According to the National Farmers' Union, the UK earns just GBP 633 million per year from meat and dairy exports. Compare this with the estimated GBP 9 billion cost of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. We therefore urge the Commissioner to revise the EU strategy of defending, by all means, its FMD-free status, and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to ask Mr Byrne, firstly, to clarify the regional approach that he has taken, because I believe that we must protect this and immediately put it into place. Secondly, with regard to the outcome of the inquiries, I would like to say to the Commissioner and the Council that foot-and-mouth disease is one of the contagious diseases that is rife in the world; the entire population, one which is increasingly mobile which is natural since travel is becoming cheaper and cheaper will, increasingly, spread diseases that can be caught by both animals and humans. That is what this crisis of foot-and-mouth disease signifies.</p>
<p class="contents">Are you prepared, Commissioner to give some thought, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, to all these illnesses that we are going to suffer in the future as a result of this increasingly accessible Europe, in the light of the decisions taken regarding LDCs for 2006 and 2009, which will allow the free movement of all products, apart from weapons, throughout Europe. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to take steps, as the United States has done and I shall for once not make any openly anti-American remarks to establish much tighter controls in our airports, on all products that arrive from anywhere and everywhere in the world. Have you considered, in conjunction with the Council and Commission, any further steps to benefit the people who travel and who pass through our airports too? This really is a genuine appeal that I am making to the Commission, to Parliament and to the national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall sum up, Commissioner, by also saying that the European spirit which brings us here, to Parliament, forces us to ask the Council and Parliament to take exceptional measures for farmers and all sectors of the economy and the affected regions in Europe, otherwise, I believe that European integration is meaningless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You then present yourself to this Parliament as the master of an agriculture that is focused on intensive production and exports. In other words, you are saying ‘I cannot vaccinate livestock because if I did, I would harm exports’. This illogical approach is intolerable. You have to make a choice, Commissioner: either you are genuinely interested in protecting producers, in which case you have to opt for vaccination in areas with the highest numbers of affected animals, or you want to protect the export industry, in which case you would be sacrificing producers to exports. What you cannot do is address both issues in the same way. I would ask you, whose side are you actually on? Are you on the side of the export industry or of saving livestock farmers?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question to you concerns another incongruity: the Netherlands has discovered a dozen cases, and the United Kingdom 900. The United Kingdom has slaughtered hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of animals and the Netherlands has slaughtered a few thousand. The latter is using vaccination but with regard to the UK, on which everyone is focussing, and which has major problems, you come here, Commissioner, and sit on the fence. This is unacceptable. You must tell us what you think about vaccination. I should also like to ask you why animals are being slaughtered once they have been vaccinated. You must explain to us what the technical or scientific basis is for having animals slaughtered when they have already been vaccinated. I have one final question: your Veterinary Committee knows the type of vaccination needed and can guarantee its safety. Why then are you always confusing the situation and leading people to believe that from a technical and scientific point of view, we cannot control this disaster through vaccination? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Roth-Behrendt is right. We should do this today, and not tomorrow. I have read reports from virologists and vets who claim that, in this day and age, adopting a non-vaccination policy is much like sitting on a time bomb. Apparently, there are a number of diseases which we still do not have under control, such as swine fever, and now also foot-and-mouth disease, by all accounts. This is why we need to reconsider all the factors involved, including the human dimension. Surely you cannot tell farmers every couple of years: look, you have worked really hard, but there is now a threat of a disease and we will have to eradicate your businesses. Then there is the aspect of animal welfare. It appears that the scientific arguments are still not fully concluded. All economic arguments have to be looked at, for internal consumption takes a real nosedive each time we hit a crisis. Just add up all the costs of these crises combined. We only need to look at the internal market: pigs are now being sold in the Netherlands at BEF 50/kg, and at BEF 80/kg in Belgium. It is only a matter of time before the first reports on smuggling will start to roll in.</p>
<p class="contents">All these aspects should therefore be considered. After all, people, especially in my country, are increasingly mystified by your policy. You will therefore need to carefully explain what it is all about. You claim that no single country is asking for vaccination, but no single minister dares ask at this moment when a true European discussion will be held on this subject. The positions are shifting. When will we be able to hold a debate on this subject at the highest level? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it is hard to understand why the Union is finding it so difficult to react to this disease and to adopt a strategy to combat it. Starting with the Veterinary Committee, which only belatedly authorised vaccination, then the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which seemed more concerned with external trade issues than with controlling the situation, and finally, the Stockholm European Council, which danced around the crisis, like a ‘cat on a hot tin roof’, insisting on referring all the costs to the financial framework defined in Berlin. Secondly, the problems faced by some countries today in mobilising resources to deal with sick animals are clear for all to see. The European Union itself has never advocated a genuine common veterinary policy and in my own county we have seen a degree of laxness creeping into health policy, with unbelievable delays in payments to health protection agencies cofinanced by the European Union. Lastly, I wish to emphasise the urgency of adopting a decision on the strategy that we should follow. We know that it is not easy and that both vaccination and non-vaccination have their pros and cons. What is happening, though, is that the assessment carried out ten years ago which led to opting for non-vaccination must now be reconsidered in the light of the many aspects of European farming that have changed since then, starting with its integration into the global economy, which has increased the risks of contamination exponentially.</p>
<p class="contents">Selective preventive vaccination or vaccination within a <span class="italic">cordon sanitaire</span>, on a regional basis, should be seen as alternatives that the Member States can authorise, according to the number of cases they discover. Otherwise, we shall run the risk of losing control of a potential future outbreak of an even greater crisis, or of irreversibly damaging irreplaceable genetic heritage, as has happened, in some countries, with certain native breeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there were simple solutions to this tragedy, we would have found them by now. In the UK we gave our neighbours in France, Ireland and in the Netherlands an early warning and they acted promptly. We applaud them for what they did. But in a minefield the early warning is given by the first person to step on the mine and that was the UK. We have suffered greatly from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commissioner confirm that this is essentially a crisis of movement? Would he accept, as the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not, that vaccinated animals can carry the virus? Otherwise the belated decision which the Commission took on 14 March to exclude Argentine produce would make no sense. Will he undertake with the SVC to examine the problem of long-range, unrecorded animal movements in which animals are largely treated as commodities, which has been the major factor in the spread of FMD? Would a carcass trade not be better for Europe to be considering?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what is the SVC's opinion of the various methods of disposal used in the UK where a million animals have now been culled? Can he reject the false stories which have been put around by some in the UK that these methods were originally vetoed by the Commission, if that was not the case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the situation for everyone concerned is far too serious for us simply to be carrying on with politics as usual. Please do not misunderstand me: I certainly would not wish to prevent the dreadful situation of farmers and rural communities from being given the attention it deserves at European level, quite the contrary. But I am afraid that if this discussion is not addressed seriously, it will simply create even more uncertainty among our citizens. The tragedy faced by the farmers needs more than headlines. The survival of a profession is at stake. Although the farmers currently receive up to 30% less for their cattle, a kilo of beef costs just as much, if not more, than before. And this is the case even in my own Member State, which fortunately still has no cases of foot-and-mouth disease or BSE. The situation in the regions where there have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease is critical. It is not only the farmers who are affected; it has an impact on everyone in these rural areas, including tourism and thousands of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to the farmers and the rural communities who are suffering as a result of this disease. I hope that everyone understands what damage this is doing to farmers, and that years of work will be required to rebuild these herds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about vaccination policy: I support the emergency vaccination measures in order to prevent the virus from spreading. But we must not give people the impression that the animals are healthy as a result of vaccination, and that we do not need to cull them. I believe that we must continue to cull if we wish to regain our disease-free status.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the Commission, but above all the Member States, fulfil their responsibilities. I notice time and again that throughout the European Union, there are still no disinfectant mats at the airports. This hygiene problem is a matter of acceptance in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Republic of Ireland we have been fortunate so far in that the outbreak has been confined to one area close to the border with Northern Ireland. And while the disease has appeared in only four Member States, we cannot yet be sure that it will not spread further. In the light of this, we must make certain that the restrictions domestically imposed do not impact disproportionately to the detriment of other key industries and public life generally. The option, therefore, of vaccination has to be kept open in the interests of the wider community. I said this last month. I hope that this month, given the weight of opinion expressed here today, this will now be listened to.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Draconian restrictions on people's movements cannot continue. We cannot reasonably expect the farming community to have the balanced view of this issue that the wider community needs. It is for politicians to make these balanced choices. I am thinking, in particular, of the tourist industry in Ireland, which is worth EUR 4 billion. The Irish Hotels Federation is already reporting actual losses of EUR 55 million in the last month, with obvious knock-on consequences for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be made clear that the illegal movement of sheep by unscrupulous operators will not be tolerated. Such movements in border areas between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland must be stamped out and licenses withdrawn from those found to be involved in such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I want to support the call by my colleagues for a European taskforce, not only to monitor the existing situation, but whose remit would also be to monitor and approve a European-wide eradication programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Could this outbreak have been prevented? Will consumers lose confidence in our food? Are our rules and regulations concerning animal movement and animal traceability all that they should be? Are farmers' incomes such that they can afford to call out a vet when in doubt and have the European Commission and the national responses been adequate to the challenge? There will be more time for those later.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the complex question of vaccination, even if it is not on the Irish agenda. In the last 18 months, 34 countries have reported outbreaks. To maintain a disease-free status a country has to be free of FMD for at least 12 months, an effective system of surveillance must be in place and all regulatory measures for the prevention and control of FMD must have been implemented. A policy of strategic ring-vaccination around outbreaks may be appropriate in certain circumstances even though we still cannot distinguish commercially between infected and vaccinated animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that the Dutch, for example, have a particular problem about disposing of carcasses so vaccination is for them perhaps an option to ring-fence the disease. I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination. With the tragedy of FMD following on from BSE and swine fever we must review in a rational way the common agricultural policy. We know that FMD has been around for 400 years so modern farm practices cannot be blamed for this virulent disease, but the mobility of animals today gives rise to greater risk and faster contamination. The general principle should be to ensure that animals are slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production.</p>
<p class="contents">There are huge economic implications for Ireland from this disease and while farmers are suffering badly, because of restriction of movements and slaughtering, so are other businesses and industries, particularly our tourism and transport sectors. Already we have lost IRL 200 million in tourism receipts since the outbreak of FMD in the UK some weeks ago. Our overseas markets are seriously threatened and we have only one case of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are only spending 1% of the 1.2% of GDP currently available. There are other measures that can help compensate sectors generally in terms of our budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that against the background of enlargement, we will be forced to rethink the situation. Last week, 4000 animals were culled as a preventive measure in my region, after piglets had arrived there from quarantine areas in Holland.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2 p.m. today, foot-and-mouth disease may also have reached Germany and my home region of Münsterland near the Dutch border. If the cases are confirmed, Commissioner, the disease will have broken out in a region which is widely regarded as the "meat belt" of North Rhine-Westphalia. The EU's "no vaccination" policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries. So my question is this, Mr Byrne: is it not clear that this policy really has failed? What does Europe gain, in financial terms, from these exports, and what is the epidemic costing Europe? The Commission should put these figures on the table for the Council. I called for this two weeks ago in the Committee on Agriculture. Put the figures on the table, and do it quickly. Then the Council can decide, and the Council can take responsibility for its policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will undoubtedly set out its views on this issue in its resolution tomorrow. I am in favour of emergency ‘ring’ and suppressive vaccinations, and I say: let us do it right away. I believe that the current situation is putting untold emotional and psychological strain on farmers. What about Europe's moral responsibility for its policies? Please, Commissioner, answer the questions we have asked. Please do not just read your prepared text because otherwise this whole discussion will be a waste of time. Thank you.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I will try to answer all the questions you asked though, given the time I have, I am sure I am going to fail to some extent. If I do please forgive me for that.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you – indeed maybe everybody – spoke about vaccination and the case for there being a wider use of vaccination. Let me be very clear about this and repeat what I said earlier. The Commission does see a role for vaccination. I said this on a number of occasions when I was here before in Parliament and on other occasions and in other places. The word "firebreak" was probably first used by me in this Chamber. I have had this in my mind since the very beginning. This explains why it has already been approved as a preventive measure in the UK and in the Netherlands. However, the fact remains that no Member State has asked the Commission to authorise generalised preventive vaccination. Indeed there is a consensus against such an approach, as recently as the European Summit in Stockholm last week. This is in recognition of the limitations of vaccination which I have already outlined and will not repeat again.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a specific example of these limitations which I take directly from the current situation. The original outbreak in the UK was in pigs. It then spread to sheep, some of which unfortunately were exported to other Member States before the virus was detected. It is this presence in sheep which has been the major vector in the spread of this virus. But vaccination in the EU, before the non-vaccination policy introduced in 1991, was confined to cattle. In other words, even if vaccination had been in place as it was before 1991 the major damage would still have occurred. The pigs in Heddon in England where the outbreak originated would still have been infected. They would still have cross-contaminated the sheep. Some of these sheep would still have been exported to France and to Ireland where they would have cross-contaminated calves in transit to the Netherlands. In other words, the outbreak in all four Member States, would almost certainly have occurred given the way it started.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that you are not convinced, what if the animals had been vaccinated against the wrong strain of virus? It needs to be made very clear that the choice of vaccine is not dissimilar to a lottery as I said earlier. You might be lucky and choose the right one, but you are more likely to be unlucky and choose the wrong one – there are seven to choose from, each one with its own sub-types.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, vaccination does have a role, but it is of the nature that I have already outlined, namely limited to use in well-defined circumstances to bring an outbreak under control. This might change if new and more effective vaccines are found, especially if a marker vaccine, which allows us to distinguish vaccinated from infected animals, is developed. We do not have that yet. Some people made that point earlier and they are perfectly right about that. I agree fully with that point. But until then we have to work with the limitations of the existing possibilities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me deal with some of the individual questions. Why is the Commission doing nothing in response to the experience in Africa and Argentina? They are not precedents for anything either. We have a situation in Argentina at the moment where they have had a vaccination policy in place in some areas and not in others, but it has spread to the other areas. Trade was allowed from the free areas. Trade is now stopped to the US, to the European Union and elsewhere so that is no answer. I agree that foot-and-mouth disease must be approached differently from BSE. It is in every respect quite a different issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not have suppressive vaccination which would lead to the final eradication of the disease? The questioner said he had major doubts about this. I said that the introduction of a vaccination now as a firebreak would have some limited effects in circumstances where it was not possible to kill or dispose of an animal within a short space of time. I said the vaccination would not be effective in a period shorter than 6 to 10 days. Mr Böge, I think, said 15 days and that may indeed be correct but it is certainly something in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I am making here – and I said it earlier – is that animals are infective during that period. So if you think the answer to this problem is to administer a vaccination tomorrow to an animal that might be infected because it was in contact with another animal and then believe that animal is not in an infective state and leave it free to come into contact with other animals, you are running the enormous risk of spreading the disease right throughout the livestock. In my view that is an inadequate answer because it does not deal with all the situations that may arise. But it can occur in certain circumstances if you do it in the way that is being done in the Netherlands and is being considered in the UK. But it does require ring-fencing. It does require very severe surveillance and it can only operate in circumstances where it provides a form of firebreak to prevent the disease spreading further to the non-contaminated areas. I was asked to consider the reduction of milk quotas and that, of course, is an issue for my colleague, Franz Fischler, and I will mention to him that the issue was raised this afternoon in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been suggested that the Commission acted too late. I can say with my hand on my heart that is not so. The information came to us on 20 February and we acted within a matter of 12 hours. There was in fact a Commission meeting the following day. We were told on Tuesday night. I brought this up in the Commission meeting on Wednesday. So to say that the Commission did not act promptly in my view is incorrect and unfair. The Commission did act very quickly on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the point is being made that the Commission should have acted before the outbreak. If you say that, you are saying that there should be a generalised policy of vaccination throughout the European Union. We are talking about 300 million animals, seven different types of vaccinations every six months and I do not think anybody is seriously calling for that proposal to be introduced. It was also suggested that the vaccinations are authorised only where there is slaughter subsequently. That is not so. An authorisation has been given in the UK where there is a non-slaughter consequence, where the vaccinations are administered to cows which continue to milk and their milk is properly treated to protect humans. Their meat does go into the food chain but only in a processed form and in strict circumstances and under strict control.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlato also mentioned the point about the Commission not acting quickly enough and I repeat the answer that I gave to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. I have been told that farmers are calling out for a vaccination response. Without prejudice to what I said earlier, a number of other farmers are saying quite the opposite. They have come to me and said "no vaccination policy". I have met the farming unions. They have different views but a substantial number of farmers take the view that there should not be a vaccination policy introduced. I am going to get more information on that subject within the hour. I am meeting COPA again in about half an hour to discuss this issue further. But there is not a unanimous view among the farming community in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Wyn's question on state aids. Yes, of course, if notice is given to the Commission in relation to support of that type a package of measures can be agreed and in fact my understanding is a package of measures has already been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hyland put three questions to me particularly in relation to third countries and the FVO. Of course, the FVO do their work and they are required to do so carefully. The importation of the infected meat in this instance was an illegal importation which would never have been detected, of course, by any FVO inspections. This in fact was an illegal activity. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Agriculture in France also said that the outbreak there was a result of illegal activity and indeed the Minister for Agriculture in Ireland has said exactly the same thing that the outbreak there was the result of illegal activity. It means therefore that the legislation is there, safety measures are in place, but people are not complying with the law and the consequence is that we have had outbreaks in the UK, France and Ireland and the one in the Netherlands is a direct result of the one in France. All of these outbreaks can be traced back to illegal activities, certainly in three countries and maybe in four.</p>
<p class="contents">Two people made reference to the EU taskforce and I know that Mr Hyland made that point earlier. It is something that consideration should be given to. I will take that up with my advisers and have further consideration of that subject. Mr Stevenson made a very important point in relation to vaccinations which was that Saudi Arabia vaccinates. There are a number of different countries in the world where foot-and-mouth disease is endemic and where vaccination is undertaken. But there continue to be outbreaks of other strains of foot-and-mouth disease in that country so that again a generalised policy of vaccination is not the answer. On the question of whether the restrictions will be lifted in the UK, already a restriction has been lifted in Northern Ireland where the circumstances were such as to warrant that particular response.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked why zoos are being closed. I can only conclude that the reason for that is that it is an ultra-precautionary measure. I understand that elephants, camels, antelopes and giraffes apparently are susceptible to the disease. I expect that the zoo owners are responding by saying "well, we had better keep our zoos closed in those circumstances". I also understand that this issue is being discussed in the SVC this afternoon and I expect a decision will be adopted today which will set out the conditions for vaccination of zoo animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Corbey asked me if I believed the EU strategy was failing. I do not believe so because if you examine the spread on the continent of Europe at the moment, you have two cases in France, 12 in the Netherlands, 1 in Ireland. The restrictive measures that have been taken in Ireland, which is the country closest to the major outbreak in the UK, appear so far to be working and vaccination is not in place there. But stringent protective measures are, and to the extent that there has been one outbreak only, within a couple of miles of the outbreak in Northern Ireland, it seems that these strategies are operating.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson then asked me to confirm when the Commission was informed of the outbreak by the UK and I can confirm that the Commission was informed on 20 February. The day the outbreak was known in the UK the Commission was informed immediately. There was certainly no question of the Commission being told anything prior to that date and as I said a moment ago, the Commission responded within a matter of hours at a meeting in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Daul's question, I fully agree with him that we must look at the lessons of this outbreak for communicable human diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lucas made reference to the National Farmers Union. My understanding from my contacts with the National Farmers Union is that they do not want a policy of vaccination introduced in the UK. That is certainly the contact I have had with them most recently unless that view has changed in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Campos then asked why we always have to rely on science? Why cannot we make the decision here today and get on with it? Since I have taken up this job, I have taken the view that I try as best I can to make decisions based on science. If we move away from that we are lost in my view. We then end up in a situation where we make decisions based on subjective analysis rather than objective criteria. That is not the way forward and I do not believe it is the appropriate way to deal with the situation such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Whitehead said that there is a crisis with regard to the movement of animals, and even vaccinated animals can carry the infection. That is the point I was making earlier. It is a serious issue which must be taken into account when we consider the question of vaccination. It is not a simple issue of administering a vaccination to an animal as you would vaccinate a child, for example, against polio. It is something more complex and does not achieve anything like the same result.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Rossa also asked me about vaccination and I just ask the question: where do we vaccinate? If we want to introduce a vaccination policy in France, in the Netherlands or in Ireland where do you start? Is it to be generalised? Is it to be localised? How localised? What area? On what basis? At the moment we do have a localised form of vaccination authorised in two Member States. Is that satisfactory? Is that what you are saying? Do you want more? It is not quite so simple. If you ask the question in relation to vaccination without identifying exactly what you have in mind, I cannot really agree or disagree. But from what I have said already, you have probably gleaned that I agree with the policy of vaccination in some limited circumstances that I have already outlined, but not on a generalised widespread basis, also for the reason that I have already identified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert said that in 1991 she took the view that there should be a policy of no vaccination but the time has come for us to revise our view. I agree, as I said some hours ago when I first addressed the House, that this is something we must look at after this crisis has passed. But it will have to be in circumstances where the vaccination that is available to us and the science available to us in this area are more refined, more focused, so that we can get the best possible result from introducing a vaccination policy. That avoids the risk of creating a situation where we have vaccinated animals but we do not know, when we examine them to see whether they are positive or negative, whether the reaction is a reaction to the vaccination or a reaction to the disease itself. We need science to assist us on this and when that happens we can make more progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
