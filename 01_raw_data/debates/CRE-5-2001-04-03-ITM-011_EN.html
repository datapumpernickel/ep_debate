The report will be sent by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to all the organisations in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a joy and a source of satisfaction to me to present this evening to the European Parliament the report written in response to the Commission’s communication. It also gives me grounds for hope. It is a joy because I am aware that this report has perhaps more influence than others, or at least in a more direct manner, in bringing about the Europe that I have been hoping and praying for, a humane Europe in which we are all involved and which we all hope to achieve, since we are well aware that, having achieved the single market and monetary union, the 21st century will have to try to bring about a humane European Union. Drafting this report has only served to strengthen my belief that we can only make the future of Europe attractive if we start working on a basis of solidarity, justice and respect for others.</p>
<p class="contents">This occasion also provides me with a source of satisfaction because, although my name is on the report, it is above all the product of a new working method in which many useful contacts were fostered with the organisations for people with disabilities, which helped me to write it, particularly the European Forum for Disabled People, and I would like to acknowledge here their extremely valuable contribution to this matter. I also derive satisfaction from the high level of interest shown by my fellow Members, since they tabled over 100 amendments to the original draft. In this respect, I would like to say that out of the amendments that were recently tabled, I shall accept two amendments from the Socialist group. I would also like to thank the Commission’s Directorate-General for Education and Culture for taking part and the European Agency for Special Needs Education, which is based in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the report fills me with hope because, if it is adopted by the European Parliament, it will enable many doors to be opened to the 37 million citizens who live with a disability. This report will be considered from four perspectives: firstly, ‘mainstreaming’ and the right to be different, secondly, ‘family and disability’, because it is true that a disabled person, whether an infant or an old person, is nonetheless someone’s child or parent and it is within this family environment that the most support can be found. The third perspective is to overcome obstacles and access problems. The fourth perspective is that of consultation and information.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these perspectives, we put together a number of proposals. The first is, of course, to start working on the year 2003, which is to be named the European Year of the Disabled Citizens, as announced at Nice. Secondly, we believe that it is important that a number of measures be taken in terms of access to benefits. If Italian, French, Belgian or Greek workers leave their own country to work elsewhere, they should continue to receive the benefits to which they are entitled as a disabled person. This also involves mutual recognition of cards carried by people with disabilities throughout the Union. The issue of access should also be extended to education. We all know that disabled people are not fully or properly integrated into school life. That is why I can announce now that on 26 November 2001, the first European meeting dedicated to teaching and disabilities will be held at the Senate in Paris, in conjunction with the European Academy of Medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of access also includes transport and public buildings. We heard a speech made by Brian Crowley at the inauguration of this building. In this respect, we can announce a forthcoming directive, for example with regard to lifts. I hope that, in this directive, mandatory standards can be specified for disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to tell you very briefly, by pointing out that the report that is presented to you today is both a culmination and a point of departure. At a time when we often speak about ‘lobbying’, I hope that, in view of the year 2003, along with all the organisations, we can use our influence on all the Commission and Council bodies to translate these recommendations – or at least some of them – into directives, so that a European disability policy can be developed in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is necessary to complete the strategy for integrating the rights of people with disabilities into Community policies, particularly the transport sector, access to buildings, the information society and consumer policy. However, I am convinced that the issue of practically integrating people with disabilities will depend not only on traditional obstacles, such as the physical barriers enclosing public areas and transport, being overcome, but, above all, on the general public taking a new approach to the everyday situation of people with disabilities. It is clear that, in these cases, psychological factors and people's prejudices may be much greater obstacles than those created by physical barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point to stress, which also featured in the Stockholm Presidency Conclusions, is that of the integration of people with disabilities into the world of work. We must work towards a situation where companies employ more than the obligatory number of people with disabilities, making things easier for companies by consistently reducing or abolishing both the contribution and tax burdens. This would have the positive effect of using this social potential, which is currently only partially exploited, and would benefit the entire economy. Currently, 37 million European citizens suffer from some form of disability and the unemployment rate for this category is over three times higher than average. Moreover, let us not forget that the quest to achieve full employment in the Union does not mean concentrating solely on job creation but involves providing better jobs for all people, including those with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I consider it essential for research in Europe to play a fundamental role, through its centres, in the development of technologies intended to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. In this way, we would be able to close the gap between Europe and the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I emphasise the role that the Member States must play in improving the skills and promoting the specific professional training of people who cooperate within voluntary associations and the social cooperatives, in order to provide adequate professional training which is suited to the different forms of disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, last Saturday I took part in a rally called "Rights Now" by disabled people in Trafalgar Square in London, where disabled speakers told us how hospital consultants denied them medical treatment because their quality of life was not equal to that of able-bodied patients. The new charging policies for social care services effectively stop them from benefiting from those essential services. Whereas sexism and racism are well-known terms, disability discrimination is barely referred to in public discourse.</p>
<p class="contents">I start my speech with this bleak assessment because in our proper desire to support the Commission in their barrier-free Europe communication, and Mrs Hermange, in her excellent response, we risk forgetting the very real exclusion from every aspect of public life which is the daily reality for disabled people in our societies. In the strong consensus we have achieved in supporting the bulk of the proposals let us remember we will encounter real conflict in delivering on the aims agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the European Commission's proposal to make 2003 the year of disabled citizens but its impact will be diminished if the Commission does not, during that same year, publish a general disability discrimination directive which offers comprehensive civil rights to disabled people in Europe, similar to the American Disabilities Act, on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the Socrates Programme offers additional support for disabled participants, but point out that there is a long way to go before the extra costs of disability, the provision of specialist transport, personal assistance and sign language interpreters are provided for in all mainstream European programmes to make equal participation a reality. I welcome the sign language interpretation taking place in both the Chamber and the public gallery. I only wish we could see it regularly in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We emphasise that the specialist and mainstream provision can go hand-in-hand and can complement each other, that the loss of the tied aspects of the research and development programme were not fully replaced with mainstreaming and that a specialist disability section should be allocated in the sixth framework programme now being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">We point out that fine words about free movement can never be fully realised until difficult issues for Member States, including the protection for social security benefits for disabled workers crossing our borders, can be tackled. We watch carefully when talk about interdepartmental cooperation in the Commission, on public procurement for example, shows steadfast opposition by DG internal market against awarding public contracts with full reference to companies' equal employment record.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Commissioner for Employment to identify a clear timetable for binding disability access standards to the built environment to be established, and, equally, to ensure seamless access by disabled persons to all modes of public transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate her for making it available in braille and through sign language interpreters. This is such a good report because of the cross-party cooperation, similar to the cross-party cooperation there was on the article concerning anti-discrimination, and because of the input from the disabled people's organisations themselves. We had 97 amendments in committee, and we have only five for this plenary session. That demonstrates how we have all worked together and particularly that Mrs Hermange has listened to the points that have been put to her and incorporated them into this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope also that this report will act as a springboard for the year 2003, the Year of Disabled Citizens, but hopefully we can bring forward the disability directive that Mr Howitt has just referred to within that year, so as to actually make a commitment to a positive disability directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is about breaking down barriers for disabled people, to get rid of the prejudices that disabled people face in their daily lives across the European Union. That is what we are aiming to achieve. It is disgraceful that we need this report, that disabled people are not treated like other people. We must make sure that disabled people are mainstreamed, that they are not sidelined, that they are taken into account in all sectors – in the information society, in public procurement, in employment. As Mr Mantovani said, the level of unemployment is three times higher for disabled people. Let us hope that this report, together with the employment directive, will address that issue. We must look at all the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying again to Mrs Hermange that she has produced an excellent report but one that we must make sure that we put into practice. Fine words are one thing, making sure that in practice disabled people are treated exactly the same as everyone else is another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This communication and report are very important in this context, and I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done and the breadth of the consultation she has undertaken. These documents provide a welcome addition, as many have said, to the Article 13 Directive relating to equal treatment at work, which, of course, presupposes the ability to get work or rather to be offered it, and a more inclusive attitude in society. Therefore, I welcome the recognition of inclusive education within this report and the wider understanding and the breaking down of barriers that we hope will come with it. I feel that many of us adults could also do with such education.</p>
<p class="contents">Inclusion, of course, should start with access to information here, access to all parts of our buildings and, as others have said but I also want to repeat, we need to extend inclusion to the freedom of movement. I would particularly recommend paragraphs 22 and 23, on this concerning the mutual recognition of national cards carried by people with disabilities. That is a frequent subject of petitions and correspondence to many of us in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also mention, as you might expect from Parliament's rapporteur on the relevant regulation, the need for the exportability of disability benefits for people, not least so that they have the opportunity to meet the financial requirements for residents in some Member States. The reasons for the current practice are not well understood and practice is extremely unjust in that it removes the freedom of choice which other citizens have had. I echo the calls for a further directive which really brings this into a whole rights-based approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue is becoming even more important, given that there are more than 37 million people in the European Union with some kind of disability. It is crucial that we adopt all the measures necessary to guarantee everyone genuine freedom of movement, including not only the opportunity to travel in transport that has been adapted for the purpose, but also to study, work, be part of society and live in dignity in any of the European Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important that we establish the conditions necessary to guarantee everyone access to jobs that provide rights, by making access to training easier, by producing incentives and by undertaking positive action in order to combat unemployment, which, amongst the disabled, is three times higher than the European Union average. It is also crucial that we take account of the need to prevent new forms of social exclusion, specifically ‘info-exclusion’, which requires an action plan for the real participation of disabled people in the information society, in addition to guaranteeing the right of access of the disabled to electronic and telecommunications services and equipment. European research centres must also play a more active role in conducting technological research into improving the quality of life of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating discrimination against the disabled requires practical measures to support families that have one or more disabled members, and the establishment of a ‘school for all’, which will ensure that disabled children can integrate, and which will also provide all the necessary support, with, where necessary, specialist teachers and specialist teaching methods. We also need to provide real impetus at legislative level and to practical actions, incorporating into various policies the integration of disabled people and the participation of their organisations in defining, monitoring and assessing these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore agree with most of the proposals contained in the report by Mrs Hermange, whom I congratulate and whom we shall help to the best of our ability, specifically through a proposal that we are now presenting, in the hope that the Commission and the Council acknowledge the importance of paying close attention to this issue and to achieving the full integration of disabled people into all aspects of life and take advantage of the plan to make the year 2003 the European Year of Disabled Citizens to raise the awareness of the general public and Member States about this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the outset I want to congratulate and thank Madam Hermange for her advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities and in particular for her willingness to take on board new ideas with regard to creating a barrier-free Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Any charter of rights, any constitution will tell you, that all people are borne equal, yet every single day disabled people in the European Union are treated as unequal. In fact, in many scenarios they are treated as inferior beings to the rest of society. I can bring hundreds of examples of discrimination, of ignorance, thousands of examples of prejudice. When we speak about a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities, our main focus is always on legislation, on new innovation with regard to buildings or access to transport. These are all key and important elements, but the first thing that we have to overcome, the first barrier that has to be jumped is a psychological barrier and the prejudices within each and every one of us. When we see someone with a disability, instead of focusing on the disability, let us treat everyone as equal, focus on their ability and give them the tools of information, of training, of education and of opportunity to really show how much ability they actually have.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this report to the House and would ask that it should not just be an expression of good intentions or the conscience of the Members of this House or of the Commission, but lead to real action before 2003, so that then when we celebrate the European Year for the Disabled Citizen, we can actually say that we have made progress and moved beyond some of the barriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we might not realise it, we are not nevertheless mistaken in stating that the number of people suffering some form of disability in the European Union stands at around 10% of the population, which currently means some 37 million people, and that disability is not a homogenous category.</p>
<p class="contents">We could say that there is no such thing as disability, but rather there are disabled people and therefore, whether the disabilities are visible or invisible, slight or serious, single or multiple, chronic or intermittent, whether they affect mobility, hearing, sight or speech, all of these people – and I repeat, people – have to face difficult barriers when it comes to accessing the various aspects or areas of their social lives despite these limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like specifically to refer to the area of employment in relation to this policy which is intended to create a barrier-free Europe and furthermore a Europe with a high level of employment. And therefore, to name but a few factors, we should refer to the adaptation of the procedures for examinations and tests of the abilities of disabled candidates; access to specific training activities for general employees and, perhaps, for public officials in particular, with reduced abilities; to measures for the retention of staff who have suffered some incapacity during, or in the execution of, their work; to the reorganisation of work and flexible hours, part-time work, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me to be extremely important that 2003 be declared European Year of Disabled Citizens. It seems equally important – maybe more – that each day we reinforce the idea that each and every disabled person is one more citizen, one more European of the almost 400 million Europeans who are protected by Article 13 of the EC Treaty and who expect specific actions, the coordination of policies within the European Union and who expect to see an increase in people’s awareness and sensitivity, since it may be that the main barrier they face is a lack of awareness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has been exemplary in the way she has attended to her task as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">People with disabilities are discriminated against today. Freedom of movement, which is basic to EU cooperation, is significantly more difficult for people with disabilities to make use of when it comes to seeking work or, in the case of young people, studying in other countries. There is clear discrimination in this area. The same applies to the labour market. Unemployment among people with disabilities is very high. They also find it more difficult to achieve the kind of access to information we often discuss nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">We must adopt a pro-active attitude, for all this can be prevented. Disability is not a static phenomenon. It is the environment which is at fault, and this can be changed. Nowadays, we have interpretation using sign language, for example. We can design buildings and workplaces differently, making them more accessible to people with disabilities. This is something which is possible to implement, because it is about changes to the environment. We can implement changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The change must affect all areas of policy, moreover. Not only can social, transport or labour market policies be changed, but all policy areas. In the labour market, where unemployment is approximately three times higher for people with disabilities, it is important that, in addition to devising indicators for improving older people’s, women’s and other groups’ chances of obtaining work, we should also include people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have pointed out how important a change in social attitudes is to integration. I myself come from the world of education. It is important for people with disabilities not to be hidden away but to be included in the world of education so that everyone can obtain education and training on the same terms and so that we see how people with different qualities are able to work together. That is incredibly important if attitudes are to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important for voluntary organisations and organisations representing people with disabilities to be integrated into this work. Let the Year of Disabled Citizens be a point of departure for an offensive in which we devise new directives and a new action programme, so that we can obtain a Europe without obstacles and with equal opportunities for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to change our way of thinking, but I believe that it is crucial to propose a series of measures, as Mrs Hermange has, in favour of a genuine policy of non-discrimination. To be recognised as being different, but having the right to be fairly treated is the philosophy that runs through all the proposals, particularly those relating to easy access to the work place and to public spaces, the exportability of disability benefits for workers and dependent persons within the EU or the mutual recognition of national cards carried by people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also stresses the need for a sense of responsibility with regard to equal treatment in the labour market, vocational training and education. Professional integration is therefore associated with social integration. In this respect, the report shows that the value of the work performed by a person with a disability cannot be measured solely in terms of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these are ambitious guidelines that give a true reflection of the overall thinking of the parliamentary committee concerned and the determination of the organisations representing people with disabilities. I would add that the proposal to monitor and evaluate the measures adopted seems to be a very positive step, as does the transition from a simple intergovernmental policy to a Community policy in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only see two shortcomings. On the one hand, the report adopts, in my view, an extremely hesitant attitude towards businesses with regard to the employment of people with disabilities, and the proposal regarding the income of people with disabilities who are in employment is much too weak – and I quote ‘an income at least equal to the level of benefits received by people who are not in employment’. On the other hand, the ambiguous nature of the part of paragraph 20 which relates to research into therapies at the beginning of life must, in my opinion, be withdrawn, which justifies the amendment tabled by my group. Incidentally, this report was much needed and I believe, as do my colleagues, that it is also extremely good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, have you seen how we all agree on this issue? There is no dissent: we all want society to recognise that people with disabilities should receive what it is right for them to have. However, people have been saying these sorts of things for 35 years, and still nothing tangible has been done. In your opinion, who is responsible for this, Commissioner Diamantopoulou? The answer is clear, for the bench normally occupied by the culprits is empty: it is the Council's bench. It is the governments which do not want to give people with disabilities what it is right to give them. And it is the Council of Ministers of the European Union that has the power to do something: its absence tonight is proof of that. And that means the Swedish Presidency, which we all consider to be one of the most enlightened. Well then, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I am sending you a message saying that I am sure you are the best ambassador and determined supporter of the rights of people with disabilities: it is the governments and the Council of Ministers of the European Union who have to do what we all agree has to be done. If nothing has been done thus far, it is because the governments of our 15 States are blind, deaf and dumb. They are the true disabled in this European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All that remains to be seen, between now and 2003, is just how serious the intentions behind this policy are. This sort of policy can only be implemented through a specific programme of actions, target evaluations, statistics and specific, self-imposed deadlines. Mrs Hermange’s report is, without exaggeration, a particularly important paper because it captures all aspects of the problem with perfect clarity and proposes a universal policy at all levels and in the broadest possible sense, by setting specific targets. </p>
<p class="contents">We need to recognise the importance of this basic position on people with disabilities, irrespective of their individual disability, and of their needs as a whole as citizens, producers and consumers. We agree that the initiatives taken under this new approach are not tantamount to concessions or generosity or evaluated merely as costs, but form part of our productive system, which they further, and of our social model, which they strengthen. This new concept should also inform corresponding policies in the Member States. The point is whether or not the Member States are mature enough to look at it from this angle. It is no easy task. If it is to succeed, we must alter entrenched, opposing perceptions and mobilise the public sectors responsible, in order to prove that policies in education, culture, sport, employment and other sectors cannot succeed unless they incorporate the problems of persons with disabilities. </p>
<p class="contents">So the message is that we are moving from an awareness to practicalities and that the aim is to ensure that these people play a full part in economic and social life. In the final analysis, with increasing numbers of disabilities as the result of road traffic accidents and accidents at work, we are all potentially members of this group of people and this issue does not only concern a number of unlucky, preordained people; it concerns all of us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, to create a barrier-free Europe for disabled people, to enable them to lead a life and have a career as everyone else does not just require good intentions; it also requires resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, if we take just these examples, although the efforts made to provide education are scandalously inadequate, although the most basic facilities are lacking in public places and transport, it really is because Member States, instead of providing the money needed to this basic form of solidarity, spend it on financial support and subsidies to employers. And how can we not condemn the derisory amount that those who are unable to work receive in benefits? How can we tolerate a situation in which insurance companies refuse to insure disabled people or overcharge them, which is a form of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pious hope to merely ask the Commission to propose that Member States urge companies to employ disabled workers. Even in the Member States which have financial penalties for employers who disregard the quotas for employing disabled people, the employers prefer to pay the fine and not employ them. When it comes to commercial contracts, however, legislators know how to impose tough rules. Well, equally harsh mandatory measures must be taken against employers who refuse to employ disabled people or who do not adapt the workplace as necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note that, like many of her fellow members, she has identified two basic aspects to the problem. The first is preconception and relates to cultural and political change and the second is the need for equal opportunities and equal access to all types of activity. This second objective of equal access means specific policies for 12% of Europe’s citizens. To give you a clear idea of the numbers involved, 37 million people with disabilities equate to about 9 countries the size of Denmark. And the Commission communication, like Mrs Hermange’s report, emphasizes the need for a horizontal approach to the issue of disability, i.e. the need to approach all policies and to take account of this aspect in all types of decision, which is why the communication also specifically refers to the need for access to buildings, the architectural dimension, employment, transport, research, technology, education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that we have had three interesting examples of this in the short interval between the Commission communication and the report. First, the endeavour concerning the rights of airline passengers. This consultation at European level, which is now ready for signing, involved the airlines and the Commission, as well as groups of people with disabilities, the aim being to agree on specific, binding undertakings to safeguard the rights of all passengers and people with disabilities. The second interesting example is the e-EUROPE initiative, which incorporates five different specific lines of approach defining the needs of people with disabilities as regards access to all the new technologies and IT systems. Finally, the third example is the programme for research and technology announced recently, which again includes both specific commitments to special technologies for aids and appliances to assist people with disabilities and social research and studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable members, as you have rightly pointed out, we need specific action and, of course, we need to take account of the fact that, at European level, there is the potential to add value to the policies of the Member States, given that this sector still comes almost entirely within the jurisdiction of the Member States. Nonetheless, I think that there are several specific issues worth mentioning here, such as legislation. Thanks to the catalytic role of the European Parliament, we recently managed to adopt the directive banning discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace in record time. This directive represents a truly historic decision by the institutions of the European Union and the challenge now is to ensure that it is applied correctly. In addition, all the action programmes currently being developed and announced by the Commission contain specific reference to and a commitment towards people with disabilities; this applies to the EQUAL initiative, the programmes against discrimination and exclusion and the fifth women’s programme. I also think employment policy and strategy are worth mentioning. Last year, at Parliament’s suggestion, the Commission agreed that our objective should be to include persons with disabilities in training and the employment strategy, an objective which was not, however, accepted by the Council of Ministers. We shall come back to this again this year, in a bid to set specific quantitative targets at European and national level for the participation of people with disabilities in the employment strategy programme, be it in the form of training, lifelong learning, access to new technologies or subsidised jobs. This will be one of our priorities over coming years. I should also mention that the Commission is preparing a communication on companies’ social responsibilities. This communication will take particular account – and we are already working on this with special networks of companies – of the fact that each company is personally and specifically responsible for applying social policies and policies to integrate people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently visited the companies which received Commission awards last year for incorporating people with disabilities in their workforce and it was a most pleasant surprise to see practical examples of small and medium-sized companies increasing their profits by making use of the exceptionally well-honed talents of people with disabilities. I should also like to mention the specific problem of transferring benefits to other countries; this problem will be very hard to resolve due to the huge differences in both how the systems are organised and the level of benefits. Regulation 1408/71 does not in fact make provision for transfers or for discussing the question of disability benefits. And, of course, there is currently considerable reaction on the part of numerous countries to benefit transfers, due to the huge financial costs involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say that 2003 will really be a big challenge. At present we are discussing the political framework for 2003. Of course, we shall be discussing the matter with Parliament before we draft our overall proposal, but 2003 will be a huge challenge for all of us, because we shall need to show that we are capable of action, not just words.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
