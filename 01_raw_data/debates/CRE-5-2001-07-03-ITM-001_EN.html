It is important for the European Union’s different institutions to support, inspire, criticise and cooperate with one another but never forget that we have a common mission to develop our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish presidency’s objective was to proceed from important decisions to the implementation of those decisions. Our ambition was not to add new decisions but, rather, to implement decisions already taken. We wanted to concentrate on three areas, which I had the opportunity to talk about when I was in Parliament at the beginning of the presidency. These were enlargement of the Union and issues relating to employment and the environment. In addition, we wanted to develop the Union’s common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I make no claim to provide a comprehensive review of the Swedish presidency in my report. Instead, I would offer some reflections upon the last six months. We have worked incredibly hard with the Commission in order to press on with the enlargement negotiations. The objective of this work was to show that the timetable drawn up by the Commission for the enlargement negotiations was realistic. We can now see that, during the Swedish presidency, we did everything we intended to do, and a little more besides. The very ambitious timetable drawn up by the Commission proved to be realistic. This was the basis for the European Council in Göteborg when we said that, in our judgment, we should have completed negotiations with the best prepared countries before the end of 2002 and that we also anticipated the first of today’s candidate countries’ participating, as Members of the European Union, in the elections to the European Parliament in 2004. We were given a clear signal concerning the enlargement we wanted to see. We were given this because the negotiating work had been successful. This does not, of course, mean that the enlargement process has been carried out, but an important step has been taken. What is required is continued concentration and continued support for the Commission’s work and for the forthcoming presidencies, but also an appreciation of the fact that many of the difficulties represented by the enlargement process are, in fact, to be found within the European Union as it stands and not in relations with the candidate countries. The most demanding task for us within the European Union is to work out common positions for the fifteen Member States. There is a further demanding task. Our friends and colleagues in the candidate countries have the task of implementing reforms in their countries of such a kind as will prepare them for membership of the European Union. We must not forget, however, that we ourselves have to conduct an internal debate within the Union which, from a political perspective, is probably as difficult as the reforms which our friends have to implement in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We said in Göteborg that enlargement would be a fact by 2004. To cite the French President’s description of the project, it is an irrevocable process. At the same time, we also said that we must be realistic and appreciate that there are certain countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria, which need extra support in their preparations. We are not talking here about extra financial support, but about support in the work of negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">When Sweden took over the presidency, it was also our ambition to develop the foreign and security policy. We did not, however, emphasise this so much in our presidency programme, even though we mentioned it. Instead, we adopted the strategy of taking action. I am convinced that what we have managed to achieve in terms of foreign policy will be something that develops during forthcoming presidencies, for such development is to the European Union’s advantage when it comes to external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking, above all, of three important factors. Increasingly, practical foreign policy is linked, firstly, to values, democracy and human rights; secondly, to economic relations, especially trade; and, thirdly, to a just and progressive aid policy, to which, from our point of view, it will continue to be linked. This last consideration is something to which we devote too little time and attention. It is an undervalued factor in external relations. These three factors indicate a development parallel to that of the European Union. If we are then able to act in concert on the basis of our values, we can also exercise influence.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Swedish presidency, we have developed our relations with Russia. Not for a moment have we concealed our disapproval of the situation in, for example, Chechnya. Never have we concealed our views on the situation in Russia where the freedom of the media is concerned, but we have, at the same time, developed relations in order to create economic cooperation and a dialogue characterised by trust.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also said that Russia is not enough. Russia is just one important factor. In that part of Europe, it is also a question of developing relations with Ukraine, which is a large, strategically important country with a European identity and which must have the option of belonging to Europe. According to the Göteborg conclusions, Ukraine is a country which, together with Moldova, will, in future, be invited to participate in the European conference. In that way, the European Union is also developing a relationship specifically in terms of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">During our presidency, we also met the American president for the first time in the group of Fifteen. The fifteen Member States took part in a dialogue directly with the American president, just as we had met the Russian president. In that context, there was naturally a great deal of talk about the Kyoto issue, about which we most certainly do not, of course, have the same views – a fact which there was no point at all in concealing. On the contrary, there is reason for conducting a very open and tough debate, because we believe that the United States is not complying with those obligations it had earlier sent signals it was prepared to stand by. I am pleased that the European Union remained completely united in its dialogue with the United States about Kyoto. That was incredibly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with the United States are not just about Kyoto. They are also, of course, about the situations in the Balkans and the Middle East and other international issues on which we hold similar positions and have every reason to cooperate. During the Swedish presidency, the European Union’s active presence in the Middle East has also, of course, been emphasised. That is important. The Middle East is the European Union’s neighbour. If the crisis in the Middle East escalates further – and we can, of course, all see that there is a very great risk of this happening – it will also become our own crisis, which is something that must be prevented using every political means available. Where the Middle East is concerned, too, this has been an extraordinarily active period from the points of view of the presidency, the Commission and also Secretary-General/High Representative Javier Solana.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, a list can be made of foreign policy activities. Think too of North and South Korea, where the peace process must continue and be brought to a conclusion. The European Union, too, might be able to play a role there in the right circumstances. A picture is emerging of a European Union which is becoming more and more active in the field of foreign policy because we stand for common values, common views and a common approach. When we act together, we exercise influence. That is the signal.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement, foreign policy and environmental issues – these issues were incredibly important to the Swedish presidency. The Commission and Commissioner Wallström provided us with a very good basis in the form of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and, subsequently, the Commission’s report on sustainable development. In Göteborg, we were able to establish principles for dealing with environmental issues in the future. We were able to establish that these processes must now also be integrated into the Lisbon process. In that way, we were able to take a decisive step towards sustainable development in its three dimensions: economic, social and ecological. That was an extraordinarily sound foundation provided by the Commission and each successive presidency and Commission must now make that foundation more secure and give it ever more practical expression. Perhaps matters are not progressing quickly enough. It is my feeling that they never do when it comes to the issue of the environment. On the other hand, we have the processes. We have a direction in which to move, and the first necessary political decisions have been taken. I believe that the decision taken in Göteborg was an extraordinarily important one.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we also discussed the economic issues in Göteborg. We dealt with a number of the decisions which had, as it were, been left over from the Stockholm Summit – European Single Sky, the issues surrounding patents, general economic development, the demographic issue and lasting pension systems. Also on the agenda were matters which do not, of course, give rise to such a very great deal of opposition within the European Union today but, rather, provide something of an impetus for working together on issues which we know will, in actual fact, be of crucial importance to people’s lives in our part of the world during the next 20-30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had occasion, during our presidency, to pilot through to the decision-making stage a proposal concerning transparency in the European Union and the accessibility of documents. Let me say that it would not have been possible to arrive at that decision but for the very active support of Parliament. This is an excellent example of how Parliament, together with the Council and also the Commission, can implement a change. I am obviously not completely satisfied. We could have gone further but, as in all political contexts, not everything is achieved. We obtained a compromise along the right lines. It made the European Union more open, but it was not the finished product. I should like to see the debate continue, but our citizens are nonetheless now better placed to keep track of the things we are doing in the Union and, on <span class="italic">objective</span> grounds, to examine these critically and present alternatives – on <span class="italic">objective</span> grounds, I say, precisely because the information is available.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Swedish presidency, we have also begun the debate on the future. It will dominate the Belgian presidency and will, when 2004 comes around, result in a major decision being taken. The guidelines from Nice have been assigned, that is to say what will mainly be found within the framework of the debate. Now, both you and I know that, in a debate on the future of the European Union, we shall not be satisfied with concentrating on the four issues we cited in Nice. Instead, there will be a broader debate. Let it be just such a broad debate. Let it be a debate on what the European Union is, in actual fact, aiming for and on what it wants to do, and let there then be a discussion on how this is to be achieved. We must not always begin with a discussion on building and developing the institutions and then eventually conclude with the political discussion on what it is we want. Turn the debate on its head: invite the people of Europe to take part, broaden the debate and do not set any limits to it. Progressively structure the debate as a proper Intergovernmental Conference aimed at making the European Union more rational and more powerful. Our ambition was to launch a broad debate, and that is something we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning, we in the Swedish presidency have taken great pains to cooperate with Parliament. I was doing some totting up yesterday and worked out that Swedish ministers have taken part in debates and discussions in this Assembly or in other constellations associated with Parliament on 86 occasions. It has been incredibly worthwhile for us, and it is something I want to thank you for.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that we now believe we have obtained a breakthrough with the Members’ Charter and can press for a solution to that issue. That is the way it looks following an initial decision. I am pleased that, when we talk about Parliament and relations between the presidency and Parliament, we can also say that we have received a great many good ideas and proposals from yourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank all the officials in the Commission, in Parliament and in the Council who have supported us during the presidency. Naturally, I am also deeply grateful towards my own colleagues in the Swedish Cabinet Office and Ministries who have enabled us to say, as we draw the Swedish presidency to a close, that we have made some progress. In the course of our six months, we took a few steps in the direction we wanted to go. I now hope that the Belgian presidency will do some further work on these major issues. I intend to do what I can to help ensure that my colleague, Mr Verhofstadt, is given all the constructive support he needs, in exactly the same way as I, during the Swedish presidency, have had extraordinarily fine support from Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin, the French president and prime minister. This was an absolute precondition for the success of our presidency and I am deeply grateful for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that, as our various parliaments around Europe enter their summer recess, there is an issue which I think we have to take away with us, namely the issue which, in all likelihood, is to be a feature of the debate about the future: that of how we are to make the European Union more open and more results-oriented and of how it is to be brought closer to our citizens. How is this to happen? What is that development to look like? What is possible in an enlarged Union? The Union will grow. That is something we now know following this presidency. It will grow and become a large Union with perhaps a further five, ten or perhaps still more Member States both in this Parliament and in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your constructive cooperation. I look forward to a continued relationship with the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This meeting too was, in the end, about issues of widely differing kinds. Two decisions merit particular attention because they will advance European integration and shape policy in the medium and long term. I therefore want to concentrate on these two decisions in my presentation in this chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the European Council has given us a fixed timetable for the first round of enlargement. It should be possible for negotiations with those candidate countries that are ready to be completed at the end of next year. The new Member States will therefore be able to participate as fully fledged Members in the elections to the European Parliament in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Council gave its support to a strategy for sustainable development. This strategy involves the European Union’s undertaking to take certain measures to ensure that it will be possible for prosperity in Europe and the rest of the world to be maintained in the long term too. Through the Lisbon process, the environment has ended up at the centre of our policy. These are important and practical decisions that the Commission welcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence on the streets of Göteborg I was also there and saw it with my own eyes – must not overshadow the important political decisions taken in Göteborg. We all condemn the violence, for stones can never replace arguments. Nor do they reflect people’s interests, either in the Member States or in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by commenting on the summit’s decisions on enlargement. The European Council drew the following conclusion, and I quote: ‘Provided that progress towards meeting the accession criteria continues at an unabated pace, the road map should make it possible to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 for those candidate countries that are ready. The objective is that they should participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members’. The European Union’s commitment to receiving new members has never been expressed more clearly or more precisely than in Göteborg. The process is now irrevocable. The Union is ready to meet the challenge of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In Göteborg, more details were provided of the timetable sketched out in the conclusions from the Nice Summit. In that way, it has become a realistic possibility that the negotiations with those States that have progressed furthest will be completed at the end of next year, and the objective has been set of their being able to participate in the elections to the European Parliament in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s timetable for the negotiations has therefore proved to be realistic. The Swedish presidency’s <span class="italic">extraordinary</span> way of handling the agenda and its determined way of conducting the negotiations has contributed significantly to this result. The prospects for a successful conclusion to the negotiations are now better than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations will continue in accordance with those principles that have been established: the candidate countries will be judged solely on the basis of their own merits; the negotiations must take place separately for each country; and those countries which entered into the negotiations at the beginning of 2000 must be given an opportunity to catch up. We want to be clear on this point: the enlargement process can only succeed if there is enough political support. The negotiations must therefore be conducted with a certain flexibility so that the candidate countries’ wishes and concerns may be taken into account. Consideration must be given to the social price which people in the candidate countries will have to pay. We cannot make unreasonable demands upon the candidate countries when it comes to the financial burden involved for them in adopting EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">On 15 May, President Prodi presented the Commission’s proposals for a strategy of sustainable development to you here in Parliament. Today, we are pleased to be able to note that the European Council supports a strategy of sustainable development for the European Union. Certainly, the meeting was unable to agree to all the individual measures and objectives listed by the Commission in its communication. Nonetheless, the Göteborg conclusions provide clear indications of the direction in which the European Council wants our policy – and our society – to develop. The conclusions also include a challenge to the Council to examine the individual proposals from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Brundtland Commission’s definition, sustainable development is a ‘development meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’. The Göteborg Summit means that the European Union is making significant progress along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Göteborg conclusions emphasise firstly that we must become better at framing our policy: We must get to grips with conflicting interests, or policy inconsistencies, in a considered and open way instead of ignoring them. We must strive for a policy which can meet quite a few different objectives at the same time. We must weigh immediate needs against the long-term consequences of decisions and their impact outside the EU. That applies to <span class="italic">all</span> the institutions of the European Union. The European Council has called upon them to improve the coordination of domestic policy in different sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important decision in this context was the decision to supplement the Lisbon strategy with an environmental dimension. As from next year, sustainable development will be a permanent item on the agenda of the European Council’s spring meetings. That is important progress. The process has been established, and the Commission will prepare for this annual review with a comprehensive report. From a political perspective, this means that the environmental dimension of sustainable development has now been accorded the same dignity as the economic and social issues. The Lisbon process has become still more important by having now become the framework for work on promoting <span class="italic">all</span> the dimensions of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also noted that, in its plan of measures for better legislation – to be submitted to the European Council meeting in Laeken – the Commission will introduce mechanisms whereby all important political proposals will contain an assessment of how sustainability will be affected. The Council also emphasised the importance of enabling parties who are affected to participate. In the forthcoming white paper on administration, we shall be tabling practical proposals for improving consultation with parties affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are called upon to devise their own national strategies for sustainable development. It is obviously an important task for MEPs, too, to follow this up in their respective Member States. These are important decisions because sustainable development can scarcely be achieved if there are no effective procedures or effective decision making to guarantee consistent, long-term policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Council has, in line with the Commission’s proposal, drawn attention to four priority areas for sustainable development. These areas supplement the Lisbon programme’s economic and social objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, climate change. This is one of the most serious problems of our age. The Kyoto Protocol is a first step towards getting to grips with this problem. As you know, the EU is doing its utmost right now to try to rescue the protocol. Climate change entails enormous costs for ourselves and the rest of the world. The greatest cost of all is borne by those who live in poor countries. At the same time, climate policy provides financial opportunities for more efficient energy use, as well as opportunities – if taken proper advantage of – for the use of cleaner, renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: public health. This is threatened by, for example, accumulations of chemicals in the environment and the ever more widespread resistance to antibiotics. This is an area which affects people directly and which is of concern to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the waste of natural resources and reduced biological diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the transport system. If this is to function in the long term, then limits must be placed upon traffic congestion, the increase in the amount of traffic and the effects upon the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">These four areas demand decisive leadership and rapid intervention. The policy proposals presented by the Commission in its communication are still relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development must be given the highest priority when the common policy is reviewed. The European Council takes note of this fact – with particular reference to agriculture and fisheries. A number of further specific and overarching measures and objectives for each one of these four priority areas were established at the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that sustainable development must not only be focused on the problems, concerns and costs, but that it is just as much a question of innovation, investments, growth and new jobs as of environmental protection, health and quality of life. Sustainable development as a concept and idea makes for new economic opportunities. We are very pleased that the European Council shares this view and has emphasised this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally: Europe also has an <span class="italic">international</span> responsibility for sustainable development. The presidency’s conclusions again highlight the European Union’s commitment to achieving the UN’s objectives for aid and development aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP. At the beginning of next year, the Commission will present a communication on how the European Union is to be able to contribute globally to sustainable development. That communication, together with the sustainable development strategy put forward in Göteborg, will be the EU’s main contribution to the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe expect the European Union not only to look to today’s needs but also to secure their children’s and grandchildren’s future. People expect us to be involved in solving the global problems constituted by environmental damage and under-development. That is what sustainable development is about. The fact that the European Council in Göteborg approved a sustainable development strategy and also instituted a process for devising and implementing such a strategy therefore constitutes significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is an historic opportunity to guarantee stability and prosperity in Europe for a long time to come. The practical timetable established in Göteborg is therefore of the very greatest importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In our assessment, the European Council in Göteborg was successful and produced practical results. The meeting marks the end of a presidency with which the Commission has cooperated well and which has done a lot, especially within my own area of responsibility.</p>

This is a debate about the Swedish presidency, about an important summit, and I really am amazed. This comment is not aimed at you, Commissioner Wallström, I respect you personally and I respect your work. However, it is not acceptable for the President of the Commission to be represented by a Member of the Commission from the country currently holding the presidency. This is not just some kind of Swedish project, we are discussing the future of Europe. In future I expect to see the President of the European Commission here in plenary when such important matters are being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to make a positive comment and then a critical one. First of all, let me remind you that my group has proposed that we should conclude the accession negotiations with the first countries by autumn 2002, so that the first countries could then participate in the June 2004 European elections. This has been accepted by this House, by the Commission and by the European Council in Nice, and you are now saying this in an even more specific way. I realise that there has been strong opposition to this. However, you have been successful, and we are also grateful that a broad majority of the Swedish people is in favour of enlargement. Mr President-in-Office, if you are right, if you do something positive, then you deserve recognition for that and I would like to express my thanks and recognition to you for having got the 2004 deadline included in the decisions taken at Göteborg.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">While we are talking about the Swedish people, an extremely likeable people, I would like to express the hope – in your own interest as well, Mr President-in-Office, as the Swedish Prime Minister – that agreement to enlargement will, in future, be matched by agreement on the single European currency, so that Sweden will remain fully integrated in our European political family. I wish that for you and for all of us, because we are a Community. A decision by Sweden in favour of the euro is also part of this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But now for a critical comment. There were some tragic disturbances in Göteborg, but I do not want to judge the police's handling of the security arrangements, because I know far too little about that. However, I would like to comment on what you, Mr President-in-Office, said on Swedish television on 17 June. My colleague Gunilla Carlsson, the chair of the Swedish delegation in our group, has already said something about this. You spoke about Fascist forces. To avoid any misunderstanding, let me say that I am most definitely in favour of resolutely fighting Fascists and right-wing extremists wherever they appear, politically speaking, and whenever they use force. But on Thursday, during our preparatory meeting of the Group of the European People's Party, we could see that the flags being paraded through Göteborg were red ones, and no acts of actual violence took place until the Friday to Saturday. You could see portraits of Che Guevara and of Fidel Castro, so you cannot just say that Fascists were involved. We also know, and I can quote a major European newspaper, that the hard core was an anti-Fascist group of left-wing revolutionaries taking belligerent and critical action against the European movement and against world trade. We would have expected you to be just as critical of those left-wing revolutionaries who use force as we are against those on the right who resort to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and our legal system are too important for us to turn a blind eye. We should not, because of superficial party interests, fail to recognise the wider importance of our democratic and constitutional system, and we should join forces against any form of violence, whichever side it comes from, from the extreme right or the extreme left, as an act of democratic solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, let me make one more observation. You have made great efforts to achieve transparency, indeed that is one of the hallmarks of Sweden, and we have made a little progress as regards publishing documents. You can take some credit for that, but not all of it. For example, our colleague and your fellow citizen, Charlotte Cederschiöld, has helped a lot in ensuring that we have achieved greater transparency in this regard. We should continue to follow this path. We also want greater cooperation with the Council of Ministers and a greater presence here in the European Parliament. There were also some critical comments about this at the beginning, but they did not relate to Sweden, but rather to the Council of Ministers. However, I believe that we can build on your work.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is about a positive signal: you invited the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Putin, and the American President, George Bush, to the Göteborg Summit. It would certainly be a good thing if we in the European Parliament could also invite these two figures to visit our Parliament, perhaps in the reverse order, first President Bush and then President Putin, as our relations with America and Russia are vital for the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, it is not for me to award marks, but one Swedish newspaper asked me a few weeks ago what mark I would give if I were. If the next Swedish presidency refrains from scoring veiled party political points and genuinely focuses on Europe's interests, it might deserve "very good". I say that on behalf of all of us. I wish Sweden a positive future in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Göran Persson, for once again joining us in Parliament and to say to him that in my Group’s opinion, he has passed the test of his country’s first presidency, with the seriousness and skill for which the Swedish government is well known.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that we greatly appreciate his government’s desire to update our relations on issues as important as codecision and Council’s presence in Parliament. I think that we can consider the agreement on public access to documents – which could be improved, but which is an historical first – and the agreement on the information and consultation of workers, which had been on hold for many years, to be significant milestones.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope, of course, that this experience will have helped imbue the Swedish people with a greater sense of affection for the European cause.</p>
<p class="contents">One special feature of this presidency has been its work on sustainable development, which it has not only established as a strategy for the future, but which it has also promoted through its clear and robust argument for ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. This is not only an EU-US issue, it is one that affects the whole world, as the Swedish Prime Minister and myself saw at the Council of the Socialist International last week in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental issue, that of enlargement, was also an area the Swedish presidency focussed on. I should like to thank Mr Poettering, who expressed his support for a proposal that was originally put forward by my colleague, the vice-chairman of our Group, Mr Hänsch. The proposal was not the exclusive property of the PPE-DE Group; it could be said that it came from Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external policy, Sweden maintained its internationalist approach. I feel that where the Middle East is concerned, not only was there a European majority behind the proposal in the Mitchell report, but also, for the first time, we are not only handing over money, we are also playing a leading role, as the Prime Minister pointed out. His presence with Javier Solana in the Middle East was an important step forwards, which we must support, because it is crucial that we make progress with the Mitchell report and move beyond this point of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">In Macedonia too, we are sharing the burden with the Americans – which I think they are beginning to appreciate – and are playing a leading role. The President-in-Office of the Council’s visit to North Korea – which was initially something of a surprise – has also given us greater acknowledgement and greater influence with our American partners and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to highlight the significant work Sweden has carried out in the United Nations with an old friend of ours, Pierre Schiori – whom we greatly miss – who has also done great work on behalf of Europe over the last six months.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to pay particular tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Anna Lindh, who I would say has acted decisively, graciously and with her habitual charm in implementing all of the presidency’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point, to some extent, cast a shadow over the Göteborg Summit, namely the violent demonstrations that those of us who were there witnessed at first hand and also on television. It must be said, first of all, that we fully respect people’s right to demonstrate; this is a citizen’s fundamental right. Many people demonstrated peacefully in Nice and in Göteborg. This is, of course, to be welcomed and appreciated, because it means that Europe’s citizens are beginning to take an interest in what we do. We continually complain that they do not take any notice of us but really, the fact that we are beginning to see active demonstrations about what we are doing is a positive development. Nevertheless, we must differentiate between the violent actions of small minorities who act like commandos and, with a nihilistic and violent attitude, seek to destroy the things for which we are working. I wish to point out to Mr Poettering, that the problem is not whether these people are of the fascist or the antifascist persuasion. The dividing line is between democrats and antidemocrats and we must remember that extremes clash, in politics too. There is no need, then, to discuss whether the demonstrations are fascistic or not. What is crystal clear is that these are people who are acting violently and with scorn for the institutions and for freedom. I feel that given this scenario, we democrats must present a united front. It is not that some of us feel more affected than others about what has happened. We have to adopt a very firm attitude on this.</p>
<p class="contents">My final observation, Madam President, concerns the debate on the future of Europe. You have not managed to include the convention, but I hope that you will continue striving to ensure that we do so under the Belgian presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I should like to begin by congratulating the Prime Minister and his colleagues on a successful presidency. It has been a first presidency for Sweden, and I believe both your government and state can feel a justifiable pride in a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the jobs well done, the one my group applauds most loudly is the clear-sighted, determined commitment which you brought to the enlargement question from Day One of your presidency. It has shone through the presidency, not just since Göteborg, but as an appetite to achieve right from the beginning. That determination has been handsomely rewarded. I know it was a delicate issue. But perhaps the shock Irish referendum result helped the politics of clarification, which I welcome. It is a very important message to the applicant states to say that we want to resolve this issue as soon as we can. The commitment to try to ensure that the first wave can participate in the next European elections as Member States is an important clarification and a very substantial achievement of your presidency. I congratulate you on it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important to acknowledge the progress under your presidency for the second wave of applicant states, the Helsinki states – again a wonderful tribute to your focus and determination. I would urge the Belgian presidency and those that follow to maintain that pace, focus and commitment. You are right, Mr Prime Minister, that we have now got to do some of our homework as well. Not all the transitional issues are just for the applicants, particularly in agriculture, regional policy and cohesion policy. Now we have to start biting some bullets; we have to start focusing on the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Irish referendum will not get in the way of this process. We have until the end of 2002 for Nice to be ratified. It is a matter for the Irish administration to decide how to proceed. But in the interim this should not be used as a reason for taking our foot off the accelerator on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On a matter which has drawn a number of comments, my group fully supports, recognises and celebrates the rights of citizens in a free society to demonstrate. But clearly there were, in Göteborg, anarchic groups whose essential, primary purpose was to undermine democracy itself. You, Mr Prime Minister, more than any of your predecessors at any of these international meetings, went out of your way to meet people, to conciliate, to provide people with places to stay. For the large majority the issue was peaceful and proper demonstration. My group would like to extend its sympathy to the citizens of Göteborg on a very difficult moment in a wonderful host city.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one or two other brief comments. On Macedonia, the presidency, along with Commissioner Patten, Mrs Lindh and Javier Solana have proved the value of developing an embryonic common foreign and security policy. The peace remains delicate. There is a difficult balance between peace and civil war, but the intensity of the European effort and the unity of the European effort is in marked contrast to the disunity of ten years ago. That is not just European progress but a measure of significant progress on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding company law on mergers and takeovers, the presidency has done a wonderful job in fashioning a difficult compromise. I would appeal to Members of this House not to pull the plug on an important measure of economic reform.</p>

Its presence, both here in the Chamber and in the committees, has been very notable and much appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue, transparency and participation are the prerequisites of a functioning democracy. In Göteborg, there was an attempt at dialogue between politicians, demonstrators and a variety of organisations. Unfortunately, it was only a well-intentioned attempt for, in reality, the Heads of State and Government were behind the barriers, and there were no opportunities for civil society and citizens to follow the negotiations concerning the future of all of us. From the closed rooms of this summit culture was born a frustration and impotence also expressed by peaceful demonstrators trying to get their message through to the Heads of State and Government. Unfortunately, a small clique of <span class="italic">agents provocateurs</span> also caused violence and disturbances. The stones they threw were, of course, directed not only against the police but against the whole of democratic society and against all those of us who really tried to get a message across. That may well be felt to be very regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable that the police should have used live ammunition against the <span class="italic">agents provocateurs</span>. An investigation has now been set up to look into how that could be possible in Sweden today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also disappointed at the way in which EU leaders appear to react to the frustration felt at developments in the EU. I also think that no account at all has been taken of the result of the Irish referendum. Instead, an attempt is being made to turn this into an Irish problem, while it is in actual fact, of course, a problem for the whole of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority of the European Parliament too appears now to be making the same mistake, since the Council’s proposal that an open forum should be set up has been rejected and since no substance has been given to the idea of recommending that the next Intergovernmental Conference should be a convention. I really do not understand this reluctance to open up the EU and to enter into a dialogue with people and with civil society. What does the Swedish presidency intend to do in the future to get its colleagues on board and make them understand that this is crucial?</p>
<p class="contents">Where the three ‘E’s were concerned, it was probably on the issue of enlargement that some real fighting spirit was shown and that something was successfully achieved. I cannot emphasise enough how pleased I am that there is now a fixed timetable for the accession procedure. However, I do not know how much energy was put into the issue of sustainable development. In any case, the results were poor in comparison with what might have been expected, for it was a good proposal that the Commission had tabled. I do not know if it has to do with incredible reluctance on the part of the EU’s Heads of State and Government to <span class="italic">understand</span> what sustainable development really entails. How is time now to be found for acquiring grassroots support for a plan and a political process prior to the Rio+10 Conference in South Africa when no practical undertakings have been set out concerning what is to happen to the climate objectives after 2010, how the depletion of fish stocks is to be prevented and how it might be possible to change our current, devastating agricultural policy? EU leaders must assume a global responsibility too. That is something I believe is demanded by the rest of the world and by the people of Europe</p>

That is a picture which fits in quite well with Sweden’s six-month presidency of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">From an organisational point of view, the presidency has operated well. Swedish diplomats have worked assiduously at cobbling together various compromises. From a political point of view, it has had a low profile. <span class="italic">Everything</span> has been done to show that Sweden is a loyal EU member – loyal both to the EU system and towards the large countries that dominate the European Union. This became most obvious of all when the Irish voted against the Treaty of Nice. Mr Persson immediately made it clear that the Irish people would not be allowed to make use of their right to put a stop to more centralised government and supranationalism within the EU. The Treaty of Nice was to remain in place. This is, in practice, an attack on every small country’s right to prevent changes to the Treaty if it wishes to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, compromises have been made at any price. The new rules concerning access to documents were so weak that journalists’ organisations in Europe thought that the current rules were better.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to the presidency, Sweden prioritised enlargement, employment and environmental issues. The presidency has worked hard on enlargement. The pace has been maintained in the negotiations governing how the candidate countries are to be brought into line with the EU’s regulations. This was important if enlargement was not to be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s policy of increased employment is often singled out as a ‘left-wing project’ designed to counteract the right-wing policy of the currency union. The issue was discussed at the Stockholm Summit, but the only practical decision remembered from that occasion was a decision concerning the deregulation of the financial market. That is not much in the way of left-wing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the environmental area, the presidency has had some bad luck. Work on the most important environmental problem – the climate issue – was effectively sabotaged by the new president of the United States. At the Göteborg Summit, there was an opportunity to adopt a sound strategy for sustainable development but, when it came to the crunch, the most radical environmental demands had been removed from the text.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas, the presidency has had great success. In addition to the enlargement negotiations, the decision to remove duties for the poorest countries of all is a clear step forwards. The presidency’s work in combating trafficking in women and in pursuit of peace in the Balkans is also commendable. As usual, however, many of the important decisions are being taken in what is more like secrecy. Sweden has loyally done further work on the militarisation of the EU and thus, in practice, in favour of the abolition of Sweden’s policy of neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">During the period concerned, Sweden and the other Nordic countries have entered into the Schengen Agreement, which is the EU’s most important tool for constructing tough new borders to keep out those who live outside the European Union. This area is a real blot on the Swedish presidency’s copybook. Sweden voted in favour of the proposed fines in the case of transporter’s liability, a proposal that involves a kind of privatisation of asylum policy, which in turn would mean that airlines and other carriers would be penalised if they did not screen out refugees who did not have their papers in order when they made their way to the EU. At the start of the presidency, Mr Persson stood here and talked of a refugee policy characterised by solidarity. We can only regret that, since then, the government has, in practice, taken the opposite line.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words about Göteborg, where small militant groups took the opportunity to attack the police and cause extensive damage. Irrespective of what these groups purport to stand for, this is behaviour that can never be defended. Throwing stones and causing damage is not politics but criminal behaviour. That must not, however, conceal the fact that, in Göteborg, there were also <span class="italic">tens of thousands</span> of people demonstrating in a peaceful and dignified manner for a better Europe than today’s EU with its EMU and Schengen. What 50 000 people do is, in actual fact, more important than what 300 perpetrators of violence get up to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that we must praise the Member States’ determination to introduce concerns about public health and the environment into all the policies imposed by Brussels. It certainly is high time to do so, following mad cow disease and the foot-and-mouth epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the determination to present the Kyoto Protocol and the forthcoming global pact as a panacea is absolute tomfoolery. It is a deal designed for fools, and Europe is the only party at the table – another instance where the white man is allowing himself to be accused of single-handedly destroying the whole planet. Neither China nor India will be taking part, because they gain from development, growth and industrialisation. The US is taking a similar approach, at a time when growth is slowing down against a background of increased international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that you do not voice any criticism to condemn the violent demonstrations that rocked the summit. It is a shame that these tones of indignation are forgotten when it comes to condemning the violence and insecurity that affect millions of our citizens on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of Europe particularly the French government are not even capable of protecting their own people. Their immigration policy, the culture of making excuses, defending the rights of hooligans in the name of human rights, the abolition of the death penalty are all factors which encourage crime, which are favoured over pointing the finger at a handful of left-wing protesters, which, moreover, Mr Barón Crespo rather curiously called fascists unless Mr Barón Crespo had wanted to acknowledge that fascism had found its origins in socialism, all his leaders having been socialist leaders before becoming fascist leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is scandalous that the totalitarian instincts of the European institutions do not offend anyone. Only here could we want to systematically force people back to the ballot box when the result of a vote is not the desired outcome. In 1992, Denmark gave in under threat but Austria quite rightly refused to do so. The Irish people must resist – their ‘no’ vote, <span class="italic">de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span>, has sounded the death knell of the Treaty of Nice. All the people who have not been consulted and who will not be consulted due to a fear of them voting against are lending them their solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have set a new standard or transparency with your home page, but the Swedish signature appended to the regulation on transparency paved the way for the EU now deciding what you must come up with in Stockholm. I asked for the minutes of the meetings on transparency. You did not dare to issue even those, for they would of course show that France, Germany and Spain are opposed to transparency and, were that fact properly to emerge, the three governments would be pressed by their elected representatives and electorate to approve that transparency which Sweden had as an objective. This is an area in which Sweden has committed an historic betrayal.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has also violated the Treaty by introducing qualified majority voting as a method of taking decisions on future changes to the rules governing confidentiality. Before the unlawful adoption of this method on 19 March, measures constituting progress could be adopted by 8 of the 15 countries. That alone is difficult enough. Progress can now be blocked by France, Germany and Spain, even if we can convince all the other 12 countries that progress is what is at issue. Parliament is now bringing legal proceedings against the Council. It is embarrassing for a Swedish presidency to stand accused of a Treaty violation in connection with transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to criticise the police action in Göteborg. Hooded demonstrators threw paving stones at the police and smashed up shops without being caught. Instead, peaceful demonstrators were taken into custody when they arrived at the ferry port. They were not allowed to take part in the peaceful demonstrations. This is something from which we must learn. Enter into dialogue with the peaceful demonstrators who use arguments. Tell the men of violence that throwing a paving stone at someone else’s window may be interpreted as attempted murder. We who wish to demonstrate peacefully must also learn from the battles. People with hoods on must be expelled from demonstrations. It must never be possible to confuse peaceful demonstrators with criminals. There are no excuses for violence, but there are grounds for consideration and reflection. Why have so many young people given up hope of being able to affect decisions by using arguments? Why do the media give more coverage to people with paving stones than to people with arguments? Why, in general, have no European media covered the many serious debates arranged in connection with the Göteborg Summit? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an Austrian, I know that it is by no means an easy task. The objectives were ambitious. The presidency concentrated on a few priorities, in line with the maxim "less is more". Above all, some important progress has been made towards enlargement of the Union. Some agreement has been reached in the chapters on freedom of movement of persons and freedom to provide services, and I would like to offer my congratulations on that success.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one point on which I cannot agree with the commentators in the newspapers. I do not seriously think you can say that establishing concrete data for accession is a great triumph. There are a great many questions that remain to be resolved. Following the Irish referendum, the process of ratifying the Treaty of Nice has become uncertain. The question of whether Nice is a sine qua non for enlargement has been the subject of some debate. But the people of Ireland have given a clear signal that the debate on the future of the Union can no longer be conducted behind closed doors and over the heads of our citizens; the public has to be directly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">One objective of the Göteborg Summit was to work out a strategy for sustainable development. I see the Council's commitment to shift transport to rail and to encourage the full internalisation of external costs as an important clarification of this. The Community will soon have a chance to match its words with deeds. The forthcoming negotiations regarding the expiry of the transit agreement with Austria will provide a good opportunity in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The advantages and benefits to people of cooperation were pushed into the background, while violence and hooliganism came to dominate the reports from the meeting. I know that almost everyone here in the Chamber shares the regret I feel, but it would have been safer for the future of democracy if we could have been in complete agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish presidency ought instead to be remembered for the efforts made regarding enlargement. Securing European freedom and democracy and extending it to include former Communist-occupied Eastern and Central Europe is the absolutely most important task of European cooperation. Hand in hand with this goes a growing debate in which the major issues for the future of European cooperation are presented. Sometimes, the talk is more of how the decision-making processes are to be organised than of <span class="italic">what</span> we are to cooperate on and what the EU must not meddle in. I believe that we all too often talk above people’s heads and at a far remove from their everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland’s ‘no’ to the Treaty of Nice is a lesson for us all and a worry not only for the Irish government. The debate concerning the EU’s future must be conducted in more fundamental and more principled terms. What we say and do here is therefore of less importance than our engaging in greater discussion in our constituencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, if I may take it as an example, it is important now to make the most of the interest aroused by the presidency. As the prime minister also mentioned, there now exists the opportunity to conduct a debate on the future of Europe that engages people’s interest. This means that Sweden must now also tackle the issue of the euro. The common currency is so central to EU cooperation that the Social Democratic Party and the Swedish government must take their share of responsibility for Sweden’s becoming a member of EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">In other countries, there are other issues which must be brought into focus. I think it is important for Europhiles to stand up for a Europe which is more open to the surrounding world and in which free markets prevail. In a number of Member States, Europhiles should take greater responsibility for the fact that enlargement is now becoming a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Swedish presidency was making every effort to be a presidency for the whole of the European Union, what was most important was that we obtain a breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations. The fact that this did not happen with greater enthusiasm and greater courage is not, in the first place, the fault of the Swedish presidency. It was others who were putting the brakes on. I therefore hope that the results achieved through the negotiations have advanced the cause of successful enlargement and that the thorniest issues which are still outstanding – agricultural and regional policy – do not upset or interfere with the decisions taken in Göteborg concerning dates. Let us ensure that these practical achievements loom larger than the stone-throwing and hooliganism on the part of the left-wing extremists. Let us all work together to ensure that the parliament of the street does not win out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They set their seal of approval on the presidency, and a large headline read, ‘Passed with great credit’. I should like to say the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish presidency had three important and major ambitions. There has been a great deal of talk about enlargement. There is no doubt that this issue was handled very well. What is now important in terms of the future – for us in Parliament, for Sweden and for other countries in the Council – is to maintain the pace so that we can meet the objectives we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to employment, the achievement was not perhaps so outstanding. The examples of deregulation were definitely not so outstanding, for many on the right were disappointed that these were insufficient. It was a question of passing on the baton in the important process concerning jobs and growth. A number of new objectives were set. For example, the subjects of family policy and the older labour force were addressed. Only a small part of the latter is currently present in the labour market, and that is something that needs to be changed for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to sustainable development, there are two possible perspectives. The first involves a comparison with the Commission’s document and, clearly, not everything from that perspective was achieved. The second perspective is in relation to the current situation. Clear, unambiguous improvements have been made, and the most important thing is that the environmental issues have been introduced into the Lisbon process. What is the problem today as far as these environmental issues are concerned? Well, the problem is that they are sidelined and that they always come last. They are now to be considered jointly with economic and social policy each year as part of an ongoing process. That, if anything, is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say something about global responsibility. The policies on transport, agriculture and fisheries were singled out. I would also mention transparency, consultation and the provision of information and, in particular, foreign and security policy. On this subject, I should like to say that it is heartening that Sweden has assumed such a large amount of responsibility in this area. It is also pleasing that the Swedish people have understood that we are not talking here about some form of militarisation but, on the contrary, about creating peace and stability in a future Europe and the areas bordering upon it. If Swedish opinion polls are to be believed, there is an incredible amount of support regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the debate about the future. Should there be a convention? Yes, but a convention is not enough. We must broaden the debate so that it extends beyond a convention and is conducted with civil society. If we are to conduct the debate with civil society, we must do what Prime Minister Persson said. We cannot begin with the institutional issues. Instead, we must begin with what it is we want the EU to be doing in five, ten or fifteen years’ time and with how we are to do those things. In that way, the institutional issues come last.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning next to Ireland. We must respect Ireland, but we must also respect the other Member States. There are those who say that we should now call it a day. Should not the Swedish parliament or the other parliaments be allowed to discuss the Treaty of Nice? What kind of view of democracy is it that says that we should pack it in for the moment because the Irish people said no? Are not the other nations presumably also entitled to discuss the issue either in their parliaments or in the particular way they have chosen to? We shall then be able to see what the final result is in 2002, and it will be up to the Irish people to assess the situation at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about the riots. I fully and firmly support what Mr Barón Crespo said. We must draw a distinction between the small number of people who throw stones and those who wish to express a view about continued work within the EU. We must provide the stimulus for a debate with civil society, but we must be tough with those whose only argument is a stone in the hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that, for the first time, many Europeans are aware that there will be representatives from 25 European countries in this House in just three years time. However, we are also aware of the problems arising not just from the pause brought about by the Irish referendum but also from the increasing difficulty of involving the European citizens in planning the future Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My opinion is simple: we must give fresh impetus to the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. The Commission must – and here I am expressing, once again, my total confidence in President Prodi and the Commissioners – demonstrate that it can handle its responsibilities and is capable of working towards a shared vision. Parliament must take greater pride in being the representative of a democratic institution which will soon include half a billion people, at precisely a time when such a large proportion of the public is critical of globalisation. We are the primary example of a supranational power which is still growing, and this, Madam President, must be stressed: this is Europe's contribution to the future of world government.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my appreciation of the determination with which the Swedish presidency has upheld Europe's position on the environment and emphasised the key points of the Kyoto agreements, not just in terms of rules but also in terms of triggering off a new debate within the scientific community on research, technological innovation and industrial competition, placing Europe's position in the context – as Commissioner Wallström said – of the European strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – albeit a day early – I would like to express my best wishes to the Belgian presidency and say that I have every confidence in the presidency of a founding country of Europe. The Belgian presidency will enable us to contribute to that process which will give us a Europe of 25 countries in just three years, but will also bring us a more democratic Europe which is tangibly closer to the principle of subsidiarity, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Europeans, including those who voted against the motion in the Irish referendum, are calling for us to reduce the excessive amount of regulations. Basically, they are demanding that Europe deal more effectively with its strategic priorities and stop wasting so much time on matters of minor importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violence overshadowed the real message that came from the genuine demonstrators outside the summit, which was that people want to be more involved in this process of building the Europe of the future. They want to take part in a real public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The post-Nice process and the Convention are crucial in ensuring that genuine democratic reform can be achieved and that European citizens can play a part in that. We welcome the commitment that was made in Göteborg to move ahead with accession negotiations so that the newest Member States can take part in the 2004 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the establishment of a European sustainable development strategy, albeit a much watered-down version of that originally presented by the Commission, which had contained ambitious targets and concrete measures. Sustainable development is about people: their economic and social needs as well as environmental conservation. Putting this into practice has huge implications. We cannot go on plundering our natural resources and then look to science and technology to try and mend the damage. We need a new approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Persson referred to the importance of establishing the processes. The Cardiff European Summit in 1998 adopted what is referred to as the "Cardiff process", integrating environmental considerations into all areas of EU policy as the first step towards sustainable development. Göteborg did not provide the next major step in practical terms, after the Cardiff process, but the important link is there and the strategy can be built upon. Hopefully we will see this happen and will see progress in the spring summits from now on. This is essential if the EU is to make a major contribution to the Rio+10 world summit in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Another welcome decision at Göteborg was the plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, even without the USA, before the Rio+10 conference. This will send a very clear message, not only to the United States, but also to the rest of the world, about our commitment to this goal and our determination to combat climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Vandalism, a blind destructive frenzy and criminal violence, all of which should be condemned, and my Group most certainly does condemn them. We must never allow anything like this to happen again. But people who want to make their views known, who want to exercise their right to demonstrate or who want to protest against political decisions should still be able to do so peacefully without any restrictions in future, just as some 20 000 peaceful demonstrators also did in Göteborg.</p>
<p class="contents">Committed citizens will continue to see European summits as a political opportunity to express their ideas and expectations, and that is a good thing, because we need to take the public's views into account more when building a democratic Europe. Politicians and governments should no longer be allowed to sweep over the heads of the public and ignore their sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish presidency in particular has made great efforts in this direction. It has made an effort to tackle the problem of the democratic deficit in Europe, and we really must recognise that. Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat disappointing. However, that cannot be laid at the door of the Swedish government alone – all governments have to be held to account here.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to a public debate on the future of Europe, that debate should be a wide-ranging one. It needs to be purposeful and result-oriented. Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, you know that we in this House want a convention to prepare the next intergovernmental conference. We have done some preliminary work here, and it will now be the job of the Belgian presidency to initiate this convention before Laeken. I very much welcome the fact that there are already proposals on the table to extend the agenda and to address further issues in the debate on the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

'Strange' because Sweden's various governments have always placed transparency at the heart of European politics, and Sweden has now found itself running the least transparent body, the body to which all the decisions, even the most unimportant, fall, thanks to a false idea of the supremacy of the intergovernmental method. Mr President-in-Office, I hope that your country and you yourself will reflect on this point. When Parliament requests more powers, it does so also in the name of that representativeness which it undoubtedly has and which the governments, in that form – not in general but in that form – do not have. Therefore, from that point of view, Göteborg could be a useful lesson for those governments that are still hesitant about a slightly different vision of Europe, a vision which many Members in this House share.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Swedish presidency on one point in particular, and that is the undertaking assumed – which nobody has singled out because it happened rather on the quiet – regarding the International Criminal Court. The Swedish presidency led the Fifteen to adopt a very important common position, a strong position in favour of ratifying not only the International Criminal Court but also the campaign and, three days ago, it also ratified the Court's Statute. This is an undertaking to which I would like to pay tribute because, in this way, Sweden has contributed to the creation of something which, with Milosevic's arrest, is increasingly close to being achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one thing that I am glad to see you did not manage to do, and that is to decide the locations – mathematically, Italian style – of the agencies, maybe removing the possibility of locating the Food Agency in Parma and giving it to Helsinki instead. This would have been a mistake which, I am glad to say, did not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, "Well done" to the Swedish presidency for its achievements with regard to both climate change and the Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swedish presidency will be remembered for this violence and this contempt, the contempt with which European leaders have treated the result of the referendum in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The Göteborg Summit has shown that the European Union was almost becoming a Forbidden City, as foreign to the people of Europe as the Manchu dynasty to the most remote Mongolian tribes and treating them with just as much contempt. The EU is totally indifferent to the peoples’ sovereign views remember, if you will, the ‘no’ vote of the people of Denmark of 28 September 2000, which was treated with equal contempt. I believe that the European Union is in the process and I know that this will perhaps cause some shock of reviving a colonial style approach towards the nations within it, with the slight difference that, in this case, the colonial power intends to develop colonisation rather than to initiate it, as has been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the reaction of the Irish people, who, for a long time, have had their fingers burnt by history, heralds a general feeling of rebellion amongst the people of Europe – to face up to this new type of almost endogenous neo-colonialism that is emerging, which has wanted to rule over them since Maastricht, Amsterdam and now Nice, and to bring them the benefits of an essentially healthy undertaking namely Europe – whether they like it or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, this same Council made a serious error when, in paragraph 4 of the presidency conclusions, it appeared to link the decision on enlargement to the fate of the Treaty of Nice. This is an error of legal, political and moral judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an error of legal judgment, because, as the President of the Commission stated on 21 June 2001, 'the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is not legally necessary for enlargement to take place’ and, moreover, Mr Poettering, this may also be the reason why the President of the Commission is not here today. In any case, I shall not go back to this point because, again from a legal point of view, no one has since contradicted what Mr Prodi said.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an error of political judgment because, from a political point of view, the Treaty of Nice is only essential for enlargement for those wishing to build a European ‘super state’. Do they wish to combine the super state, European enlargement and the Treaty of Nice, therefore, at the risk of causing all these projects to fail together?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is an error of moral judgment, because, by upholding the statement made by the General Affairs Council of 11 June 2001, the Göteborg Council showed utter contempt for the democratically expressed opinion of a nation, which shows the Europe that it hopes to achieve in a strange light.</p>

The final balance is very positive. I also welcome the support that you continue to pledge with regard to the Belgian presidency. Perhaps you will allow me to draw your attention once more to a few elements.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all enlargement. Enormous efforts are being made on that score by the Central and Eastern European countries, but the question of whether the European Union is ready for enlargement is becoming ever more pressing, of course. For example, if I consider how long it has taken us to adopt a common position on the free movement of persons, I am a little apprehensive about discussing far more complex issues, such as agriculture or the funding of the EU. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that the European Union is ready on time. But it is also important to prepare our own public opinion for future events. That is not only necessary in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in the European Union, as we have witnessed during the Irish referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">It is great to have Mr Milosevic in The Hague, but I do hope that the money pledged will also be paid out swiftly to the population in the former Yugoslavia, for we need to offer prospects, particularly in those regions. We must also ensure that the European Union takes steps in Macedonia to promote the peaceful co-existence of the two nations and the prevention of any future explosions in the Balkans in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that, where Russia is concerned, our relationship with Mr Putin should not purely be amicable. We should, above all, criticise him for the inadequate enforcement of human rights and, especially, for compromising the freedom of the press. On that score, our message to Mr Putin should be crystal clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the energy policy was a minor failure on the part of the Swedish presidency. It is extremely regrettable that the French/German axis has caused the derailment of the liberalisation process within the European energy market. This appears to me to be a major task for the Belgian presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And the best way to deal with stones and anti-democracy is to defend our own European democracy, explain to our citizens why we need Europe, enter into a debate with them and show them concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">My group Chairman has already expressed thanks, and I should like to echo this, in respect of Mr Persson, Mr Danielsson and Mrs Lindh, who have recently cooperated with us in a very concrete manner to give shape to a number of matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words on Europe’s underlying rationale and on a matter that our citizens understand very well, namely foreign policy. Citizens realise that Europe was, in itself, probably the most successful conflict prevention project of the last century, and they also realise that Europe can contribute towards peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, under the Swedish presidency and in close cooperation with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana, we have witnessed how, concerning a number of important issues, Europe has played a more pivotal role, as it were. That was the case in the ‘Everything but Arms’ sector, which represented a movement towards a more open Europe in trading terms to achieve a world trade round in which development was central. That was also the case in our protest against the American ‘missile defence system’ initiative and our belief that we need to invest in conflict prevention more efficiently and at an earlier stage. That is similarly the case now that we are on the brink of a war in the Middle East. Despite this, we have tried to bring both parties around the negotiating table, thus considerably strengthening Europe’s presence in recent months. And that was also the case with regard to possibly the most sensitive and most complex problem for Europe, FYROM/Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on conflict prevention, because I am very well aware that the Swedish presidency has exerted a great deal of pressure in a direction which appeals to us greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">We could, of course, invest enormous amounts in technologies in the hope that that would provide us with a safety shield, as it were. I do not deny the fact that we need new technological developments, but this American initiative is not the right way forward. What we need to do is to invest in diplomacy, conflict prevention and citizens’ networks and to enter into all those development aid and trade commitments which, together, create stability in the world. In that way, we can prevent those dozens of conflicts which are taking place at the moment from continuing to spread.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of thinking in terms of foreign policy is a new security concept. In my opinion, the Swedes have helped shape that new security concept in Europe. This is a European value which, I believe, is appropriate and which suits us very well. I should like to thank you for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that that attention is justified. The headline of today’s <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</span>, which reads: “Gewalt statt Waffenruhe im Nahen Osten” [violence instead of a cease-fire in the Middle East], illustrates this.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of the Palestinian <span class="italic">intifada</span> (uprising) is not yet in sight. At the same time, the tension between Israel and Syria is again rising dangerously. There is therefore no chance of a return to the so-called peace process in the Middle East, despite all recent diplomatic efforts on the part of America and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the options left to those mediating parties? The conclusions of the European Council in Göteborg do not really address this cardinal issue. They excel in wishful thinking. Upbeat terms such as “cooling-off period” and “additional trust-building measures” are supposed to ward off the deep-rooted violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the United States and the European Union therefore leave Israel and the Palestinian Authority to their own devices? Not at all! What is important is that both mediating parties are aware of their diplomatic and military powers. The High Representative, Mr Solana, has broached the subject of essential distribution of roles. Without beating about the bush, he recognises, in his Middle East reports at the Göteborg Summit, the United States’s key position in the required resumption of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">This sincere statement causes the High Representative to underline the importance of permanent, mutual consultation, thus making ‘our efforts complementary’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely this objective that requires balanced, European action in the region. That is why I would ask the Council and Commission to inform me of the specific conditions they attach to the considerable support they lend to the Palestinian Authority. Surely, at this moment in time, adequate control of violence must be the primary condition. For precisely that condition will help break the present deadlock in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring, of course, to the violence displayed by the demonstrators and to relations with the United States. With regard to the latter, although it is true that points of disagreement still remain, on capital punishment, for example, on the Kyoto protocol and on the anti-missile shield, considerable progress has clearly been made, Mr President, on the joint declaration on the Middle East and on the joint approach to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the violence, I think that we must make a clear distinction between displays of violent action – and violence must be eradicated because in a democracy ideas cannot be advocated by force – and the message that was conveyed in the course of the protests. In the interest of everyone, Mr President, globalisation must be a ship that has more crew members and fewer shipwrecks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to internal issues, we must make a clear distinction between promises and the reality of the situation. I think that the repeated wish to maintain the timetable for negotiations on enlargement is a factor, but I also feel, Mr President, that the problem of not knowing how this accession process is to be financed or which of the candidate countries will be in the first wave of accessions is significant. It is crucial that we bear in mind that our project for integrating Europe does not only gain legitimacy once every five years when elections to the European Parliament are held. Our project must be given legitimacy each and every day. To this effect, it is not enough for there to be greater and closer police coordination, or for the Commission to set a course for our integration project. What is crucial is that we reach agreement on a common vision of the Europe that we want. No such agreement exists today and yet it is essential if we are to ensure that this project is more what it has been until now: it must be much more the fruit of the dreams and the enthusiasm of our citizens than of the will of our leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that conciliations were finally concluded, but not perhaps at the ambitious level that Parliament would have liked to see. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the Swedish presidency really has sought to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development is an important step in taking the environment into account in European policy. Strengthening the ecological pillar in sustainable development is also essential since when sustainable development is monitored year by year, we have to be able to set clear targets for the ecological pillar to make this monitoring possible. We have to have measurable goals, quantitative and qualitative targets, sufficient perspectives on how the environmental situation can be monitored to enable us also to tackle the threats we face successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion the Swedish presidency otherwise succeeded very well, although it would have been good to see a decision on the Food Authority reached at the Göteborg Summit, as work on this should begin immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Council in Göteborg was generous in response to our predicament and I welcome its willingness to help the Irish Government find a way forward. I regret that it is not going to be easy. With a little more effort by the political establishment in Ireland, a 'yes' vote could easily have been obtained but now that the referendum has taken place, many people, including supporters of the Nice Treaty, will be reluctant to overturn it. It also must be said that the recent remarks of Mr Prodi in the Irish media to the effect that enlargement can proceed even if Nice is not ratified, unfortunately adds to the confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my major concern arises because of the existence of a strong eurosceptic core at the heart of the Irish government. While the Taoiseach was speaking to our European partners inside the Council in an attempt to repair the damage inflicted on our reputation, his finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, was outside describing the Irish rejection of the Nice Treaty as a remarkable and healthy development.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to take the opportunity of warning the Council and the Commission to be careful, as Mr McCreevy's continued eurosceptic approach could well be an indication of his intention to provoke another row with the EU over Ireland's budgetary policy in the run-up to a possible autumn Irish general election. I hope that the ratification of the Nice Treaty proceeds successfully, and that when we revisit the issue in Ireland, we will have a different result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Notwithstanding that a handful of extremist demonstrators tried to spoil it in Göteborg, we will ultimately look back on solid achievements under your presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I say the words "presidency of the Council" advisedly because it is not, of course, the presidency of the Union. Every institution has its own president. We have Mrs Fontaine, the Commission has Mr Prodi, the Council has a Member State government by rotation. There is actually no such thing as a presidency of the Union, yet every presidency often presents itself as the President of the Union. This contributes to a feeling in public opinion that puts too much weight on the presidency. Expectations are raised too high. But when you take over the presidency you are not assuming executive office, you are taking the chairmanship of one of the institutions with an inherited agenda for a very short period of time, and people expect too much of it. That is why there are sometimes disappointments at the end of the presidency. Less so this time – and that is because you have done so well – but I would advise future presidencies not to build themselves up into something that they are not, and to get down to the solid work that is necessary for what that post really means.</p>
<p class="contents">Your greatest success has been in accelerating the enlargement negotiations and it now looks as though all the candidate countries except Romania and Bulgaria could well be in by the time of the next European elections. That means that this Parliament will have at least 732 Members, possibly more. It will be many more if there is any slippage in that timetable, because any country that has not signed its accession treaty by the beginning of 2004, but comes in during the next Parliament, will have its MEPs added on top of the 732. That is going to cause huge administrative and financial problems for this Parliament. We will do our best to deal with that, but I suspect that, if there are problems, we will get the blame in public opinion for a decision that was taken by the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is of course the fault of the Swedish presidency. On the contrary, the acceleration of the enlargement negotiations should help in that respect. But it is something that all Member States, and all of us, should bear in mind as we move to the Convention to prepare the next Intergovernmental Conference. I hope that it will be a proper Convention, and that the next Intergovernmental Conference is not prepared by the usual small group of foreign policy advisers, but by a wider representative body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly pleased that the presidency succeeded in putting sustainable development at the core of European politics. It is extremely important that the European Union is perceived by our citizens as more than an economic exercise and a free market because that, without any doubt, will alienate them further from the notion of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to bear in mind that economic integration and getting the economy of Europe right is important. It is equally important to bear in mind that there cannot be economic development in a modern economy without a strong social dimension. I would argue that sustainable development and employment are part and parcel of the social dimension of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to congratulate the Swedish presidency on putting the notion of conflict prevention on the agenda in a much stronger way than up to now. Given the traditions of the Swedish people, this is obviously an area very close to their hearts. It is very close to the heart of the people of Ireland who, unfortunately, recently rejected the Nice Treaty, precisely because they misunderstood to some extent the nature of the European Union and what we are attempting to do in relation to the Rapid Reaction Force.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the presidency has been a success and that these issues have been put on the agenda. It is now up to us in this Parliament and future presidencies to develop them further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, I would like to stress a few points which I feel are extremely important for Europe's growth: pensions and the project for financial sustainability, the new cycle of negotiations on international trade reform, the issues relating to public health and a strict relationship between the use of natural resources and economic growth. On this point, for example with regard to some of the areas related to agriculture, we might have wished for more ambition, partly because the current fear is that some of the situations which have been consolidated within the European Union, specifically those relating to the agricultural sector, will be sacrificed to enlargement matters.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to food safety in the context of enlargement too, in our opinion, the tendency is sometimes to subdue rather than aim towards a way of working which will provide guarantees to the consumer. We are still too fresh, if you will pardon the expression, from the crises we have had in recent years – dioxins, mad cow disease – not to see food safety as a priority in the political decisions we have to take over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, on a political note, we feel that, in some areas, the relationship between the Council and the European Parliament has not been what we would have wished it to be, and on extremely important political matters such as the relationship with Russia and the space shield, for example, we have seen alarming acceleration. If we do not have an adequate debate in Strasbourg, we will be in danger of creating a series of points of no return which could cause deep rifts, particularly in a politically sensitive period such as this one, where some countries – such as Italy, Spain and Great Britain – have stable governments but in others – such as France and Germany – things will change every time there is an election. Therefore, some positions might be subject to pressure which is due more to electoral positions than overall European positions.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the European Parliament must have the extremely important role of redressing the balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it confirmed the timetable for enlargement, as the European Parliament hoped it would, by moving the goal to complete negotiations forward to the end of 2002. This is wonderful news! On the other hand, at the same time, the Heads of State and Government decided to disregard the implications of the Irish ‘no’ vote at the latest referendum. Yet, this ‘no’ vote casts major doubts over the timetable for ratification, and perhaps even as to whether ratification will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the Treaty of Nice to be ratified, we must now wait for the national elections in Ireland and for these elections to produce a victory in Dublin of a more united majority than the current majority on this issue, and for this majority to be willing to gamble its credibility on this now highly sensitive area. We also need the new leaders to find persuasive arguments to convince the Irish people to change their minds. Those telling us today that this will be a mere formality are the same people who were burying their heads in the sand before the recent referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, for the candidate countries, the Treaty of Nice is no longer the key to the door of the European Union it has now become the lock, a stiff lock, firmly bolted into place by the Irish people and there are no guarantees that it will be reopened. That is why opening accession negotiations on the basis of the current treaties, in other words, the Treaty of Amsterdam, is the only thing that can guarantee that the timetable promised at Göteborg will be respected. That is what Mr Prodi attempted to say and he was made to keep quiet. The policy of burying one’s head in the sand is not the right strategy to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional reform still has to be carried out, whether or not we have the Treaty of Nice. The European Parliament believes that the reform can only form part of a constitutional approach. In the meantime, however, it is our duty to tell the candidate countries that the only way for them to ensure that the proposed timetable will be respected is by negotiating on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam. If the Treaty of Nice is finally ratified by the autumn of 2002, there will still be time to support it. If it is not ratified, enlargement can still go ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Persson talked about sustainable development which has social, economic and ecological dimensions. I share his view. I agree that sustainable development should be added to the Lisbon criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholehearted agree with everything that has been written in this connection, for example to the effect that trends which threaten the future quality of our lives must be reversed. I also agree with the statement that ‘sustainable development will present significant economic opportunities. This has the potential to unleash a new wave of technological innovation and investment, generating growth and employment.’</p>
<p class="contents">But, Mr President, paper can wait. The ink with which these fine conclusions were written was not even dry when, for the discussion of two matters of environmental legislation last Monday, the entire Council cried off. I actually wonder whether those Prime Ministers speak on their own behalves when they reach those conclusions, and I also wonder whether they actually follow what has been agreed in Europe in their weekly cabinet meetings? Also, do they ever stop to think whether those conclusions are consistent and in line with what they tell each other in the first six months, or once every six months?</p>
<p class="contents">The moral of the story – I am addressing the Swedish presidency, but this applies equally to all other presidencies – is that the European Parliament, but also the European citizen, cannot be fooled any longer. We are actually fed up with one fine declaration every six months. We also want you to proceed with the agenda and add a concrete dimension to the issues. We have heard too much idle talk.

There are many positive things to be said about, for example, its approach to enlargement towards the East and to the issues surrounding transparency, as well as about its efforts for peace in the Balkans. I only have a short time in which to speak, so allow me to address two issues concerning which the results have unfortunately, in my view, been relatively poor.</p>
<p class="contents">One area in which more ought to have been achieved is, of course, the European Union’s sustainable development strategy. The result from Göteborg was, in the main, a framework decision with extremely little content. I can only hope that, even once the presidency is over, the prime minister will continue to push on with these issues and ensure that we obtain lucid content, clear objectives and timetables when it comes to taking the long-term view in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that the prime minister particularly mentioned relations with the Third World, which are naturally a very important part of the work on sustainability. We cannot bring about sustainable development without adopting a global approach from the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that the results have been poorest when it comes to the debate on the future. I do not think that Sweden took the opportunity it in actual fact had as the country holding the presidency to discuss in depth not only the content and direction of the European Union’s future, but also the organisation. I believe that things have, in a way, been made too easy for those who follow. I have heard more from Belgium on this issue, before the country takes over the presidency, than I have heard from Sweden. That is serious, because it is important that we get to have a debate on this issue, especially with a view to transparency, democratisation and the business of securing grassroots support. It is important for Europe, but it is important, above all, for Sweden for, there, we still have a debate which very often comes down to a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ to the European Union and which is not focused upon the content of the Union or upon the way it should look as an organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore only hope that, during the next few months and as part of the troika’s work, the prime minister will play an active part when Belgium now most certainly pushes ahead with these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The public finds it incomprehensible that although important legislative projects like the one on increased compensation arrangements for overbooking in passenger air transport was negotiated in Council, they have not been adopted. It is just as incomprehensible that important legislative initiatives like the creation of a single European sky are already blocked within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, this would have been a good example of an area where the Council could have done something, because everyone knows that disputes like the one over Gibraltar cannot be settled at ministerial level, between transport ministers. It is a job for the top man, but in this case the top men have failed on two counts. I do hope at least that the minutes of the Göteborg Summit are factually correct. I say that because the Göteborg minutes say that the Council hopes that this dispute over Gibraltar can be settled over the next few weeks. So we are keen to see if a result will be forthcoming at least two weeks after the Swedish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I also have a request for the Commission, an urgent appeal in fact. The Commission absolutely must adopt the legislative initiative on the creation of a single European sky before the summer break and forward it to the Council and Parliament. You know as well as we do that the many delays, the incidences of planes circling above the ground, are not just annoying for the public, because of delays in reaching their holiday destinations, and because of business appointments that cannot be kept. It is also expensive. You know just as well as we do that the ridiculous combustion of air fuel in the sky is environmentally unacceptable. That is why we need a sensible European system to bring an end to these delays. We look forward to seeing your proposal on this before the summer is out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I read with concern in the conclusions to the Göteborg Summit in particular that the Commission is to proceed with its plans to propose a framework to ensure that "by 2004 the price of using different modes of transport better reflects costs to society". This clearly reflects the principle of infrastructure charging which has been promoted by the Commission since the publication in July 1998 of its White Paper on fair and efficient pricing in transport, subsequently approved in the Costa Neves report, which Parliament approved in January.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are anything but fair and efficient, especially as far as road transport is concerned. The Commission's own research shows, for example, that the per kilometre cost of running a car in the UK under infrastructure charging would increase by 97% by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely we have learned some lessons from the fuel price protests which brought many Member States to a standstill last autumn. Road users are already being forced to pay through the nose to subsidise other forms of transport, in particular the United Kingdom, and the Commission's proposals will only aggravate this. Despite several years of study and consultation, even the so-called "experts" within this field admit that the science involved in so-called social marginal costing – the process by which these charges are set – is untested and uncertain. Charging people off the road will not encourage the general public to change their travel habits, it will merely provoke widespread dissent and anger. The road user should not be the target of a witch hunt.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should be free to set their own tax regimes and decide their own priorities for infrastructure charging and improvements. I urge every Member of this Parliament to acknowledge the horrendous impact this would have and encourage them to join me in opposing any such proposals every step of the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we judge the results of the summit on the basis of which strategies were supported, the most substantial success achieved was the introduction of a step-by-step procedure for monitoring environmental policy with the annual control introduced by the spring summit of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the requirement to devise national strategies and coordinate the policies of the Member States will be particularly important for countries lagging behind in this sector. We might also describe the initial objectives and measures defined in four sectors – climatic change, safeguarding sustainability in transport, dealing with public health risks and responsible management of natural resources – as being of major importance. I say "might" because no specific concomitant measures on pollution management costs aimed at individuals or companies were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the summit was clearly backwards in coming forwards in protecting public health, a sector in which there are huge risks; one need only cite mad cows and foot-and-mouth. Just yesterday, the first confirmed case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was reported in Greece. The summit was also backwards in coming forwards in the biotechnology sector, where the European Union basically needs to get moving and apply a technology which will offer important advantages to society in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">So the summit clearly failed to come up to expectations and consequently I would not say that it was a landmark summit. However, it is a starting point for moving from declarations and intentions to the application of an integrated environmental protection policy closely bound up with social and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the summit may have announced that the objectives of environmental sustainability are to be incorporated but, unfortunately, it failed to adopt any timetables, binding indicators, objectives or specific measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me it symbolised the growing distance between the leaders and the led. I regret that the summit came to the conclusion that it should set aside the Irish referendum result and proceed with business as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">The referendum in Ireland gave us an opportunity to sit back and think about the way in which Europe develops. The purpose, apparently, of the Nice Treaty was to provide for the enlargement of the European Union to include the new democracies. It is the paramount duty of all politicians in Europe to achieve that as soon as possible. However, I disagree with the President of the Commission, who wrote in <span class="italic">The Wall Street Journal</span> last week that Nice was essential for enlargement. Nice is not essential for enlargement. We could, within the accession treaties, make the necessary adjustment to QMV, voting rights, the number of MEPs and so on, for each country which accedes to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take this chance now of providing for the peoples of Europe, represented by their national MPs and by their Members of the European Parliament, by establishing not a Convention, but a parliamentary conference. That parliamentary conference should prepare the ground for the next Intergovernmental Conference. Above all, it should begin to identify the sort of choices that Europe needs to make for the future in the economy, social policy, the environment, transport, and the budget – the sort of Europe that the two great political families, the centre left and centre right of politics in Europe, actually look for. That would provide, at the European elections of 2004, a real choice between the proposals of the centre left and the proposals of the centre right. That would make the European elections meaningful and would actually accord with the views of most people in this House that the business-as-usual approach, the top-down approach, cannot be sustained any longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Persson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I would like to comment briefly on a few speeches, but let me first express my warm gratitude for the praise which the Swedish presidency has received from various party groups in Parliament. I would like to extend thanks to everyone who has worked hard and enthusiastically for the Swedish presidency. The group of senior civil servants led by Under-Secretary of State Lars Danielsson should also, of course, receive particular mention in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to say something about the demonstrations in Göteborg: We are democrats. We support the right to demonstrate. We are against violence. We condemn anyone who uses violence to subvert political processes. What happened in Göteborg was that we had a wide-ranging democratic dialogue with people of different opinions to ourselves. That was good, as the point of democracy is to be able to get together and exchange views. What happened beyond that was that there was a relatively small group of hooligans who are very active internationally, whom we have seen before in other circumstances and whom I fear we may see again in the future. They must be treated very firmly by the forces of law and order, who did an excellent job in Göteborg, by the way. These militant hooligans often call themselves anti-fascists. That is their own way of describing themselves. I must say that I have never seen anything more fascistic than their methods of operation. Their whole way of addressing politics is fascistic. Their whole way of using violence is the way of fascism. When I use the <span class="italic">fascist </span>label for these <span class="italic">communists</span>, this is in fact to show that both extremes have merged. We have seen many examples of this before in European politics. Perhaps we will see further examples, but never let us as democrats be pitted against one another in this context. We must present a united front against violence, fascism and communism. That is the lesson to be learned from Göteborg.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that the leader of the PPE-DE Group, Mr Poettering, is not present. It would have been valuable if he could have listened directly to these humble views from a representative of the Council. I hope, even so, that he will be able to read these simple thoughts in the minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">In his elegant and well-formulated speech, Mr Cox touched on a matter to which I attach great importance, and that is the conciliation which we have achieved on company takeovers. I would be extremely concerned if Parliament did not support the conciliation results. This is a unique event and something which will have fundamental consequences for Parliament’s work in the future. I therefore urge Parliament to show support, in the way described by Mr Cox, for the conciliation process that has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that I value what Mr Van Velzen said about the tendency we have, and to which I referred in my introduction, to see the candidate countries as the ones facing the greatest difficulties. It is clearly difficult for them to adapt to the demands we set, but <span class="italic">their</span> reform process is run with energy and clear goals. As we approach the final chapter of the negotiations, I believe that it is within the circle of the Member States that it will be most difficult to formulate positions. In our experience during our short presidency, <span class="italic">that</span> is what we had to spend most time on. I fully support the view that we have difficult chapters ahead of us, for example agricultural and regional policy, matters which naturally also form the foundation for the structure which we currently have in European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that Mr Corbett from the UK<span class="italic"> </span>made a very good point about the character of the presidency. I would warn against the development we are now seeing whereby every time a new country holds the presidency of the European Council, there is a belief that the Union must be fundamentally changed. It is incredibly important that those who lead the Council see their task as a <span class="italic">continuing</span> responsibility which means that one presidency interlocks with another. Policy must remain stable and, if appropriate, be taken forwards. However, the guiding principle must be the common interests of the Union, and the national aspect must therefore be pushed into the background. This is the way we have operated. Some have seen this as boring, but I am convinced that it is a necessary approach if the working method of a rotating presidency is to survive in the future. I strongly support what Mr Corbett said.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman regrets the lack of debate on the future of Europe during the Swedish presidency. Let me say directly to him that I have heard this before. What exactly have we been doing during the Swedish presidency? Foreign policy, environmental policy, enlargement of the EU that is as much of a debate about the future as you can have. However, by debate on the future of Europe, some mean the Union’s structures and often add that you have to have some sort of federal impulse to qualify as a debater of the future in the EU. I myself do not share this view, but believe that the debate on the future must now address what we want to achieve. So let us gradually, during the Belgian presidency, the Spanish presidency and the Danish presidency, enter into discussions as to what this political will requires in the form of expanded institutions within the EU. This is the way we should look at it, and that is why what we have contributed during the Swedish presidency has been to the very highest degree a debate about the future. The issues are enlargement, foreign and security policy and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say to Mr Bradbourn that I am grateful for his words as, from his Conservative point of view, he put his finger on an important point. It has, of course, been said that the environmental conclusions in Göteborg should not be detailed and should not in any way be compulsory or challenging. The criticism from Mr Bradbourn to the effect that they go too far and are too detailed shows, however, that they are exactly that. They <span class="italic">are </span>detailed. All those who criticise these conclusions for not going far enough have, in actual fact, been answered quite well and clearly by his speech. I am grateful for Mr Bradbourn’s contribution, but I do not share his view. That is more or less where I stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally say that Mr Dell’Alba brought up what may prove to be the biggest event of the six months of the Swedish presidency. What I am spontaneously thinking of, namely the extradition of Milosevic to The Hague, is not of course a direct consequence of action by the Swedish presidency, but it is a consequence of the firm action by the European Union and others on this issue. It is a consequence of a value-based approach to relations in terms of foreign policy. It is a consequence of our promoting human rights. It may well be that the extradition of Milosevic to The Hague will in future be described as the vital, major event which changed the character of foreign policy, as those who turn on their citizens or others or who wage war on ethnic grounds – wherever in the world it may be – are observed and monitored, made to answer for their actions and held accountable before internationally united political opinion, based on values of democracy and human rights. The extradition of Milosevic to The Hague is a major political event and a victory for all those who believe in a foreign policy based on common values.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for such excellent cooperation during the Swedish presidency.</p>
