<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamandouros,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Ombudsman</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament for the first time since the historic enlargement of the European Union and to present the European Ombudsman's annual report for 2003. I took up my duties as Ombudsman on 1 April 2003, following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman. This report therefore covers his three final months in office, as well as my first nine months of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to Mr Söderman for his excellent work and many achievements on behalf of European citizens, foremost of which is the establishment of the European Ombudsman as an effective, dynamic and well-respected institution, promoting openness, accountability and good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing Commission for all its constructive work for citizens during its term of office and in particular to thank Vice-President Loyola de Palacio for her collaboration and support. I look forward to working with Vice-President-designate Margot Wallström, whom I hope to be meeting soon in her new role.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report for 2003 records the progress made by the institution of the European Ombudsman in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making itself better known to citizens, including, not least, the efforts to prepare the institution for enlargement and equip it to reach out to citizens in 25 Member States in the 21 Treaty languages.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, the total number of complaints received by the European Ombudsman was 2 436, representing a 10% increase on the previous year. In almost 70% of cases handled during 2003, help was provided to the complainant by opening an inquiry into the case, transferring it to a competent body or giving concrete advice on where to turn for prompt and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">As I already indicated when appearing before the Committee on Petitions in April this year, the upward trend in complaints is continuing. In the first 10 months of 2004, there has been an unprecedented 54% rise as compared to the same period last year. I am confident that this does not reflect worsening administrative behaviour by European institutions, but rather an increased awareness by citizens of how to exercise their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With the support and encouragement of Members of this House, we have made strenuous efforts in recent years to raise awareness among citizens of their right to complain. I am convinced that these efforts have contributed to the increased use that is being made of our services and was heartened to see that Mr De Rossa's excellent report acknowledges these endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, 180 decisions closing cases following inquiries were made. In 47% of cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration. Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of an explanation from the institutional body concerned. In 28% of cases, the inquiry resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the full satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution. When a friendly solution was not possible, the case was closed with a critical remark or a draft recommendation was made.</p>
<p class="contents">Nine new draft recommendations were made during 2003, including one that led the Council to come into line with Parliament and the Commission by giving candidates in recruitment competitions access to their own marked examination scripts. If an institutional body fails to cooperate, I can put the matter before this House in a special report. I am happy to state that I saw no need to make such a special report concerning any of the cases closed during 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Five new own-initiative investigations were launched in 2003, including an inquiry concerning the integration of persons with disabilities, particularly as regards measures to ensure that they are not discriminated against in their relations with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Two own-initiative inquiries were closed with positive results during the year. One of these led the Commission to change its tender procedures by allowing unsuccessful bidders time to challenge contract award decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of these successes could not have been achieved without the active cooperation of other institutions in answering complaints rapidly, fully and correctly. The 2003 report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to the Ombudsman's proposals and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">When I address Members and officials of the European Union institutions and bodies in person, as I did eight times in 2003, I am keen to underline the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints. I would like to think that the Ombudsman can be seen as a valuable source of information for all institutions that wish to improve the quality of their administration. The ultimate goal for all of us must be to provide the best possible service to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Ombudsman institutions and similar bodies now exist at national level throughout the European Union, including all the new Member States. The sole exception is Italy. Cooperation with these institutions and with their regional equivalents plays a vital role in improving the service to citizens through the exchange of information and experiences, the transfer of complaints between the European, national and regional levels and the provision of information to citizens about their rights under European law and about how to exercise and defend those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The network of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and national and regional Ombudsmen throughout Europe, which comprises some 90 offices in 30 countries, was strengthened and intensified in 2003 with four high-level meetings in Athens, Valencia, Warsaw and Strasbourg. Such cooperation is reinforced through regular communication initiatives by the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">When I took office in April 2003, I committed myself to reaching out to citizens in every Member State, to inform them about the work of the European Ombudsman. I therefore visited many Member States in 2003 and by 1 May 2004 had visited all ten accession countries. I met national and regional Ombudsmen, high government officials and members of the judiciary and presented my work to non-governmental organisations, chambers of commerce, universities, the press and EU representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The regular Eurobarometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombudsman, which often increases after a visit. Hits on the Ombudsman's website tend to confirm this. The sharp rise in the number of complaints and, indeed, the number of admissible complaints further bears this out. These information visits are complementary to the regular press and communication activities of the European Ombudsman which, in 2003, included over 80 speeches by the Ombudsman and the staff of the institution and a press release on average every nine working days.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the increased workload for the institution in terms of complaint handling, communications activities and liaison with national and regional Ombudsmen in the enlarged Europe, I proposed an increase in resources for the institution in the 2005 budget. I am grateful to Parliament for having responded positively to that call, thereby allowing me to continue to serve citizens effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions for their support and constructive proposals, as set out in Mr De Rossa's report, and to put on record my appreciation of the work and positive contribution of that committee in the previous Parliament and of its then chairman, Mr Gemelli.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the issues identified in this report will have to be addressed by the institutions, including, not least, access to documents, the infringement procedure and the Ombudsman's Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me react to some issues that are of direct concern to me as Ombudsman. Firstly, we should not underestimate the importance of transparency in winning the trust of citizens. As the De Rossa report rightly points out, there is still room for improvement, as evidenced by the fact that the lack or refusal of information still accounts for the greatest proportion of admissible complaints to my office. Only last week, in response to a complaint from a Member of this House, I called on the Council to review its refusal to decide to meet publicly whenever it is acting in its legislative capacity. The Constitution for Europe provides for the Council to meet in public when considering and voting on a draft legislative act, but surely citizens should not have to wait until the Constitution enters into force for this basic advance in openness. I firmly believe that deliberating behind closed doors on issues that affect the daily lives of our citizens is something we cannot reasonably defend, especially now when all Member States have solemnly signed the text of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted to see that the De Rossa report emphasised the importance of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which elaborates on crucial elements of openness such as providing reasons for decisions and being service-minded and accessible in relations with the public. I too regret that the Code is not yet fully applied by all the institutions and bodies, but expect the incoming Commission to build upon the commitments of Mrs de Palacio and begin working promptly towards a European administrative law, as envisaged in the Constitution for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the Ombudsman's Statute, in order to maintain confidence in the institution, the Ombudsman must be able to investigate the complaints that citizens entrust to him as thoroughly and as rigorously as possible. During this legislature, I very much hope to have the opportunity to revisit the issue of the Statute, notably on the questions raised by the rapporteur regarding the Ombudsman's access to documents and the hearing of witnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, on enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Petitions, this is something that I am eager to develop. In direct response to the suggestion in the De Rossa report, I see only advantages in the committee becoming a fully integrated member of the European network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies. This network has proved a vital tool in terms of effective complaint handling and exchange of best practice. We will continue to strengthen the network, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that the rights provided for under EU law become a daily reality for citizens. I would therefore be delighted if the committee were to become fully engaged in this initiative. With Parliament's agreement, I will see to it that my office makes the practical arrangements to implement this proposal in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year the European Ombudsman will be celebrating its first ten years of existence. It is my sincere belief that the relationships of goodwill, trust and understanding that have been built up over this period provide an excellent basis for further improving the quality of administration, to the benefit of citizens. The European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman in this regard. I look forward to ever stronger cooperation between our institutions in the future and I thank you very much for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Rossa (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that having become accustomed to compressing my thoughts into 60 seconds, it is something of a luxury to have five minutes to expound upon any issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the report. I would also like to thank him for the excellent job he has done since his appointment. He has confirmed the confidence that this Parliament placed in him on his appointment in April 2003. In my view, he has more than justified that confidence. I would also like to pay tribute to the former Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, who undertook groundbreaking work in establishing the Ombudsman's office.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros has engaged in an astonishing level of activity, not only in dealing with the thousands of complaints he has received, but in preparing his office for enlargement and in visiting almost all of the Member States, including all ten new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most striking statistics in his report – apart from the ever rising number of complaints, which the Ombudsman quite rightly points out is not necessarily a feature of deteriorating administration – is the fact that 75% of the complaints received by the Ombudsman's office did not in fact relate to his mandate. That is not necessarily a bad thing, because it clearly indicates that the citizens see the Ombudsman's office as a port of call for problems they have with European institutions. The Ombudsman very correctly ensures that all of those complaints are redirected to those bodies which can provide some redress for citizens, whether that is the Petitions Committee, the national Ombudsman offices, or other national institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Ombudsman's office clearly is to ensure that there is good administration by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The important role that the Petitions Committee plays is of course at the other side of that equation, where we seek to ensure that national governments and local authorities comply with European law in the interests of the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are dealing with today identifies a number of key reforms which in the view of the Petitions Committee need to be carried out if we are to ensure the democratic functioning of the European Union. Openness, transparency and accountability are key building blocks to building a European demos. We argue therefore that there is now a need, in the light of ten years' experience of the Ombudsman's office, to review its statute. This need is also a result of the establishment of OLAF and indeed the fact that, quite shortly, we are hopefully going to ratify a constitution which contains a charter of citizens' rights and which will clearly enhance the role of the citizen in Europe. The review must be undertaken by the European Parliament in cooperation with the Ombudsman's office and I hope that we can get review under way quite soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also needs to amend its procedures to allow parliamentary scrutiny and investigation by the Ombudsman of the infringement procedures. We are currently denied the right to scrutinise those procedures, which I believe is improper. The Council, in my view, must now accept Parliament's amendments to the Ombudsman's statute on access to documents, as the Ombudsman pointed out. This Parliament, through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Almeida Garrett report, pointed out that there was a need to amend that statute, because at the moment, Article 3(2) imposes restrictions in terms of the Ombudsman's investigative powers and, as it is currently worded, denies access to documents which can be refused on duly substantiated grounds of secrecy and accuracy. Access to documents from a Member State that are classified as secret may be granted only where that Member State has given its prior agreement. In addition, employees of the institutions called on to testify must speak 'in accordance with the instructions from their administrations and shall continue to be bound by their duty of professional secrecy'.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an acceptable situation in this day and age. The Ombudsman, in whom Parliament and the other institutions have put their confidence, does not have access to documents and is denied access in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to urge the Commission – pending the adoption of a legally binding code of good administration for all three institutions, which is provided for in the new constitution – to now buy into the voluntary common code which the Council and the Parliament are already applying. It would be right and proper that they should do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final brief remark to make. This Parliament needs to review the manner in which the Council deals with Question Time in this House. I sat in on Question Time yesterday and the President-in-Office refused to answer virtually every single supplementary question put to him. I believe this to be contempt for Parliament and I intend to make a formal complaint, but I also believe we need to review how we deal with this. We either have a real Question Time where the Council is held to account in this Parliament, or we abandon Question Time entirely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are aware, this debate comes at a critical time, when the new parliamentary term has just begun and the procedure for appointing the future European Ombudsman is underway.</p>
<p class="contents">During last year’s debate on the report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2002, the Commission took the opportunity to congratulate the first European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, on the role he had played in establishing a European ombudsman system, and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros, his successor, for the excellent work he has carried out. Mr Diamandouros took up his post in April 2003, and has improved the efficiency of the institution he represents in promoting good public administration and respect for the rule of law and human rights. The contribution he has made has been an invaluable one, both for the Commission and for the European public as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the stepping up of contacts with national and regional authorities which act as mediators between citizens and public administrations in the Member States has made it possible to heighten the role of the European Ombudsman and bring the institution to the attention of the European public, something which the Ombudsman has highlighted. This is of paramount importance, as institutions which no one knows about will not be used, and their value will not be demonstrated. Both the Commission and the Ombudsman have taken note of the increase in the number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman, and the Commission believes that this increase will continue as the effects of enlargement become apparent. Furthermore, I agree entirely with the Ombudsman’s comments to the effect that an increase in the number of complaints does not mean that the situation on the ground is lacking in any way; it simply means that citizens are gaining an ever greater awareness of their rights, and this can only be a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the handling of cases, the Commission is delighted that in many instances the European authorities have taken measures which are likely to lead to a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as amendments to the Statute of the European Ombudsman are concerned, it is now up to Parliament to take the initiative and to take a majority decision, with the approval of the Council, as the Commission’s role will merely be to give an opinion. You can however be sure, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission will examine any new initiative carefully and with an open mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not wish to act hastily with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which will be binding upon all EU institutions and bodies. The inspiration for the Commission’s Code, which entered into force in November 2000, mainly came from proposals put forward by the Ombudsman. The first implementation report only covers the year 2001, and so we do not yet have the hindsight needed to put forward a proposal on an interinstitutional code. We will therefore continue to work on the basis of more thorough information to ascertain whether this Code needs amending, and, if so, how it should be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission concurs with Parliament’s proposals relating to EPSO, the interinstitutional body which was recently established to draw up reserve lists from among the best candidates in open competitions in line with the needs indicated by each institution. Selection procedures must respect the rules and practices relating to transparency and openness which have been established over time, thanks in particular to the Ombudsman’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports Parliament’s call to the EU institutions and bodies to apply the Regulation regarding public access to documents. The Commission would like to point out that Regulation 1049/2001 will in future also apply to EU agencies, which should make it easier to resolve various complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to access to documents relating to infringement procedures, what matters is that the Commission has the room for manoeuvre it needs to conduct its enquiries independently. A balance must be found between the principle of transparency and the confidentiality necessary for dialogue between the Commission and the Member States. The Commission’s practices comply with the case-law of the Court of First Instance. The Commission has revised its working practices for infringement procedures which have been closed, and documents are frequently made available on the basis of a case-by-case analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr De Rossa, Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is what the Commission has to say for the time being in response to the report that has been put forward. The Commission would also like to extend its sincere thanks, on its own behalf and on behalf of all citizens, to the Committee on Petitions for its excellent work. I should like to take this opportunity to remind the chairman of this committee that I myself held this office 15 years ago. The Committee on Petitions is making a tremendous contribution to citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, our duties do not end with approving the annual report. We all need to take note of its basic conclusions and bear them in mind for further action.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take account of the information given and to call for the lack of open character and absence of transparency in the operation of the European institutions to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that 75% of complaints do not come within the scope of the European Ombudsman does not reflect badly on the institution, because these complaints were referred to other agencies. However, what is important for us is the analysis of the 25% of complaints accepted, two-thirds of which relate to the European Commission, in other words, the Community institution which takes decisions which impact on citizens. Complaints were, of course, also made about the European Parliament and the Council, but for services such as the Personnel Selection Office.</p>
<p class="contents">One might, however, say that, even if we take account of the 40% increase in the number of complaints which Mr Diamandouros announced in 2004, few of the 425 million European citizens took recourse to the European Ombudsman, an institution which has already been up and running for ten years and which has been served with acknowledged success and strengthened by the presence of both the first Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, and his current successor, Nikiforos Diamandouros.</p>
<p class="contents">As the elected representatives of European citizens, however, we cannot permit that even one citizen should not enjoy the provisions of Articles 41, 42 and 43 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which now forms part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, as approved by the Council. It may not recognise extrajudicial remedies, but if, in accordance with Article 1(2) of the new Constitution, decisions must be taken both as openly and closely to citizens as possible, the role of the European Ombudsman and of the administrative Commissioners is a guarantee of honest administration, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget that our obligations to reinforce the efficiency of the institution must be implemented and we welcome the Commissioner's statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would emphasise that it is to the credit of the European Ombudsman that he is conducting five own initiative investigations, the most exemplary being into the abolition of discrimination against the disabled on the part of European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I should also like to express thanks for the proper and mutual transmission of cases, for the benefit of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would also like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his outstanding speech in which he outlined his activity as European Ombudsman. To the socialists the most important thing is to reinforce the quality of democracy by placing the citizen in the centre of our work. Most of our goals were echoed in both Mr Diamandouros’ and Mr De Rossa’s report; however, there are lots of areas to be further improved in order to provide the best possible service to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we call upon institutions to act as if the Constitutional Treaty were in force, especially with regard to the Council. When acting as a legislative body, they should do so in a public and transparent manner. I especially welcomed the Ombudsman’s recommendation in this field. The strengthening of European democracy is not possible without openness and transparency and it is unfortunate that there is still no transparency and that the Council continues to act behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we support the work of the European Fundamental Rights Agency. As you know, the committee has just recently published a discussion document. I sincerely hope that the committee will thoroughly and comprehensively consult those who are involved in the representation and protection of citizenship rights, namely the Committee on Petitions of this House and the European Ombudsman. The institution of the Ombudsman will be ten years old next year, and therefore it would be timely to review the reform of the Ombudsman’s status. Let us define the areas in which the institution of the European Ombudsman can be strengthened, for instance in the area of accessibility to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to welcome Mr Diamandouros’ commitment, with which he deepened mutual cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and his liaison network. I am grateful for his help with our information campaign, which aims to familiarise citizens with the rights granted to them by the Constitutional Treaty and to make known to them their right to petition Parliament and lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman. Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to conclude my remarks by pointing out to you, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out so many times, that the only way citizens will trust and believe in the Union is if their rights become part of their daily reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has improved the definition of the content of European citizenship, which had already been introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. The protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens has thus made progress, in an improvement of relations between the Union and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though they enjoy rights and are subject to Community rules relating to their activities, citizens today have few options for defending themselves against any cases of maladministration, and there is thus an ever more urgent need to guarantee civil coexistence in the best possible way and to come up with practical responses to society’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s task is to put forward appropriate solutions and to assert the fundamental rights and safeguards of the individual. The institution of the Ombudsman is the most obvious expression of that sovereignty which is rooted in the people, and which acts in defence of individual rights against the institutions, from which citizens ask to be protected. At heart, the European Ombudsman and the whole system of European local ombudsmen offer every citizen the opportunity to refer to them and, if necessary, to make use of their services, to make the European institutions more transparent and efficient, and to contribute to the Union’s enlargement to include other applicant countries, while fostering the development of a culture of protecting citizenship rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman is, therefore, the port of call for any citizen who feels his or her rights have been violated: he may investigate and put forward solutions in cases of maladministration by the Community institutions and, if the conciliation solutions he suggests fail, he may make recommendations or refer the issue to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the annual report which our Ombudsman has presented to us, to date he has been busy – and in this he has also been effectively aided by the network of European national and local ombudsmen – with a huge range of issues: tax provisions, project funding, rules on competition, discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, health, income or other reasons, late payments, contractual disputes, arbitrary discrimination, lack of transparency or the refusal of various EU institutions to provide access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of his timely and impartial actions is therefore obvious to all. His office, introduced into the Community system by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, now mainly operates within the area of defending citizens faced with a jungle of regulations and orders, which are already extensive within individual countries, and which will become ever more complex as a more complete supranational legal system is built.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the European Parliament, in thanking the Ombudsman, ought to undertake to highlight the importance of his office, as well as the Committee on Petitions itself, which is its operational arm for analysis, monitoring and making proposals, so as to foster the process of democratisation and social cohesion. With the work of the European Ombudsman, assisted by the Commission and its technical systems, it is now possible to better consolidate the concept of European citizenship, to publicise and promote a culture of defence of the people in Europe, moving from a model of bureaucracy which weighs upon the EU institutions to one of defence of the people, and above all of power to the people – in other words, democracy in action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this qualitative leap, I approve in organisational terms of the report which was presented to us today. In this way we will be able to continue to reinforce the system protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the principles of cooperation and subsidiarity, in such a way that European citizens truly become masters, and not merely an electorate that is called upon to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report on the European Ombudsman offers a very clear picture of the type of problems facing the citizens when dealing with European administration. Amongst other things, the report notes that, despite the work done, in particular by the European Ombudsman and his team, the citizens are still experiencing problems obtaining information and documents from the institutions. It is also necessary to do considerably more work to ensure that the process for selecting civil servants is more transparent and more based on merit.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also shows us that, if we want to ensure that the European Union is more accepted by the citizens, and that the citizens comply with the laws laid down by the Union, it is essential not to give the impression that some people are above the law. This does not just affect the European institutions, but also the Member States, since they participate in the development of Europe via the Council and they are equally responsible for applying European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we have presented amendments stressing the need to take account of the Commission’s future role as guardian of the Treaties, particularly at this time, with the European Constitution about to be ratified. While we are all aware that the mandate of the European Ombudsman only applies, amongst other things, to the European institutions, his office plays an important role in terms of monitoring the correct application of Community legislation. I would therefore urge the European Ombudsman, in cooperation with Parliament and its Committee on Petitions, as well as the European Commission, to establish the necessary criteria to clarify when an infringement procedure should be opened and the principles on which those measures will be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer to the amendments I have presented concerning the need to establish a general system of non-judicial measures, in order to give the citizens more power. This amendment is based, once again, on the fact that the role of the European Ombudsman is to give the citizens the opportunity to express their views on issues that affect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome both the European Ombudsman's report and that of the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, and congratulate them on their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Sinn Fein is committed to an EU that is accessible to the people. We support measures that make the work of the EU more transparent, accountable, efficient and effective. The citizens of the European Union demand and deserve institutions that deal with their concerns and complaints in a professional and open manner, and which are prepared to admit their failures and bring about adequate redress.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the rapporteur makes clear in his report, a number of bodies, including the European Commission, have not adhered to recommendations and regulations on access to public documents. It is both regrettable and unacceptable that a number of institutions did not give full disclosure of documents to the Ombudsman's office. I want to reinforce the recommendation in the rapporteur's report that the Ombudsman should have unlimited access to documents in connection with any inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the EU Ombudsman brings into focus the wider debate on accountability – or, more accurately, the lack of accountability – within the European Union. As welcome and as necessary as the work of the EU Ombudsman is, that office is not a panacea for the European Union's democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be realistic and clear. Transparency, accountability and trust will not be secured through the effective operation of the EU Ombudsman's office alone. Significant political change is required. We must seriously go about the job of democratising the European Union. We must create an EU that complements the role of the Member State, not one that undermines it. We need an EU that allows local and regional democracy to flourish and which respects the sovereignty of Member States and their people. Without this reorientation the Ombudsman's role, however worthy, can only be overwhelmed by our democratic deficit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the situation, aren't we lucky to have Mr Diamandouros! Please consider first, however, the situation that gives rise to an Ombudsman: a fundamental shift from real democracy to process democracy. It is a shift of power from the people to the bureaucrats, creating not a democracy, but a democracy-flavoured bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In a real democracy there is no need for an Ombudsman. People speak for themselves, directly through their votes and through local participation. If their representatives do not reflect their will, they are replaced. Do the people know that they have lost their power? They certainly have not been told. If a vote were a unit of currency and real power was an item in a shop, it would be interesting to compare our buying power now to that we enjoyed 20 years ago or 20 years before that. I believe we would find that there has been a cheapening of democracy. At some level people know that their democratic currency has been devalued. A growing awareness is mirrored in the chronically low election polls in European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this democratic deficit, I must be thankful that we have an Ombudsman to fight our corner – a corner that, in a democracy, we should be able to fight ourselves. I am even more thankful that given the endless, faceless bureaucracy that people have to deal with in our process democracy, we have, as this report points out, a well-intentioned Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, even as I direct constituents to the Ombudsman, I will continue to insist on a return of power to the people, which will lead to a real democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Extremely close cooperation exists between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, as both these institutions deal directly with citizens’ concerns, as well as contacting citizens directly and being directly contacted by citizens. Nowadays, it is often said that EU institutions are removed from the life of citizens. When the public feels that it has no connection with what is happening in the European Union, the office of Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are institutions to which all citizens can turn with their concerns and be sure that these concerns will be dealt with, or at least that they will receive a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens’ problems are of paramount importance, and the roles played by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are therefore also of great significance. We cooperate very closely with the Ombudsman, and believe he does a very good job. As well as cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, cooperation also exists with this House in the case of extremely important matters, including those which Parliament examines on the initiative of the Ombudsman and those upon which the Committee on Petitions has given an opinion. It has now become abundantly clear that the role played by the Ombudsman, an institution set up in opposition, so to speak, to the other institutions, is a fundamental one.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are examining the report for the year 2003, upon which Mr De Rossa has spoken on behalf of our committee. We have a very high opinion of the Ombudsman’s work. I should merely like to add that, for obvious reasons, the institution of ombudsman never used to exist in Communist countries. It was only as Communism declined, in its final days, that the post of ombudsman was created in Poland. This post is gaining greater authority in my homeland with every parliamentary term. It was also a pleasure for me to hear that Mrs Reding, the Commission representative, once held the post that it is my privilege to hold today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am the mayor of a small town just outside Rome and, in the course of my administrative duties, I have had occasion to remark on the importance of the role of the ombudsman, as an interface and filter between the administration and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Although he operates in a different context, the European Ombudsman must – or ought to – be a modern, effective and efficient point of contact between the Community institutions and Europeans, bringing us closer to making a reality of every citizen’s fundamental right to sound administration conducted by means of transparent and fair criteria, as enshrined in the Nice Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the course that has been embarked upon, of instituting a network of ombudsmen and other national and local bodies to which the complaints may be referred where the Ombudsman does not have jurisdiction. Efforts to create a complete and useful system of extra-judicial resources for European citizens should be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, following these first months of work as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I must nevertheless say that, as demonstrated by the data in the report we are debating, excellently drafted by Mr De Rossa, there is still considerable disinformation and confusion over the precise areas of competence of the European Ombudsman. Even though in 2003 work progressed in due fashion, in accordance with the procedures, it is important to make a significant change in the way that individual European citizens perceive the Ombudsman by bringing his office, which up to now has been too remote, closer to daily life.</p>
<p class="contents">The hoped-for review of the Ombudsman’s statute ought to focus on this aspect to increase the real, concrete chances of finding solutions to the problems submitted to him. We need a European Ombudsman who can become a genuine link between the Community, the <span class="italic">polis</span> and the institutions which govern it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on a cogent report, and join him in thanking Mr Söderman for his services as Ombudsman and Mr Diamandouros for his time served to date.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make five quick points. One, the Commission should reconsider its antipathy to a more open and effective control of Member States, particularly in regard to the implementation of Community law on public access to documents relating to the infringement procedure. Two, the Code of Administrative Behaviour should be observed by all the EU's institutions and bodies, not excluding the Commission itself. My Group will press this cause until it is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, my Group is wholly in support of an increase and improvement in the Ombudsman's investigative powers. Four, we have heard that 75% of the complaints are declared inadmissible. We must have a continuing education campaign throughout the European Union to improve the awareness of the Ombudsman and indeed the petitions procedure amongst our citizens. Five, finally I would urge the Commission and the Council to insist on – indeed to demand – firm deadlines by which responses to the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petitions and, above all, to the petitioners or complainants, are made. As a school report might say, all in all, so far so good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. Contrary to criticism, the regulation on public access to documents works quite well. I urge the Commission to accept our demand for a revision of that regulation, especially in respect of the new Constitution. If the Council is to meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity, we need a definition of a 'legislative capacity'.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott's remarks. It seems she has left the Chamber, but she indicated that the Ombudsman is a manifestation of an undemocratic process. Is she stating that the Scandinavian countries with an ombudsman enshrined in their constitutions are undemocratic? If that is what she means to say, then she should apologise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say to another honourable Member, who I believe is a member of UKIP – she must be sleeping! – that the role of an ombudsman reinvigorates and reinforces the democratic process. It is a part of the appeal process and it is about recourse to natural justice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the infringement proceedings, I do not share the opinion that the infringement proceeding process is being abused by the Commission. The infringement process often leads to a judicial process. To make such documents public before a decision to go to the courts is made is to undermine either side in that legal process.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Diamandouros and the House for listening so politely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European citizens would all agree that they sent a clear message in every direction. They do not feel that Europe expresses their views, concerns them or protects them on a daily basis. In particular young people, women and socially excluded groups of citizens in general ascribe the disdain which they experience on a daily basis to the policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, compared with this more general trend, we see that European citizens' confidence in the institution of the European Ombudsman has risen astronomically. As the statistics show, complaints by European citizens this year alone are expected to increase by 40%. If we interpret these statistics, apart from confirming that the institution was worthily represented both by Mr Söderman and by my compatriot, Mr Diamandouros, we find that European citizens are rewarding an institution which satisfies the obvious for them, by which I mean access to the institutions of the European Union. However, what is needed in order for the institutions to function better and be considered worthy, apart from the personalities which represent them, is for them to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">We often speak of the democratic deficit, of the lack of transparency or political will in a way which automatically forces my generation to classify them using political <span class="italic">clichés</span>. So let us therefore simply stop stating the problems and let us look for feasible solutions, solutions in deed, not in word, while at the same time supporting the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, a fact that the new Constitution safeguards the institution of the Ombudsman and promotes, perhaps not perfectly, but certainly better than today, transparency and democratic participation in the Union. If we support both, perhaps at the next elections we shall be surprised, this time pleasantly. Perhaps we shall start to regain the confidence of the citizens and convince them to participate more in the common ventures of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is changing. That was the slogan of the last European elections. Personally, I am convinced. However, it is up to all of us to change in a positive direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note that 2,500 complaints were received by your Office in 2003. In my view that is very low. In Ireland roughly the same number of complaints are made annually, and we are rather small compared to the EU. I also note, however, that there was a 40% increase in the number of complaints over the year in question. I suppose that is because of the work you have done in making your office more familiar to the public. I do not think it is because the EU institutions work better than Member State institutions. All institutions suffer from the problem of protecting themselves rather than looking after the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit, but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties. As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution, so I share the problems that the citizens have. I would like to say that, in general, a more client-focused approach by all of the institutions would make you redundant, though I do not think that will happen in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">At national level, at least in Ireland, the Office of the Ombudsman has been a very positive force for change. It has changed the system and the culture, and I believe that your office should be a similar force for change, not just a problem-solving office for the individual but one that can change the system for all citizens and for the better.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mitchell (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in 2003 the European Ombudsman dealt with 363 inquiries. Of the 2 436 complaints received, 250 of those inquiries were initiated in 2003 and 110 were inquiries which were not closed at the end of December 2002. I would like to make two observations about these figures. Firstly, on the face of it this seems a very small number of inquiries compared with the complaints received and begs the question, even if the EU citizen knows that the European Ombudsman exists, does he or she know what he know what he actually does?</p>
<p class="contents">It may upset the consensus here this morning, and I do not mean any offence by this, but could many of the new Members of this Parliament even name the Ombudsman? I doubt very much that they could. I would like to point out that 66.9% of those inquiries related to the European Commission – so much for the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. However, for fear that we will become complacent in this House, 10.7% of the inquiries referred to the European Parliament, the second highest number.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while the 10% increase in complaints to the Ombudsman is not to be welcomed, we should recognise and interpret these figures within the context of the efforts that the office has made to increase its profile. However, could the 54% increase announced today by the Ombudsman be connected to the fact that a lot of Members of the European Parliament were in election mode and generating publicity? I note what has been said about EPSO and I would urge that greater efforts be made to remove the difficulties which exist there.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to reiterate the importance of the many roles of the Ombudsman and to wish him well in his duties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be very brief. I wish to thank all the Members of the House who honoured me with their remarks for the constructive nature of those remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Reding for her comments and to point out that, as 13 years ago she was chairman of the Committee on Petitions, she has the experience needed to appreciate the kind of work done by that committee and by the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Libicki, chairman of the Committee on Petitions, for his comments, and to assure him that I look forward to working closely with him in promoting the joint and common goals of the Ombudsman in that committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not answer all the comments individually, but would like to make some general points. I would urge the Commission to revisit the issue of the Code. The Commissioner might have been too modest in saying that she does not have the information at the moment to be able to assess the possibility of moving forward. To the extent that this is possible, I assure her that I am at her and the Commission's disposal to help move this issue forward for the benefit of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to documents, transparency and the promotion of non-judicial means are, and will remain, at the top of my priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by making three remarks. In addition to the 54% increase in complaints this year, we have also experienced a 62% increase in admissible complaints. This suggests that more and more people are coming to us for the right reasons. That suggests, in turn, that we have been successful in informing people of how to proceed correctly and about what we can do for them.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the fact that 70% of the complaints were made against the Commission. This clearly does not suggest that the Commission is working worse. It simply reflects the fact that it is with the Commission that the vast majority of citizens have dealings. It is inevitable that the majority of complaints made will be against the Commission. The degree of resolution and cooperation we receive from the Commission is high. I will keep on top of this situation, and remain very conscious of the need for me to act as a control mechanism in respect of the institutions, including the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I want to go on record again in thanking Mr De Rossa for his report, thanking the Committee on Petitions and thanking this House for its support. I remain committed to serving the citizens with your cooperation and support.</p>
