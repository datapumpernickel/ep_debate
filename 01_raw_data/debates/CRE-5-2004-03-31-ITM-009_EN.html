<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, with regard to this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, perhaps the first thing we should remember is that it is the second most expensive agreement signed by the European Union, after the Agreement with Mauritania. Furthermore, there is a difference between the two agreements I have mentioned, which we call the difference between the ‘northern agreements’ and the ‘southern agreements’. The northern agreements have a whole series of characteristics, which I will explain during my speech, which differentiate them from the southern agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has been said about this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, all kinds of things have been said and almost all of it is true. For example, the Court of Auditors emphasised that the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland did not respect certain basic budgetary rules, fishing opportunities, for example. Of the EUR 42.8 million this agreement costs, just 28 were spent on fishing opportunities and furthermore this included paper fish, so called because they were fish that, although they were paid for, did not exist in Greenland’s waters because they had disappeared long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the fact that the use of fishing quotas was very low and was far from achieving the value expected for fishing opportunities, only four Member States could and can fish within the framework of this Agreement: the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Denmark. The other Member States were and continue to be excluded from these waters.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that this exclusion and this non-use of fishing quotas paid for caused and continues to cause a series of distortions such as, for example, the case of certain Member States benefiting from the agreement having tried to re-sell unused quotas, because they are not of interest to the consumer market of that Member State, but they are of interest for consumption in other States. In addition to this distortion (the attempt to re-sell something already paid for), there has been and there still is fishing of unused quotas by vessels flying the flags of those Member States, but which in reality are not from those Member States or any other Member State, but which are third-country vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there is a desire to acquire these unused quotas, or at least to begin fishing, though of an experimental nature, on the part of certain Member States which are not included as beneficiaries of this agreement or which were excluded – such as the Iberian fleets: the Spanish and the Portuguese – at the time of our accession to the European Community, despite the fact that we have been fishing in those waters for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognised all these distortions in its document and proposed a mechanism according to which the Commission could temporarily transfer unused fishing opportunities to another Member State, only during that particular year and without prejudice to the allocation of quotas in future years.</p>
<p class="contents">We thought this was a good mechanism, above all because it was a trial mechanism and it would be possible to verify whether it worked or not as time passed. However, in the Committee on Fisheries an amendment was approved, presented by nationals of certain Member States involved, to the effect that the Commission could establish consultation procedures between the Member States, but that it would be the States which had the quotas who could determine or decide on their distribution or allocation to other Member States which are not beneficiaries but which have an interest in fishing in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in reality, the central debate in relation to this issue is whether the Commission only plays a facilitating role or whether, since we are talking about a Community fisheries agreement, it must ensure the best possible level of use of fishing opportunities which, as I have said, have been acquired and paid for from Greenland by the Community, within the framework of this Fisheries Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are talking essentially not about national issues – because, in the fisheries agreements, in general – and those of us who are here are well aware of this – national issues are always very prevalent and they always cause many tensions – but about the principle of good financial management, the Gordian knot of this issue. It is a question of defining this principle in relation to principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and ensuring compliance, by means of the monitoring of performance indicators, which are established by activity and which furthermore are measurable, so that the results achieved can be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this from the standpoint of somebody who has worked on this Agreement for a long time and who I believe has a thorough knowledge of it. Furthermore, Greenland is entirely in favour of the approach I have just expressed here – in fact, it has already reached an agreement with the Commission – and I believe this would be a good signal for us to send to two Community fleets: to let them fish – not everything, but at least a bit – in those waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am happy to note that the Member supports this proposal. The Greenland Protocol has been subject to serious criticism in the past. I believe that the revised version of the Protocol is an important step in the right direction. On the basis of the mandate given by the Council on 24 February 2003, the evaluation report done by the Commission services and the report of the European Parliament adopted on 2 September 2003, the Commission initialled the modified Fourth Protocol on 18 June 2003 in Athens. I should like to highlight the main new elements,</p>
<p class="contents">A substantial adjustment of quotas has been carried out in order, among other things, to delete cod 'paper fish' and align the fishing possibilities with scientific advice: no more cod, redfish in Western waters or blue whiting; and, in the European Union fishing capacity, no more 'paper fish'. Licence fees have been introduced in order to have burden-sharing between the Community and ship owners. This is in line with the reform of the common fisheries policy, aligns the agreement with other third-country agreements and, last but not least, gives the Commission the possibility of monitoring the fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As a response to the lack of transparency, a budgetary support programme has been introduced, and the Greenland Home Rule Government has committed itself to performing a structural reform of its fisheries policies. The Greenland authorities have committed themselves to restructuring their fisheries sector towards more privatisation and fewer subsidies. They have also committed themselves to increasing substantially the budget of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources so that it can increase its scientific capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Experimental fisheries are promoted and extended to cephalopods and clams. If successful, this may be the answer both to the diversification needed in Greenland fisheries and to the new species to be included in the next European Community – Greenland agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of low utilisation of fishing possibilities and the waste of Community funds, the standard transfer clause making it possible for the Commission to reallocate under-utilised fishing possibilities to other non-quota older Member States has been introduced. This is in full respect of the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation. This is a crucial new element which not only gives the Commission the means to ensure the sound financial management of Community funds and optimal use of tax-payers' money, but also brings the Greenland Agreement into line with other third-country agreements with financial compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been told that it is and we can only agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards catches and financial compensation it is one of the EU’s most important fisheries agreements ever. Secondly, it is an excellent example of sustainability and balance in the waters of the North Atlantic. Improvements have definitely been made. Thirdly, it is also an expression of the special relationship between the former EC member Greenland and the Union. I am not of course telling you anything new when I say that the European fisheries policy is a genuine Community policy, with all that entails. There are Community legal bases and principles that are binding. These include, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the principle of relative stability which was confirmed only recently as part of the large-scale common fisheries policy reform. I find it highly questionable and unhelpful to be seeking an amendment by the back door, as I see it, and to give way to sectional interests as seems to be the manifest intention of many here in this House on the Greenland question.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU fishing nations that are party to the Greenland agreement have committed themselves to sustainable and responsible fishing. Otherwise, this agreement would never have come about. They have been given quotas which they can use themselves and which they can exchange. That cannot be changed. We cannot now withdraw those quotas with coercive measures that impinge upon the Member States’ substantive rights. Just imagine if a football team does not use its possibilities for substitution and for that reason is not allowed any substitutes in the next game but is allowed to field a team with twice the number of players. In a word, it is absurd. It cannot be justified by talking about supposedly economic and fair grounds. We do not need imposed redistribution; what we need is partnership and cooperation. Everyone involved has repeatedly assured us that they want to make the best possible use of quotas, and we believe them. As we have seen, Germany, where I come from, has been exemplary in its cooperation in the past few years – I am pleased to be able to say that – and has transferred parts of its quotas for stocks that are in good condition to other Member States. That is the way to have a sustainable fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future I am in favour of closer cooperation over quotas; that is something I can concede, but the Member States’ and Commission’s powers must be preserved. I also fully support an improved procedure for consultation between Member States over the exchange of quotas from agreements with third countries. I also ask my fellow Members to support that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you say, Commissioner, we no longer have paper fish or virtual fish. We can, accordingly, establish a relationship between the EU’s financial contributions and the fish that can actually be caught, because there are fish to be caught.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome this modification and Mrs Miguélez Ramos’s report, which is appropriate and well structured. The words in her intervention were similarly welcome, as they enabled us to focus on the central political issue at stake here. I also welcome Commissioner Vitorino’s intervention. His knowledge of fisheries does not surprise me, given that his many talents allow him to speak about fisheries with a remarkable breadth of knowledge. Here was me thinking that all he knew about fish was what he found on the plate ... Seriously, though, I hope that Commissioner Vitorino can come and teach us about particle physics and molecular biology (<span class="italic">laughter</span>); he has the talent and intelligence to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning, however, to the political question raised by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the removal of the Spanish and Portuguese from the Greenland fishing zones is both unjust and ‘anti-historic’ – now that ‘the destiny of history’ has gone out of fashion, please allow me to use the term ‘anti-historic’. If the Spanish and Portuguese were the first to discover fishing routes across the globe, then they must also have discovered the fisheries in Greenland, from where they have now been banned. We now have the chance to rectify this injustice, and this opportunity to rectify injustice consists of allowing quotas not taken up by the States holding them to be used by Portugal and Spain. This must not mean that these two countries must be subordinate to the authority of the countries holding the quotas. This is not some kind of modern-day feudal law invented alongside the quotas that are assigned to one country, which later passes them on or not to the EU Member State that, within the scope of Community policy, wishes to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wholeheartedly support the position of Mrs Miguélez Ramos that the European Union and the Commission can assign unused fishing quotas to countries wishing to use them, such as Portugal and Spain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should be applied to all fisheries agreements and not just this one. We feel that we need a clear separation with regard to what the money is there for.</p>
<p class="contents">In development, the money would go to surveillance and scientific analysis etc., and there should also be the possibility of an audit of how the money is spent. There is a major vacuum here in that European taxpayers' money goes to fund these fisheries agreements without the possibility of looking to see how the money has been spent, particularly when it is in the area of development and surveillance. We – and European citizens – would like to see guarantees that this is where this money is going, rather than taking it at face value. In many cases I do not believe that we have a guarantee that the money has gone where we expect it to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the access in this agreement is for northern countries, and in the Commission's proposal it says that this may be reallocated. Members in the committee wanted the wording 'shall be reallocated'. This idea that if it is not being used up then it has to be reallocated to other countries is a bad idea, as we need first of all to look and see how we can try to reduce capacity, and if it is not being utilised, there may be very good valid reasons. For example, maybe there is not enough fish. So why should we say that it should be reallocated regardless of the reasons for its not being utilised?</p>
<p class="contents">We should be trying to reduce fishing effort because we know that the oceans do not have the capacity to deal with the pressures that are being put on them by the fishing industry in the European Union and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Miguélez Ramos report, in the form it is being presented to plenary today, is worse than the Commission’s proposal. This is why we voted against it in committee, as did the rapporteur herself.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely believe that the Commission’s proposal was good and sufficient, and I believe that it should have been accepted by a majority in the Committee on Fisheries, in which case it would not have been necessary to present amendments to Article 3, since, for the first time, the Commission was responding to a long battle by the PPE-DE Group in this European Parliament and by the Spanish Government for the same criteria to be applied to the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland as to the ‘southern agreements’ and for there not to be fishing opportunities paid for but not used, thereby allowing the Commission directly to re-allocate these unused fishing opportunities to other Member States which request it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino, I would ask you to communicate to Commissioner Fischler that he should go ahead with his proposal, because it is reasonable, fair, equitable and in accordance with the principles of good governance, which the Court of Auditors called for so strongly, favouring the mutual interests of Greenland and the European Union, and, above all, it is a Europeanist proposal, since it protects the common European interest, unlike the current Miguélez Ramos report, which is anti-Community, since it prevents the Commission from directly defending the common interest of all the Member States in re-allocating unused quotas and obliges it to give in to the desire of certain States which do not use those quotas to negotiate bilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe the report to be a step backwards and we will vote against it again if the new Amendment No 5 is not adopted, since it is better than the Amendment No 2 which appears in the current Miguélez Ramos report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that amendment was originally lost in committee but has been re-tabled. My reason for rejecting the amendment is quite simply that it undermines the principle of relative stability. That principle is at the heart of the Scottish and British position on fisheries policy and, I believe, that of other northern states. Any measures which threaten this principle, or put it at risk, I cannot support. The concept of relative stability is vital to the Scottish fleet, as it guarantees historical rights, and Amendment No 5 puts that at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 also transfers competence to the Commission over quota swaps, which, I believe, is against the basic CFP regulation. Competence should rest with the Member State, allowing new entrants to existing fisheries, leading to pressures to reallocate currently guaranteed quota shares. It also ignores the basic differences between southern fisheries agreements, where fishing licences are at stake, and northern agreements where quotas are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it interesting that some people want the Commission to have more responsibility over fisheries, yet when it comes to certain proposals over which the Commission has responsibility, they want to reject it outright. Amendment No 5 is dangerous to northern fishing interests, it goes against the CFP regulation and risks reducing the amount of Greenland quotas that can be used in exchange for quotas for Norway on which the United Kingdom industry relies heavily. I am sorry to disagree with the rapporteur on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that is because he is extremely busy trying to remedy the problems that have been inflicted upon Scotland by the December Fisheries Council in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Greenland, I am sure that many Scots in fishing communities these days would look enviously towards Greenland because it is outwith the CFP. However, while in Scotland we are still stuck with the CFP, it is absolutely essential that the founding principle of relative stability is not violated in any way whatsoever. This report, and its proposal that quotas should be reallocated to different Member States, and reallocated by the Commission, is totally unacceptable. It is a very dangerous precedent that could, and would, be used to undermine relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not helpful that in December 2002 the UK Government and the Scottish Labour and Liberal Government supported reform of the CFP giving equal access to waters and resources. If Commissioner Fischler had been here I would have asked him to comment on how relative stability can live with equal access to waters and resources. The two are not compatible, and I just hope that we can get out of the CFP before relative stability is reviewed or revoked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Fisheries recently had presentations from an eminent scientist, Dr Chris Reid from the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation at Plymouth University. He was explaining to the Committee on Fisheries that global warming, which has caused a rise in the temperature of the North Sea by a significant amount over the last 20 years, has driven the plankton on which the cod feed northwards. It is not surprising, then, that we are witnessing a collapse in cod stocks in the North Sea which has led to the crisis that the Scottish fleet in particular is now confronting, and to the cod recovery plan that the Commission has implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, when you look at the table of proposed fishing opportunities under the modified Fourth Protocol for the Greenland Agreement, you see a reduction in fishing opportunities; a dramatic reduction in cod for a start, which perhaps gives some question to the science on which Dr Chris Reid was informing our committee. It at least indicates that in Greenland waters we do not have the vast abundance of fish that was once indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The good thing about this modification to the Fourth Protocol is that at least now we have no paper fish: we are paying for genuine fishing opportunities. We are relating the money that we pay from the European Union to the actual reality of the fishing opportunities that are there. If such fishing opportunities exist, the people who most require to benefit from those opportunities are the beleaguered fleet operating at present in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason regrettably I have to say, adding my voice and echoing what my colleagues have said this afternoon, that I agree that we cannot support Amendment No 5. Not only does that undermine the principle of relative stability, as Mrs Stihler and Mr Hudghton have eloquently explained, but it would also transfer those potential fishing opportunities away from the North Sea fleet and give them to fishing fleets outwith the North Sea, which would not be acceptable to the fishermen in the UK. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These come not only from the rapporteur of the Committee on Fisheries, but also from the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for the financial expenditure for this agreement to be adapted to the actual situation. Her call for a general evaluation report and a cost-benefit analysis also has my full support. Parliament has been calling for this for a long time for fisheries agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, support the rapporteur’s call for the Commission to reallocate unused fishing opportunities to another Member State on request, even if that allocation were limited to just one fishing campaign. In my opinion, this would have a very serious effect on the common fisheries policy principle of relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of transferring or exchanging allocated fishing quotas must continue to be a Member State competence. After all, the sustainable use of fish stocks benefits from unused fishing opportunities. If parts of allocated quotas go unused because of particular foreseeable circumstances, however, then bilateral contractual arrangements between the Member States are still the appropriate way of dealing with that. The Commission may be allowed to intervene here in a regulatory capacity. Anything more than that, however, would seriously undermine the basis of the common fisheries policy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I wish to begin by making it clear that I have inherited my knowledge on this subject from my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, unfortunately, cannot be here today. However, I will gladly take on board what has been said and try to address as far as possible the arguments put forward in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I shall try to clarify the Commission's position concerning the amendments that have been tabled. First of all on Amendment No 1: the financial compensation of the agreement is one single compensation, which corresponds to access to the waters, as well as compensation for the impact caused by the activity of European Union vessels in third-country waters. The fact that the third country in the framework of a fisheries sector dialogue accepts to commit a part of the financial compensation to activities in support of a reform of its own fisheries policy, does not constitute an argument for a differentiation in two different financial envelopes. The approach of differentiating financial compensation would result in the refusal of the third country to commit itself to reform its fisheries policy. Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 2, which, to a certain extent – if I have understood you correctly – is connected with Amendment No 5, considering the fact that the Commission is responsible for the sound financial management of the Community funds, Amendment No 2 cannot be accepted. Indeed, the budgetary authority must give the Commission the means and the legal basis to ensure the sound financial management of this agreement. Despite some transfers made in 2003 by the quota-holding Member States, experience shows that these have not been sufficient to ensure the optimum utilisation of the fishing possibilities and thus sound financial management. With respect to the argument put forward, how can we guarantee that the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation are adhered to? I would like to underline that the temporary transfer of fishing possibilities from one Member State to another by the Commission is <span class="italic">not</span> contrary to the principle of relative stability, because, in accordance with Article 20(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the allocation of fishing possibilities among Member States, such a transfer will not have an effect on the allocation of fishing possibilities between the Member States in Greenland waters in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The allocation continues – and will continue – to be ruled, on the basis of the distribution keys, as before. The Member States that benefit from a temporary transfer cannot exploit the catches made for the changing of the basis of the allocation for the future. The determination of the fishing possibilities is made on the basis of scientific reports. One innovation of this agreement is precisely that all quotas are now subject to an annual revision, if scientific advice so requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I cannot accept the idea that with this mechanism we are creating a precedent. The transfer clause exists and is implemented in all other third-country agreements with financial compensation, without any problem. The only agreement that does not have this kind of article is precisely the Greenland agreement. That is the situation we want to change now.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that in 2003 the commercial value of the catches, including the real catches of the transfers made to Norway, Iceland and the Faroes amounted to EUR 50 million. Compared to the current financial compensation of EUR 42.82 million, this is not satisfactory. In an agreement with financial compensation, it is unacceptable that the Commission does not have the means to ensure that Community funds are not wasted. Having said that, the Commission welcomes the last amendment – Amendment No 5. We are responsible for ensuring the sound financial management of Community funds. Amendment No 5 shows the willingness of the budgetary authority to provide the Commission with the legal basis to ensure such a ground management without prejudice to relative stability, as I have said before.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 3, we agree with the spirit thereof, but we believe that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament. Therefore, Amendment No 3 is not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 4. I recall in this respect the established principle regarding the nature of a protocol to a fisheries agreement. In light of the fact that this is an annex to the framework agreement, its periodic renewal does not require a new mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This review introduces a range of adjustments, but does not alter the level of financial compensation, which remains at EUR 42 820 000 per year. The review does, however, make a clearer distinction between amounts set aside to compensate fisheries possibilities and support for structural reform. We welcome the increase in halibut quotas, which means that national fleets may now catch 800 tonnes of Greenland halibut. It should be noted, however, that, at the time of the decision, Portugal was excluded from this agreement, despite its historical fishing rights in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the extent to which quotas are under-used, we must ensure that the principle of good financial management is applied, in other words, that the fisheries possibilities offered by the international fisheries agreements are used effectively, without undermining the principle of relative stability. The report and the Commission proposal open up the possibility of redistributing quotas that are not fully used in a given year. We feel, however, that the wording of Amendment No 5 is more acceptable, and that this Amendment should, accordingly, be approved in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
